The sound quality was excellent, but the earpiece is flimsy and irreplacable: terrific electrical engineering, poor mechanical engineering. ---  --- I loved it when it wasn't broken.  Even wind didn't seem to bother the headset much.  The voice quality was great on transmission and reception.  But the earpiece is incredibly flimsy and can't be replaced.  I got a new headset the first time on warranty.  The second time it broke I could have gotten a free replacement again but I didn't want the hassle.  I have a Scala now that I've been using for months and I'm very happy with it, even though the sound and wind-immunity doesn't measure up to the Logitech	neg

Did you lose interest in new rock in the past several years because all those loud songs on the FM station sound about the same?  Maybe you noticed one song in there somewhere that had memorable hooks and interesting lyrics among the crunching guitars?  The Libertines are - or at least were - one of those diamonds in the rough. ---  --- Their raw, loud style is closer to punk than any other genre, but most of their songs are more well-developed than that suggests and might even appeal to classic rock fans.  Make no mistake, though, this is a loud album.  With the exception of the oddly balladish "Radio America," it's a pretty steady sonic assault, and the lyrics are mostly somewhere between "Louie Louie" and live Dylan on the intelligibility scale.  What can be understood is more erudite than you'd expect, though.  "What a Waster" is a frighteningly vivid look at drug addiction, "Boys in the Band" is the best groupie song I've heard in a long time, and "The Good Old Days" actually reveals a touch of sentimentality just under the power chords.  Decipherable or not, most of the other songs are at least very catchy.  The whole collection is a nice balance between aggressive style and memorable songs that has been all too lacking for a long time now. 	pos
The beautiful young Brooke Shields plays 11/12 year old Violet, daughter of Hattie (Susan Sarandon) a New Orleans prostitute living and working in a brothel in 1917. Violet has been raised in the brothel and has not been to school and has known no other life or anything about the outside world. When she turns 12, her virginity is auctioned off. Brooke Shields' portrayal of Violet is poignant and beautiful. Her childish charms and innocence are so heart-wrenchingly sweet. The scene where she jumps up and down on the photographer's bed (very childlike) and asks him whether he will take care of her before throwing her arms around him and giving him small childlike kisses on the nose, forehead etc. and reciting that little rhyme really pulled at my heart strings! I just wanted to jump into the TV and give her a hug!! This, mixed with the seductive adult things that she also says in this scene (and others) is particularly poignant as we know that young Violet is merely reciting what she's heard from the prostitutes. The photographer also says that Violet doesn't know what she's saying. You just want to turn the clock back, hug Violet and give her a proper childhood! The photographer marries her because he's fascinated with her beauty, innocence and is concerned that she is only a child and should not be in a brothel becoming a prostitute. The part where he gives her a doll is poignant as she has already lost her virginity and it seems that he's trying to give back her childhood, sadly she's been exposed to too much, too soon in her life. Susan Sarandon and Brooke Shields are wonderful in this movie as well as Keith Carradine, the photographer. The art aspect & music soundtrack are amazing. This movie deals with a taboo subject seen through the eyes of a child as 'normal' which enhances poignancy and brings out the viewers maternal need to 'rescue' young Violet.	pos
This bracelet looks better than the picture.  It looks beautiful on my wrist. The fifty bucks that I paid for it was a real bargain. I love it. There's only one drawback, it's 8 inches long and that's too long for my wrist. If it fit perfectly, I'd give it ten stars. I'll pay to make it smaller. It's made of titanium, and maybe it's too tough to alter. I want it to fit over that knot on my wrist. If I can get it altered, I'll wear it until the day I die, which I hope will be 100 years from now	pos
This product is very easy to install and use. In couple of minutes, I was able to set it up. I used the phone jack to input the music from cassette player to the computer and it worked well.  --- The reason I give it four star out of five is that it records the music in wave format and there is no software in the package that converts wave file to DVD/CD/MP3 format	pos

The "crema" was pretty thick as it brewed, and the coffee appeared to have a nice dark color. We got a nice strong aroma of coffee and preceded to add some milk (1%) and sugar.  ---  --- Our first impressions...good flavor...a nice cup of coffee. We did enjoy the cup of coffee ---  --- We don't know of any other pod maker that has this flavor and it's really good! We love the way it smells - the way it tastes - and the fact it is just plain different. Most pod people are ignoring the flavored sector to this extent - and it's nice to have a cup of really flavored coffee! Review from singleservecoffee.com --- 	pos
We have had this weather station for a year now an more times then not there are absolutely no readings!  I only get an indoor reading, which I could get from my thermostat!  We have reset it, messed with the sensors, moved it around the house in many locations with a direct site on the outdoor sensors and still no readings.  Its very frusterating when its a hurricane outside and you can't get any wind readings.  This junk cost me a couple of hundred dollars and was a very dissapointing birthday present for my husband!  Also I called customer service and was on hold for over a hour and still never got a human to talk to for help!  Don't buy this product!!	neg

Reasons to buy it: ---  --- 1. Cheap, a mere $140. --- 2. Packed with features. From complete auto mode (point and shoot) to fully manual mode. 4MP and 3X optical zoom good enough for most situations. --- 3. Picture quality is good. It's better than the other two cameras I own (Olympus C720 UZ and Sony DSC S600). --- 4. Compact. It's smaller than it looks in the stock photo. --- 5. Fast. Switches on and is ready for the first shot within about 1.5 seconds. ---  ---  --- Other things I liked about the camera: ---  ---  - Good ergonomics. Fits nicely in my hand, all the buttons are well placed and easy to access. I can even switch on the camera and take pictures with one hand. ---  - Powerful flash. Enough to fill up a moderate size room. ---  - Great video mode with sound. It also comes with an audio video cable so that you can connect the camera to your TV and watch the vidoes and pictures on your TV. ---  - LCD is decent size and is fairly bright, which means it's even visible outdoors in the daytime. ---  ---  --- Things I didn't like about the camera: ---  ---  - Manual could be more detailed. There is a bsaic manual and sort of a quick start guide. But there was no 40 page booklet which explained each and every feature in detail. ---  - The auto focus illuminator (for help in focussing in low light) is a little bright and can be annoying sometimes. But the upside is that you get good focus even in really low light conditions. ---  - Does not come with a battery charger. I bought rechargeable batteries and a charger separately. ---  ---  --- I have owned the Olympus C720 UZ and the newer Sony DSC S600, but I think this camera is better than both of them.	pos

After reading the reviews here and at [...] on this baby, I was a little cocerned about its low-light and indoor performance.  Let me be the first to say that my fears were largely unfounded. ---  --- Yes, if you film in very low light, it will darken many colors.  But we're talking 60 lux, which is the roughly equivalent to the light put off from the candles of a birthday cake.  Just keep the lights on when your kid blows out the candles, and viola!  Seriously, I have had absolutely no problems with it filming too dark indoors, outdoors, or even when I film local bands playing in dark bars. ---  --- The reason I wanted to try this camera was because it is the only flash-based camera that is receiving even mildly positive reviews.  I do not want a tape mechanism that will break, nor a fragile hard drive that cannot be used in many film-worthy conditions (think snow skiing, as the drive mechanism will freeze up on you in very cold weather).   ---  --- As I said, I was skeptical when I purchased it, but no more.  The videos are far better than any other camcorder I've owned.  My last was a Canon ZR 50 mini DV, and this camera takes VASTLY superior videos than that one. ---  --- The four stars is only because of the mpeg2 format this records to.  I have a mac, so editting requires that I convert to DV with streamclip so that imovie can import the movies.  Mainly, I just don't edit my home videos so that hasn't been a problem.  But if would have been nice for it to be an easier option, and it could have been if they encoded to mpeg4 with h264 and mp3/aac, which appears to be the next standard.   ---  --- If that concerns you, or if you want HD, you might wait until the Panasonic SD1 is available because it records in AVHDC which is a form of mpeg4.  Of course, imovie doesn't yet support that either, so you may have to wait until iLife 07 to really use it.   ---  --- In parting, I will also mention that the size of this unit is absolutely fabulous.  I no longer dread lugging around even my smallish mini DV camera.  This thing literally fits in my jacket pocket, so I end up filming a lot more than I did with previous cameras.  If you're looking for small, flash-based, and good quality video, get this camera, you'll love it	pos
I bought these earrings for my 10-year old grandaughter for Christmas.  I think she has worn them everyday since - she loves them.  They are not large hoops; if fact, they are a bit small -- but perfect for her. For an adult, I think a little bit larger size would be better. All in all, I was very pleased with the earrings; the quality is very good.	pos

I thought this product had reasonably good taste, but I have two major issues with it. ---  --- First, they describe this as a  Kettle Corn.  It is not Kettle Corn - not even close.  This is a caramel corn with a thick sweet coating.  Real Kettle Corn is a slightly sweet, slightly salty popcorn. ---  --- Second, each very small bag has 1.5 servings in it.  When was the last time you opened a small bag of snack food and only ate 2/3's of it?  They purposely made the serving size unrealistic to make it look healthier.  The whole point of paying for individual size bags is that it limits you to a set portion.  Remember when a can of Coke had 1.5 servings in it?  The FDA made them change the label. If you eat the whole bag, you are eating 200 calories of popcorn.  No better that a bag of potato chips or a few cookies, so this is not a lesser evil - it's just the same old junk food with a new name. ---  --- I won't buy this product again.  It's the same stuff you can get anywhere	neg

I bought an epilator because I was tired of shaving my legs and waxing was just too expensive for me.  I've had my epilator for several weeks now and I am already seeing amazing results!   ---  --- I used it for the first time on my legs.  I'm not going to lie...It was painful.  I just made sure to go slowly, pausing every few inches, and making sure my skin was pulled as tightly as I could get it.  Eventually, I was able to get most of the thick, dark hairs off of my legs.   ---  --- **Please know that the Epilator is not an immediate "cure-all".  Hair grows in stages, so as soon as you get rid of some hairs, several more grow in behind them.  (Eventually you can probably get rid of most to all of them, but it will take some time.)  Because of this, it is good to try epilating a couple of times a week.  Since it's winter, I just let it all grow out so that the Epilator can get more hairs.  However, when new hair grows in, I am finding that they are thinner and blonde instead of dark brown.  It doesn't hurt nearly as much to pull those out!  I also know that I'll be able to do this in the spring and summer because the hair is lighter.  My legs are smoother and I don't get razor burn!  Right after epilating, sometimes I do experience a little irritation but, unlike razor burn, it goes away after just a short time.     ---  --- Another neat thing is that, unlike waxing, the Epilator can grab the teeny tiny almost invisible hairs.  This gives your skin a smoother feel and it gets hairs at the beginning stages of growth!  I used to have to wait two weeks or so for my hair to grow long enough to be waxed.  Now, I get smoother skin just about whenever I want to!     ---  --- I was a little nervous at first about spending money on a product I had not heard much about.  With the exception of the few reviews I read online, I was pretty much in the dark.  I went ahead and went for it, then realized that this thing paid for itself in about two weeks!  Not only have I epilated my legs, I have also used it under my arms, on my upper lip, and on my bikini line.  The results have been better than I could have imagined!!   ---  --- Again, I'm not going to lie...OUCH!!!!!  Epilating under my arms hurt initially and they were sore for a few days (I have very thick hairs).  However, I got the majority of the hairs and after the first time, I realized that I'm never going to have to shave again!  Yes, some little blonde hairs grow back, but they are ALL thinner and much less painful.  In fact, sometimes it tickles a little.  :o)  I epilate there once to twice a week (about a five minute job if you're being careful, two if you're in a hurry) and I have smoother underarms!   ---  --- I used to get my upper lip waxed about once a month.  Now I just epilate.  It hurts, but just for a second.  Plus, I keep up with it so instead of 50 hairs being pulled at once with hot wax, I only need to pull 5-10 each time.     ---  --- **A word of caution: Our skin is more sensitive in some areas, so if you choose to epilate around the bikini line, be careful.  I managed to give myself a burn from going too slowly with the rotating "blade".  Now I just make sure that I don't leave it in one place for more than a couple of seconds.  If I miss some hairs, I come back another time to get them. ---  --- This epilator comes with a little loufa pad to help reduce ingrown hairs (I've only had a few and the pad fixes them) and a little cleaning brush.  The epilator is very easy to clean.  The top (dark purple section) pops off and you run it under hot water.  When it dries, you put it back on.  **Note, the epilator does not store hairs inside of it.  When they are pulled out, they tend to either gather on the front of the epilator (I stop periodically to wipe them off) or they go flying.  I sit on a towel when epilating to catch most of the hairs.   ---  --- I hope this review was helpful to you with your decision about buying an epilator.  I am very satisfied with this product and I recommend it to anyone who has at least a little pain tolerance and really wants to get rid of hair stop having to shave all the time.   ---  --- **Are the few minutes of pain worth it???  ABSOLUTELY!  :o) ---  ---     --- 	pos
Shoe is comfortable but the description says off white or white with beige.  Which leads you to think the color is mostly white.  The true color is neither!  There is absolutely NO WHITE in these shoes.  I purchased these shoes because I needed some white off/white shoes NOT beige shoes.  No I did not return them it's too much of a hassel to return things so I kept them and I have worn them once but do not like the color at all.  The style is not as cute as her others but they are still a great bargain.  The materials are an excellent quality.  If you like beige & earthtones you will like these shoes	neg
I am glad I purchased my Cardscan 700, but there are some significant unfortunate missed opportunities and because of that some important functions cannot be done at all.  My impression is that this is the best product on the market, due to its scanning properties, which are quite good.  There are some serious deficiencies though in the rest of the software which would be nice to have fixed, and which in some cases render the device somewhat useless, since the output cannot be transferred to a useful place. ---  --- PROs: It does a pretty good job of scanning.  The algorithm is well developed and is actually quite impressive.  Even cards that catch and rotate as they go through, producing a funny smeared image, have some of their contents scanned correctly.  The superiority of this recognition software is the strong point of this product.  There is also an ok database management product that one can use to maintain and look up cards.  Operationally the product is especially nice- I can just sit there feeding cards in and typing carriage return after each one, glancing at the screen to catch errors.  The card image is retained in the record in the Cardscan database, which is important.  ---  --- CONs: 1) the exit path has places that cards can hang up, and they can catch as they go through.  This happens fairly often unless the card is new and flat, so part of the operation is to try to prevent that, by straightening out bent corners ahead of time, and by adding a little force keep the card from catching and rotating as one corner goes forward and the other is stuck.  Quite needless- if the exit path was smooth and continuous, this wouldn't happen - the problem is in the rear of the plastic case.  2) Although the product retains the image of the business card, there's no way to pass that through to Outlook or export it to any other format.  This is very unfortunate.  I could laboriously do that by hand by cutting and pasting each one, except that Cardscan software does not permit copy / paste functions on the image.  Why not?  It's easy to implement.  3) Every time I start the program it harasses me about registering, even though I've been specific that I do not wish to.  It also harasses me about logging in the online backup facility even though I've asked it not to do that.  It therefore ignores the user wishes.  4) The data exchange function allows only extremely crude export to a file, in a simple text or csv format.  There is no way to create an Outlook format .pst file, which would simplify importing, and allow for the future option of including an image.  Outlook can hold an image in the comment section of the record, but apparently Cardscan folks aren't even close to thinking about this.  5) If I indicate that a data export for a file is destined for Outlook, the field names are not set up correctly, so unless I do some heavy editing of field names, nothing much other than the contact name gets across.  If I export directly to the running Outlook program, it isn't perfect, but it's close enough to be usable.  Why did Cardscan get one right and not the other??  In neither case can I send the card image over.  6) I was forced to install Microsoft .NET software even though I intended to do all my exports via files.  I didn't get a choice- if I didn't install .NET, the installer stopped and exited without installing any Cardscan software.	neg

First of all, it seems a bit silly to defend the smell of any product, as everyone has different oppinions on this. I happen to love the smell, but I am writing this review to talk about what this product actually does; which is transforms hair. I have naturally curly hair, and awhile back I chopped it all off on a hairdresser's suggestion. When my hair was an inch long, it wasn't hard to fight my hair type. Now that I'm in the process of growing it out, my hair has been pretty annoyed at the contant blow drying, dying, and straightening I have subjected it to. Regardless of the cut, my hair has been limp and fried. After using this product along with Big shampoo, my hair has been absolutely transformed. People have commented on my hair ever since I have started using these wonderful products. Now to the issue of price: before using Lush, I was using bumble and bumble wich goes for 20 bucks a pop, as well as various styling products that ran in the similar price range... since using Lush, I have no need for styling products, therefore making these purchases very economical. I can't say enough great things about this brand	pos

I am an experienced computer user, and I bought this primarily on my previous experince with Symantec products, which had been good.  My experience with this product was unfortunately, very poor. ---  --- First - the product claims to be able to clone your boot partition, but this failed repeatedly, creating cloned partitions which were not bootable.   ---  --- Second - Tech support failed to provide an answer for days while I eventually figured out myself that I needed to use the bootable media to make a clone of my system disk - something the windows application was happy to try and fail at without warning.  Even when I attempted to provide this information to tech support so they could answer similar questions for others, they didn't get what I was saying and sent me another form letter response detailing how to make a copy (instructions which failed of course). ---  --- Third - On another occasion, even using the bootable media, I got the error "1517" when attempting to clone by boot partition.  Searching the web revealed others having this problem, and Symantec tech support full of bogus solutions for it. ---  --- Fourth - no support for USB/Firewire drives with the bootable media. ---  --- On the plus side - it did resize partitions I asked it to without trouble (I give it one extra star for something working)	neg
Did not fit well AT ALL.  WAY too big around the ankles - every step I took, the boot would start to fall off.  They were the right size, length wise and all, just way too wide above my ankle.  They were about half as tall as they looked in the photo, which was very disappointing.  I sent the boot back at my own expense the same day.  I would definatly recommend finding a boot you like in the store so you can try it on first, then ordering it off of here for cheaper. 	neg

We got this toybox for our daughter when she turned one.  We love that it doesn't have any sharp corners or hinges to get fingers stuck inside.  It still looks like new 6 month later so it is very durable. If your child likes to get inside it like ours does there is no worry about them breaking it since the bottom is fabric.  We also really like the pockets in front for storing smaller items- we always stick her favorite dolls and animals in there.  We don't use the cover so that she can get the toys herself and it works perfect for us.  Highly recommend! 	pos

The no-name comedians at the beginning were funny, Bea Arthur killed, and the dumpy lady at the end who kept talking about how African-Americans used to dig her backside but don't any longer was funny. Courtney Love's antics were amusing but grew tiresome. The rest of the roast was horrible. Telling Tommy Lee that his genitals are the envy of barnyard animals is not an insult. And, after it's repeated ad nauseum, it's not funny either. ---  --- Has Andy Dick ever been funny? Kimmel? Corolla? Sarah Silverman? Spade post-Farley?

I used this product this morning for the first time.  I washed my hair, blew it dry, most of the way, then rubbed the product in my hands and lightly distributed it throughout my hair.  The best way for me to describe it, is that, it is like a creamy hairspray.  Yes, it is tacky, like hairspray can be, but that's how it helps you get the style you want.  What I like about how it works on my hair, is that it really tamed the frizzes and brought down the "big" hair look that I usually have after blowing my thick hair dry.  I think it would also work well on the days that I blow my hair out.  I would probably blow it out first, then apply some dirt to help tame and smooth it.  I can see where it might make thinner, straighter hair a bit limp, so be careful not to use very much. ---  --- Edit:  I think it is best to apply to slightly damp hair, that might help with the people that are having trouble applying it to completely dry hair	pos
I didn't like the only other Dean Koontz book I've ever read, Watchers, but I enjoy reading Kevin Anderson's stuff so I thought I'd give Koontz another try because I'm a reasonable person and I understand that not everyone can like everything by an author.  On to the review:  I realize that this book was initially meant to be a screenplay but I think the authors would have been wise to rewrite it instead of just tweaking it a little when the movie deal fell through.  The dialog is mind-numbing and predictable.  Every time there was a car scene I could guess what kind of conversation would be held.  "You drive too fast!"  "Are you my mother?"  Over and over and over.   ---  --- The idea was good.  A modern-day Frankenstein . . . or rather a Frankenstein that had never died and had made it to present day (yes, I know, Frankenstein was the doctor, not his monster.  But you get what I'm saying.).  But the dialog read exactly like a movie script would, or like a play.  This book had so much potential but the authors' laziness in not rewriting the entire thing after the movie wasn't made cost it dearly	neg
I found the mitt to be too stiff to be of any real use.  You can't really pick up or handle any utensils with the mit on.  You can move hot plates, etc. but you can't really carry anything with the mitt on.  Not worth the money albeit not very expensive.	neg

The scent of this tea brewing is a real wake-me-up.  Cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and orange peel are some of the very redolant flavors.  The cinnamon is so strong that it gives a slight burning  feeling in the mouth--one of my favorite things about this tea.  I'm not a huge tea drinker, but I really enjoy this in winter.  It's great for mulling things as well--apples, pears, and wine.  My only complaint is that it is not 100% reliant on chopped ingredients and there are some flavors added.  But it's still incredibly good and nice for a thoughtful morning or evening.  Makes me miss Seattle, WA and Pike Place Market	pos

I remember the next day at school and the next month after that performance we had all kind of talent shows where all of the kids were trying to out moonwalk each other. The saddest and funniest part was watching the less fortunate kids who could not afford the Michael gear wearing tube socks with dress shoes and kids making home made glitter and rhinestone gloves. Hilarious. As an adult, I refuse to let the media and even Michael himself ruin my childhood memories of this untouchable piece of music. ---  --- 24 years later Thriller remains the album to beat	pos

I was first introduced to the symphonic power metallers formerly known as Rhapsody (name changed due to copyright issues) on their 2006 live album Live in Canada. I have to say that I am just not that impressed or entertained by their latest studio effort. The group tends to rely more or the theatrical elements rather than focusing on their metal music. The vocals tend to be oversung, or drowned out by the chaos in the background. Rather than enhancing your metal experience with musical theatrical elements, Rhapsody of Fire puts you to sleep with them. The group does stay true to their fantasy themes however	neg

If this man took a the time to know the history of U.S. involvment in Panama he would know that it was the U.S. that put Noriega in power in the first place.it was also the U.S. that killed the previouse leader of Panama,Omar TorriJos.Who apposed U.S. control of his county. ---  The united states has used Panama for its own gains without regard for the freedom or rights of the Panamanian people since the take over of the country by President Roosevelt in 1903. --- One of many good books about the truth of Panamanian History is by John Perkins "Confessions of an Economic Hitman"	neg
This is a simple drawing program, much like Paint. Don't be mislead by the colored picture on the cover, it only does black and white. And it has no help in drawing Manga figures.

Save your money, this program isn't worth buying	neg
One whiff of this delicious soap and you are transported to a land of pine trees where plates of freshly sliced oranges are served on a bed of lemongrass, surrounded by patchouli candles. This is the best way I can describe the scent that seems to awaken from the night and mingle with memories of exotic honey and wide-open skies. I am not sure where I go when I inhale deeply, but I am no longer in the shower. Follow this with the Skin Sin lotion and you will enter a little bit of heaven on earth. Also delicious to use in a bath with sea salts and patchouli, orange slices optional, but you might crave the taste of oranges while using this soap.  ---  --- ~The Rebecca Review 	pos
I used to sell Iman when it was in a major department store.  This stuff would fly off the shelves.  Too bad it was hardly ever in stock which made many customers go to something else.  I stuck with it for 10 years now and would not dare use anything else!  Buy it - you will not be disappointed	pos

As others have mentioned, the front window blanks out almost immediately, and even worse, it doesn't show your missed calls.  You have to open the phone.  Stupid design.  It does not have any exterior lights, such as my old Samsung, that showed when it was charging, when charge completed, when a voice mail was waiting, etc.  This phone needs to be opened to get any info.  Can't even see the time without opening phone. ---  --- While talking on phone it blacks out after about 1 minute.  I don't like that either.  It's also very hard to hear on it.  Especially if in car, with traffic noise.  No, I'm not driving, but I'm a passenger trying to use my phone.  Forget it. ---  --- Re the color that someone mentioned.  Cingular is a light pastel pink, TMobile is magenta (dark pink).  The one thing I like is that this phone is a quad band, and if you travel interationally, it will be great.  I just got the phone, so haven't used it interational yet.  Oh, it must TMobile to get international service.   ---  --- The phone has a camera, plus other tech features, but I don't use them.  I want my phone only to be a phone, no other gadgets. ---  --- I would never buy this phone again, and as soon as I'm eligible for an upgrade this phone is history.  I doubt I would get a  Motorola ever again, I'll stick to Samsung.	neg
This has been a great addition to my truck - a useful compass and outside thermometer without going to the expense of a navigation system (and without having to learn another techno-gadget).

As he did with "Parade", the soundtrack to his last vanity project "Under the Cherry Moon", Prince provides a musically invigorating soundtrack to "Graffiti Bridge", which is a hopelessly silly film. No matter. "Graffiti Bridge", Prince's first album of the 90's, is also one of Prince's best albums of the 90's. ---  --- "New Power Generation" serves as the title track to Prince's new band, and it's a powerful, funky manifesto. "The Question of U" is exotic and intoxicating. "Elephants and Flowers" is an upbeat song about spiritual redemption, whereas "Tick Tick Bang" is Prince at his most joyously raunchy. Although most of Prince's material is exceptionally strong here, the collaborations and contributions by other artists are a mixed bag. "We Can Funk" is a simmering duet between Prince and funkmaster George Clinton, and Tevin Campbell provides some youthful exuberance to "Round and Round". But the tracks by The Time mostly fall flat. I've personally always found Morris Day to be a one-trick pony with his effete pimp routine, and his one trick gets boring quickly. ---  --- It's obvious that with "Graffiti Bridge" Prince is trying to create the feel and atmosphere of a funky block party. But I can't help but wonder, without the tracks featuring other artists, if "Graffiti Bridge" wouldn't be more highly regarded as one of Prince's better albums	pos

I purchased two chairs at first to test out the quality.  I had been looking for a Wrought Iron patio set but I didn't want to pay the high prices I was finding.  I really liked the chairs so I went ahead and ordered the WHOLE set!  2 loungers, love set, sofa, coffee table, side tables, and 2 more chairs.  Honestly, I love the set!  It's not your best quality but for the price I'm more then satisfied.  They are heavy pieces but not so heavy you can't move them around.  I had an issue with the sofa so I filled out the online return form and I'm telling you I have NEVER experienced the service I have received from Amazon.  They processed a new order at NO COST TO ME and they will pick up the defective one when they deliver the new one.  How great is that.  Even Costco makes you purchase the new item first and then they will credit you once they receive the old item back!  I order a lot online and I have to say Amazon has a great system	pos

Great company - Terrible toy.  My daughter got this toy for Christmas and waited all day for daddy to bring home the 4 C batteries which were not included.  She was excited until we turned it on.  1) the frame is not secure and will open when you reach into the middle to change the picture disk.  2) the light is not very bright and will not work in mid-day light. 3) the image is quite small - only takes up the middle 3 inches of the paper - not even close to what is pictured on the box.  4) the clamps that hold the paper are not easy for tiny fingers to use.  5) because the small picture is in the middle of the page and the clamps are on the far edges, you can't shift the paper to re-use the paper.  You get one tiny picture in the middle of standard size piece of paper and its a waste.   ---  --- The chalk board was fine - but the whole piece slides across the table when you push to draw.  Big disappointment. ---  --- Get some washable markers and some tracing paper and don't waste your money on this suprisingly junky toy	neg
This has to be the best of the Alien films! This film, although not as scary as the original (I mean that it did not scare me as much as Alien), it is much more exciting and enjoyable than the first.

Twinings was founded in London, England in 1706, and has a long and respected tradition of producing only the finest of teas. The history of Darjeeling tea goes back to the 1840s, when Dr. Campbell, a civil engineer, planted tea seeds in his garden at Beechwood, Darjeeling. The result was a nice light tea with excellent color and aroma. Darjeeling tea gained a considerable following, and is now highly prized as the "champagne of teas!" ---  --- OK, let's get down to brass tacks - this is an excellent tea, produced by a great company, and a tea I will NEVER be without. The tea has an excellent aroma and flavor and is harder to over-steep than some other teas that I have known. Also, something of a surprise is the fact that this tea tastes at least as good iced as it does hot! As such, year round you will find me making Twinings' Darjeeling tea. ---  --- So, here's the bottom line: if you want a tea that is excellent hot AND cold, then Darjeeling is for you. If you want tea from a great tea producer, then Twinings is for you. If you want the best tea in the world, then buy Twinings' Darjeeling tea	pos

Let me start by saying I think the regular Guru energy drink is the best on the market. I only wish I could say the same about GURU Lite. There is nothing positive about this drink. It is awful! I was very excited about trying the Lite version but after my first can the rest went straight into the garbage. You might as well take a Ginseng or Ginkgo Biloba capsule open it and pour it straight into your mouth.

I bought this to play back old Hi8 tapes so I could transfer them to DVD. However, there is no S-Video out and no stereo out. Video quality was bad: output was noisey and reds were over saturated.

There are some cheaper used options available, e.g. Sony EVO-250	neg

Having lived in what I consider the coffee capitol of the United States, Portland, I am confident in my personal assertion that Torrefazione Italia was the finest coffee shop out there. The environment was warm and exotic while the coffee was second to none, poured by authentic baristas.

Give them a try and I bet you won't go back to whatever it is that you are drinking now.	pos

Normally I am a big fan of the little tikes name, but not so with this product.  I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old daughter and although the concept is cute, it is not like other Little Tikes products.   To begin with, the train frequently comes off the track.  Also to activate it, you must press the button where the conductor goes.  However, it is difficult for my daughter to place the figure on this spot without it falling off.  She often presses the button in the process which activates the train while she is still trying to put the figure on it which frustrates her.  Since this is geared for toddlers, you would think that Little Tikes would have put the button to activate the motion in a different spot from where the figures go.  Also, at age 2 1/2 she is quickly bored with it.  She has more fun letting it go on the floor across the room than riding on the track.  Needless to say, it is going back.  The only good feature is that you can "pack it and go" for away from home fun	neg
This is my first review but I just felt compelled to tell everyone about this terrific program. I bought this game when my children were in Kindergarten and second grade. Fritz and Chester's program is so engaging. There are rhymes and chants for each piece's moves as well as for some other "strategy-type" moves. For example, "A knight on the rim is ugly and dim." What a great way to teach kids to keep their knights in-play! This program teaches kids how pieces move and some simple strategies. I would recommend getting Fritz and Chester 2 now since you are going to get it after your kids learn to play! My boys both joined chess teams when they were in first and third grade. Their use of this computer game gave them the advantage to win several chess games in tournaments. Fritz and Chester 2 is also great and my boys, now in third and sixth grade, still play it	pos
I've had one of these for 13 years.  ONE.  For THIRTEEN years.  It still works great. ---  --- PLEASE use it carefully, if you're going to use it.

To completely avoid that, and any similar problems you'll need Dr. Sonnon... but in the meantime, just be careful	pos
My 9 year old son loves Dragon Mountain.  He wasn't able to assemble it alone; eventhough he's typically very good at assembling most other toys.  It took about an hour for him and his dad to assemble it...but he felt it was more than worth the time it took to put it together	pos
The Big Bubbler is the greatest bubble wand----we have had consistently huge bubbles with the top-of-the-line/expensive bubble solution, as well as, the cheapest $1.99 jugs.  The only thing that didn't work at all for us was straight dish detergent (hey, we were desperate).  My youngest toddler will chase the bubbles endlessly, and even a neighbor's preteen son couldn't resist chasing the large bubbles across our yard.  I also like that I am playing WITH the kids when I make the bubbles for them vs. simply turning on a battery-operated machine and then standing back.  ---  --- If I had to gripe, it would only be to say that I wish the top of the wand (the end that holds the bubble solution) could be stood on end.  It is hard for the little ones to keep the top from spilling while waving the wand; it is also tough for them to get the wand back into the top to get more bubble solution. ---  --- We also go through a LOT of solution---I plan to buy a few large jugs of it to have it on hand.  But, this seems like a minor inconvenience given how much fun we have all had watching the bubbles dance all over our yard	pos
I really like the Speedo suit.  I wear two swim suits, the Speedo and a larger "drag" suit over it.  I've done this since my days on the swim team.  The chlorine in the water tends to weaken the seams on my suit over time, causing the drag suit to self-destruct eventually.  Having the Speedo prevents any embarrassing moments.  The fit and material is good and it holds up very well - this is the first replacement I've needed in years.   ---  --- If you are husky, this might be a tight fit.  I wear a 42-44 pant size and this is on the snug side. 	pos

Nothing in this book was usable for me.  Okay, very little.  If I was trying to write the next _Ethan Frome_, then this book would be perfect.  Instead I write sci-fi and fantasy.  I was looking for tips to improve my description of things; this book recommends describing different things.  Too much emphasis on metaphor (which is a wonderful tool but a tad obvious).  If you want to write in a way people might actually communicate, this book might be a waste of your time.  HOWEVER, poets and pure-literary writers might find it more useful than I did	neg

Both this game and Danger by Design were disappointing compared to some of the previous games (Shadow Ranch, the Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon, Secret of the Old Clock, etc.).

Hopefully Her Interactive will produce something better next time, because these games really are addictive, even for adults	neg
Juggernaut was more or less lumped in with the disaster movie genre when it came out in the mid-70s, possibly because the making of the film itself seemed so disastrous. Originally a Bryan Forbes film, Forbes was briefly replaced by Don Medford (who had also briefly taken over The Guns of Navarone after Alexander MacKendrick was fired and before J. Lee Thompson was hired) before Richard Lester took over. While it's easy to spot some of the typical Lester touches (such as poor offscreen jokes added during the dubbing sessions), it's so unlike most of his other films that you constantly find yourself wondering who directed what. ---  --- Regardless of where the credit lies, the end result is a terrific thriller, with Richard Harris' bomb disposal team parachuted to Omar Sharif's liner with several bombs aboard while Anthony Hopkins tries to track down the extortionist in London. The bomb disposal scenes are genuinely tense, the characterisation surprisingly strong enough to undercut potential clich?s and Alan Plater's dialog quite superb, with the film offering both the required suspense and a neat little state-of-the-nation address of Britain in the early 70s. Really rather terrific.	pos

Now, I'm a pretty picky guy when it comes to certain things in life and one of those items just happens to be Backpacks. I spent about two months searching for a new one until I finally came across this particular model. I'll start with by saying that I love this damn thing. It has plenty of space, a whole bunch of extra cords that I suppose a hiker would use but I think just look nice, and its very durable (which is a must for me since everything I own will take a beating). I'm telling you straight from the horse's mouth, this Backpack is worth the money. Now if it only came as an 18 slot..	pos
Since the storylines of this fourteen-year-old film must surely be well-known, let me say that The Piano, one of my favorite movies, is a unique production whose makers went out of their way to truly give it the appearance of the mid-nineteenth-century. It strolls forward with an anti-modern slowness in order to accentuate the unspoiled scenery of New Zealand, and successfully bring certain moments to prominence with a pace that matches that of the pre-electronic era in which it is set. The quality of the visuals is heightened by the performances given by Holly Hunter, Sam Neill, Harvey Keitel, and most especially Anna Paquin, whose skillful portrayal here won her an Oscar at the tender age of eleven. The plot of The Piano is highly unusual, even unique. For filmmakers to have accomplished the release of a tale concerning a woman of the 1800's, who went from Scotland to the most remote of British colonies in order to marry a stranger, for this woman to be one whose self-imposed muteness is compensated by her lovely playing of a piano...I'm daunted by the courage of those who brought The Piano into reality. For the wealth of feeling in its story, for its setting, for its cast and for its sheer brave inimitability, it is a fine motion picture	pos
The shade I use is Subtle Lips. I love it! It gives some color but not so much that I feel done up. I could be in complete casual clothes and throw it on and feel great. And yet it looks great on Sundays too. Because of the mild color it matches everthing. And unlike lip gloss, it's not sticky at all. (I can't tolerate any stickiness!) I am only somewhat picky about scent and taste, and to me this one has neither. I think it is by far worth the $20!!	pos
Tina Dirmann did a fantastic job writing about this difficult case, which encompasses motherhood, mental illness, child abuse, and matricide. Dirmann does not interject her own biases or agenda into her writing, rather she presents the many different angles of this story in a compassionate fashion. That, in and of itself is impressive, because many writers of true crime tend to lean one side or the other,get caught up in emotion, and appear unable to really present all sides of the story. Lessons can be learned from this book regarding mental illness and society's responsibility to help families who are in need of intervention. It is so sad that the extended families of these boys failed not only them, but also tragically failed their mother.	pos

Whereas the body glove cosmetically looks good, it has a diabolical flaw inherent in its POOR design. The attachment button that is mounted on the rear of the glove that allows quick engagement and disengagement to the belt clip is seriously defective. The plastic button resides in a small pocket sewn into the rear of the glove. The problem is that the button flange that holds the button connector to the glove is floating inside of the rubber elastic glove. The pocket stretches! As soon as any pressure is applied to the phone when it is hanging on your belt (like when you sit down or bump anything), the connector easily (and silently) dislodges from its elastic pocket!!! Your valuable cell phone drops to the ground and you have lost it! You have lost your phone but the button is still attached to your belt clip. This is a dreadfully constructed device that the designer should be ashamed of. Use this glove at your own peril	neg
I was looking for a cd that I could listen to all of the time.  Oh my God, I am breathless.  I was brought to tears as they sang "Mama".

Think twice before purchase: --- 1. Most of the good tracks are available on the non-copy protected "All-Time Top 100 TV Themes", along with the best themes from other networks. --- 2. This disc has CDS-100 copy protection, so you probably can't upload to Windows Media and definitely not to iTunes. --- I could not upload from my internal CD drive, only from an external multi-format CD/DVD burner. It still only uploaded to Windows Media, not iTunes. --- To get into iTunes, I had to add the WMA files and then convert them to MP3. --- This probably caused some quality loss as I'm converting one compressed format to another compressed format! --- A time-consuming and tedious process which could have been avoided altogether if music companies would get over this fixation on "controlling" everything. --- Hello record execs: If nobody can add your discs to their libraries, guess what happens? They DON'T PLAY YOUR MUSIC!!! --- You might think you're protecting your valuable investment, but you're shooting yourself in the foot instead. Here's how it goes: --- 1.

Nobody buys your music. --- Remember, this only loaded from a particular kind of drive, so it may or may not work on yours. --- As Bela Lugosi would say: Bevare	neg
i bought this stuff trying to save a few bucks b/c it claims to be better than proactiv. after using proactiv for a month, then trying this stuff, acnefree doesn't compare to proactiv. granted, this is better than a bar of soap, but it's definately worth spending the extra $20 to get proactiv.	neg

This is my first experience with HDTV and wide screen.  This 46" Sony TV is excellent with HD programs; with regular broadcasts, it is a bit muddy, but that is the fault of the signal, not the TV.  I am very pleased with the overall quality of the set.  I had the set professionally installed and set up, and I am sure glad I did: install and set up are not for amateurs like me; if anything ever happens, I will be hard pressed to reset things.  Sony's instruction manuals are not that great	pos
I've only had this watch for about a week, so can't really comment about the long term durability.  However, it is ultra cool watch. ---  --- Although I've not got a scale handy at the moment, but it seems to be lighter than my iPod Nano.  Really a featherweight watch, and therefore very comfortable to wear.   ---  --- The dial color really can't be adaquately captured in a picture.  It is VERY attractive, much more striking than the image indicates.  Several people have asked where I purchased it. ---  --- I'm very happy with this choice	pos
Quite frankly this is the only cooking magazine I have ever subscribed to that I actually have looked forward to using and to receiving every two months. I like it so much I am writing my first Amazon review! The format of the magazine makes it easy to follow the recipes - they are always printed on two pages across from each other - and unlike some of the other posters I prefer the black and white format so that the paper is thicker and doesn't tear easily. Having tear away ads (for their own products) on the outside of the magazine means that the usable portion doesn't take up much space on my shelf.  ---  --- The recipes are easy to follow and usually clear. When they include specialized ingredients there is usually also a substitution listed. Their product reviews are terrific - I wish I hadn't wasted so many dinners on bad whole wheat pasta. My only gripe, as someone who does not have a dishwasher, is the great number of bowls and kitchen tools the recipes require. ---  --- I have made at least half the recipes from the magazines, many several times, which is no small feat for a "flexitarian" who never has meat as a main dish.	pos
If rating a "no star" was possible, that's what it really deserves.  I bought this for my two year old twin boys and as I was inflating it - with a handpump - it blew at the seams!  Beyond patching!  Unfortunately they never even knew that they had it.  I would not buy it again because of the quality of the product.  How can kids be safe jumping on something that blows out when being pumped by a hand pump???  That's like blowing it up by mouth! 	neg

I purchased this bike from a local dealer 15 months ago and it has broken down 3 times in the last 15 months. The resistence motor is defective which is what I have had replaced 3 times now. This motor does not allow you to change gears or bike through a program--upgrading to shifiting on the fly technology would be a plus.  --- The positive aspect of the bike is the comfort and grip heart rate monitor and the ability to swap out saddles also a plus. Ovewrall I cannot recommend this product.	neg
We are using this series of CDs in our homeschool music program - they are fantastic!   We especially love this one about Bach - what an awesome man!   The story of his life is told in a way that is very interesting and holds the children's attention while also using various pieces of his music in the narration.  It is done VERY well!   My children are gaining a tremendous amount of knowlege and appreciation for music through this CD and so are my husband and I	pos
After receiving, putting together and using this toy with myself and children, I overestimated what it would be.  I remember the old school Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots, and this product isn't even close.  The old characters stood 6-8" tall and both necks sprung up with metal parts when a blow to the head was delivered.  This version has only plastic parts, the characters are 4" tall at best, and the 'win' is from a blow to the chest, not the head.  Metallo's head springs up, but Superman's head only nods backward.  It is difficult to discern the 'winner' from the set up.  It was only an $11 lesson for me to learn, but if you truly want a real Rock 'em set, try eBay, or yard sales.  This replica is not comparable to the original	neg

I lived in Seattle for almost 20 years.  However, in all that time, and even going down to the Pike Place Market at least 2 or 3 times a year (we lived far east of town), I never "knowingly" drank MarketSpice Tea.  However, we moved to North Carolina and "discovered" this wonderful drink.  We also became avid tea drinkers.  A good part of that conversion, was due to MarketSpice Tea. ---  --- The flavors are spicey, pungent, smack you up side the head intense.  If you like Lipton, you won't like this.  We use the loose tea only.  Yes, it's a little more of a hassle compared to tea bags, but worth it due to the freshness, flavor, etc. ---  --- Also, until the our last purchase, which was from Amazon, we always ordered from MarketSpice themselves.  They're great people, they always shipped what I wanted, etc.  I'll never buy from them directly again.  They don't want to move into the 21st Century when it concerns automation and I respect that.  However, I have.  Amazon gives me the capability to do both; order my favorite tea and do so online, with a company that remembers my address, credit card, etc. ---  --- I can wholeheartdly recommend this product and ordering through Amazon.  If you like tea, you owe it to yourself to try this product.	pos

As a frequent reader of home design books and magazines, the title and the beautiful cover of this book immediately appealed to me.  A quick review of the table of contents revealed that I had to have this book.  Pelosi begins with the basics, moves into specifics, and then focuses on those special challenges we all face when trying to make our homes beautiful and appealing without spending a fortune. The pictures are gorgeous and inspiring and the author has an ability to write clearly and concisely with a great sense of humor. Whether you are looking for a single design solution or, like me, enjoy reading about interior design, this is the book for you...and it makes a great gift for your friends and family and colleagues and anyone who lives in a home.  "Interior Divine" made my holiday shopping easier this year!	pos
I have been a Barry Manilow fan since I was a teenager.  I have NEVER been disappointed with any of his work and this CD is no exception!

This watch is beautiful.  I cannot say enough good things about this watchs design.  Its 45mm face is bigger than most watches but doesnt look gawdy, it keeps perfect time and is very light weight.  I bought the Calibre 8700 before this one and I love both of them but I would give this one a slight edge.  My two small complaints are that this watch doesnt have the perpetual calender which is a very nice feature that the Calibre 8700 does have, and also that this watch uses mineral crystal for the face and not Saphire.  I am sure the crystal used is scratch resistant but it is no where near as resistant as Saphire crystal would be	pos

Actually haven't heard this CD, yet, I can still comment on part of it. I was the lucky guy who did the live recording at the X-Ray Cafe.   Sold the masters to the band a couple years ago and just now got around to thinking, "I wonder if they ever did anything with those masters?" ---  --- So, I was there at the show and can say that every ounce of energy that the band put out (which was considerable since this was the last show on their tour,  but they knew the X-Ray was special and gave it their all)- It was all captured on these recordings.   ---  --- The machine was a Tascam 688 that used standard cassette tapes for 8-channel recordings. Most all the mics were either Shure SM57/58, but there was also a high quality Shure stereo mic overhead that was mainly used for capturing the drum kit but also provided a nice stereo image of the stage.   ---  --- The X-Ray was perfect for this type of recording. The tiny PA was only used for the vocals, so, there was no competing with a PA blasting everything.  I would place a SM-57 close to every amp.  Had a nice specialtiy bass mic, too.  Usually, 8 channels was enough to catch everything, but, there were extra inputs where it was possible to stack multiple mics onto a single track if needed. Because of the overhead stereo catching the drums, this was rarely needed. ---  --- With a full house, such as the night with The Gits, any reflecting waves were just soaked up by the body mass of the crowd, creating what turned out to be a very nice intimate recording space.  There was split box on stage which fed all the mics to the X-Ray "business office" next door, which is where the Tascam was setup away from any real danger.  All of which made it a fun gig to record in comfort and be able to also go over to the stage side and enjoy the show.  Every once in a while, magic happened. --- D. Fletcher --- Portland, OR	pos

i hate to write a bad review- i think it's actually the first one i've ever written. this was a gift from my husband's work christmas party for our 2-year old. the extension on the pole is a stiff plastic piece and doesn't stay extended so that you can catch the fish; it folds back on itself. so our son wasn't able to catch anything with it. it would be better if the extension didn't bend at all, but just stayed in one place, and even if it did that i wouldn't buy it. it's more fun to have a pole with a string so you can reel it in	neg

I read the various reviews about the movie "The Hunter".  I was surprised at the extremeties in preference.  Much like owning a Fiero,  . . . . which I do. ---  --- The movie, as is the Fiero, is overall slower than most of McQueen's.  However, he still pulls it off, showing his great acting ability.  When you take the character, "Papa" Thorson,  he was a different breed in the wrong time era.  Who else, but McQueen could make him so realistic? ---  --- I haven't seen the movie in several years. I have been wanting a copy to add to my library.  I intend to do that today. ---  --- Oh yeah, the relationship between the movie and the Fiero?  I have found that there are those that either dearly love it or wish they had never laid eyes on it.  I loved "The Hunter" and I love my Fiero.  For those of you who don't understand, . . . "sorry"!  Steve McQuen displayed more of his talent, even while ill.   God bless you, Steve and thank you for the entertainment you gave us	pos

I agree with other reviewers that the graphics and vocals are good, but I find the gameplay itself less than stellar. For starters, I've always been irritated with games that don't let you save your status whenever you want. Sometimes I just want to get in a quick dose of gameplay, but that's not possible with these games that require you to play through an entire section before being allowed to save.  That contributes to the repetitive, tedious nature of some sections. If you get stuck getting through a certain bit of the game, you're doomed to replay much of what led up to it over and over again. ---  --- I realize that tricky camera angles are some of the challenges that are supposed to exist in this game. More than in the earlier versions, however, I have trouble getting myself lined up for whatever task. Another tedious element. ---  --- I found this game to be more a test of my endurance and patience than actual fun	neg
This diaper bag is a great urban carrier for baby items and can easily pass off as a regular messenger bag for every day use.  ---  --- * It's functional and has multiple organizers, including a place for your cell phone, keys, and a zippered insulated compartment for baby's bottle or a toddler's drink. ---  --- * For parents, there are two inside pockets with zippers that are perfect for wallets and other small items.

The design is trendy without having an appearance that will become easily outdated. ---  --- * After nearly two years of daily use, it's still in good condition and shows little signs of wear.  ---  --- * It's also a very convenient on-the-go type bag that stays put when you're out and about	pos
As a library administrator I get to see and read an awful lot of woodworking books and magazines.  I have been a personal subscriber to Woodworker's Journal for a year now, and an off and on reader of the magazine for about 5 years.  In that time I have grown to appreciate this as a very good woodworking magazine.  Is it my favorite?  No, but I still like it well enough to recommend it to others.  I also regularly read Fine Woodworking, Workbench, Wood, Popular Woodworking, etc. and like all of those, this magazine has its strengths.  I find that WJ is very into power tools, tool reviews (theirs are among my favorites), and shop projects.  Having said all of that, I also must confess that the best piece of furniture I ever built came from a plan in WJ magazine (an arts & crafts style wine storage table), so don't pigeon-hole it too much. ---  --- Try it for a year and I bet you won't be sorry! ---  ---     	pos

I've been frustrated for quite some time now with having Adobe Reader and expecting it should do what Adobe Acrobat can do.  I was especially interested in creating PDF's (Portable Document Formats)of Word documents.  Although I have Photoshop that can do this for me in a roundabout way, I wasn't satisfied with the extra time it took to do so.  Faced with the assignment of pulling together a rather large family cookbook, aptly named, "Death by Cholesterol", I felt justified in finally purchasing not only "Acrobat" but also "OmniPage", an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software.  With these programs in hand it made the project fun to do.  Now I have the whole cookbook with its index as a sinle multi-page PDF file that can be read and also printed out by anyone I care to send it to over the Internet.  It's of great value to me now and gives me enhanced versatility even though I've only used a small part of its capabilities.  The reason that I've only given it a "4" rating?  I'm upset that I didn't get the full version, but I can't justify doing so.  I'm being petulant	pos

This is the book many others attempt to duplicate but simply cannot. In addition to the cool little features like elastic band (keeps book closed when stuffed full of other found items & papers), the pocket in the back and the durable cover this is a very well made book. As a student of book making, this is a classic piece. Most books nowadays are a form of "perfect binding" where the pages are just glued on the spine. Needless to say this is as non-archival and non-durable as it gets. Moleskine's are done they classic way: pages folded and sewn together in signatures then sewn to the binding. They will last forever, which is why we still have sketchbooks around from the likes of Van Gogh, etc. ---  --- An overall great choice, I recommend it constantly	pos

Not that I know everything about crime - especially getting away with it - but A SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM made it look too easy. Performances by Michael Caine as a done-wrong-now-doin'-wrong angry executive and Will Patton as  the police detective who is wise to him make the film worth a look on  television.  But A SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM needed to close a few holes in its  story to make it worthy of your movie theater/home video payment	neg
I subscribed to Cooks Magazine some years ago, back when it  began publishing again.  I had problems with issues that failed to arrive, and wrote to them about it - never received a reply or any note of concern. ---  --- Since that time, I occasionally glance through it at newsstands to see if there are any articles of interest.  Even by dint of casual glance, I've begun to tire of the formulaic articles in which some drone tirelessly adds or deletes ingredients in order to finally come up with the "perfect recipe" for something or other.  I now skip right to the "perfected" recipe, and decide whether its worth committing to memory.  Some of the explanations for the success or lack thereof of the inclusion or exclusion of a particular ingredient are hare-brained at best. ---  --- There are also two other areas of this magazine that have disappointed me: ---  --- 1.  Product Reviews:  They range from just plain wrong to idiotic. ---  --- The KitchenAid Pro 600 was hailed by Cook's as the best in its class for many mixing chores.  Yet, the Amazon reviews tell a different tale - one of a short lifespan when used to mix bread dough because of a plastic gear cover that deforms and finally comes apart, allowing the metal gears to separate. ---  --- Christopher Kimball (the editor) once performed an evaluation of cookware in which he calculated the price of the cookware per pound of its weight.  No, I'm not joking.  In that evaluation, Le Creuset came out on top simply because it was heavy.  All-Clad, even though it conducts heat very evenly, suffered for not having as much heft, and therefore was judged pricey, on a pound weight basis. ---  --- One issue of Cooks boasted on its cover "Unsweetened chocolate -supermarket brand beats others".  Apparently, Hershey's was designated best.  Not too many months later, Callebaut was recommended above all others, and Hershey's was judged barely acceptable.  Feeling manipulated yet? ---  --- 2.  Finally, there are those dreadful editorials by Mr. Kimball.  Rambling, painfully written, and punctuated with a picture of Mr. Kimball wearing a bow tie, and looking very much as if his head were being held on by it. Mr. Kimball is a humble man, with much to be humble about.  He writes as if he were chanelling Helen Gurley Brown, but in red and black flannel watch-plaid and without her sense of play.   ---  --- Time to re-vamp this magazine, folks	neg
I typically do not read stories like this, but a neighbor had lent it to me and I figured I'd check it out.  The plot isn't bad, but the dialogue is another story.  The writing was so unbelievably awful that I had to fight myself to finish it.  Phrases like "God damn, Oh god, etc..." were repeated over and over again. I got really sick hearing about Tess's cute freckles and Jimmy's movie star looks/sex drive.  The majority of the story line between Tess and Jimmy has them arguing over a one night stand.  It was 300 + pages of pretty bad writing.  I'd strongly recommend taking a pass on this book. Not worth your time unless you are looking to take a mini-break from Harlequin romances...	neg
This game I would recommend without reservation to anyone looking for an adventure game that is beautiful, positive, entrancing, funny, inventive, has a great soundtrack, and doesn't involve violence / carnage.  I'm 40 and was completely under the spell of the game for weeks and weeks.  My 6 year old son was equally engaged, and was able to complete about 40% of it without help, himself (he needed help with boss battles, or anything under time pressure). ---  --- You can lose hours to this game but you won't emerge with tense, sore shoulders from anxiety or frustration over impossible tasks.  At the same time, it is definately not too easy.  It's just challenging enough.  And it's long thank goodness, because I didn't want it to end!  The overall tone is so positive.  You get to be a Japanese wolf goddess romping through what is a detailed, beautifully imagined and executed Japanese watercolor world.  You have weapons and you do take out monsters, but your weapon is a ink brush, and you take out the monsters with calligraphy strokes.   ---  --- Simply brilliant, and would make an excellent Christmas gift for an adventure game lover	pos

Normally I wouldnt write a review, but I have had numerous experiences with this camera that I thought I would share. ---  --- My sister first bought the camera, and I was amazed with how user friendly it was and I thought the pictures turned out pretty well.  Shortly afterward, her screen blacked out, without any great impact or weather damage. ---  --- Naturally, I assumed it mustve gotten bumped in the wrong way, tough luck.  I then proceeded to buy one for myself, and a couple of months after I had it, my screen also inexplicably failed to work. ---  --- And then for Christmas, my sister received a replacement camera for her broken one, and yet again, shortly after purchase, the screen was broken. ---  --- I do accept some responsibility for the damage, I imagine that if it was in a purse in a bookbag, perhaps it got rattled around a bit.  But three times? I dont find this to be a coincidence, and I do not reccomend that you risk your money, because you too may have to replace it after 3 months	neg

There was a time when liberalism had a connotation of deep thinking, tolerance, and openness to healthy, civil debate. ---  --- No longer.  And HARPER'S is a perfect symbol for all that ails the Left.  To call this magazine "Left leaning" is a farce.  It doesn't lean...it completely, totally, enthusiastically, and blindly tumbles and falls into the "Far Left" swamp.  The tone is often hysterically and shrilly partisan, reflecting the ongoing deafness and disconnection that the leftist media elites have towards the mainstream of America.   ---  --- The quality of the writing and feature selection has declined precipitously through recent years.  This rag is about as credible now as THE GUARDIAN, NATIONAL ENQUIRER, or, come to think of it, The New York TIMES!  Save your money, LOL!	neg

I have been a reader of BusinessWeek for over 10 years.  I have noticed that it has had a significant change in focus over the last year.  While there are more articles on "Personal Business", the hard-core articles have gone the way of Newsweek, and U.S. News and World reports.  The nature of the articles are lightweight and do not reflect issues important to decision makers today. ---  --- Like many others, I have noticed a political slant or agenda over the last year.  Specifically, their commentaries and economic analysis trend to the left.  Bob Kuttner is co-editor of the American Prospect and contributor to the Boston Globe.  Every one of his articles begins with the premise that the President's policies are bad and then is followed by a tortuous rational for that thesis, to include discussion of the days of gold backed currency. ---  --- Andrea D'Andrea Tyson is better, but as a former Clinton advisor, is not objective in her analysis.  Alternative economic opinions are far and few between and what opinions they do tout, does not agree with the numbers stated in their own Figures of the Week. ---  --- While BW has the potential for great reporting based on their resources, they have let their editorial priorities get in the way of serious business reporting.  For serious Business readers and students, I recommend going to alternative sources. ---  --- And yes, I will let my subscription lapse this year.	neg
I tried Fisher-Price's Take-Along Jungle Swing then this Open Travel Swing. In both swings my baby would lean forward and fold himself in half in the seat. The Jungle swing was difficult to haul around since it didn't stay closed well and the "palm tree" was always in the way. Finally I bought the Fisher-Price Aquarium Swing. I found the seat of the Aquarium swing to be deeper and it clicks in place (so it won't fold over on baby) and it is easier to assemble and haul around.	neg
The Samsung A900 is a great phone - a Motorola Razr on steroids. (That is, it's much more durable than the Razr.)  ---  --- BUT THE BATTERY LIFE IS AWFUL!!!  You literally have to charge this phone at least two times per day to get any real talk time. ---  --- NOT ANY MORE!  The Bargaincell price was so low, I was skeptical.   PERISH THE THOUGHT!  I got the battery on time; it was VERY well packaged.  It fit the phone PERFECTLY, as did the COVER it came with. ---  --- I plugged it in and let it charge completely.  I then used the phone for THREE DAYS without a recharge!  WHOO HOO!!!!  BRAVO BARGAINCELL! ---  --- BY THE WAY - Even though this is a somewhat "thick" battery, it is  SURPRISINGLY UNOBTRUSIVE: It does NOT add the "bulk" you might think, looking at its picture.  In fact, I think the phone actually looks BETTER with the larger battery.  I have a leather Bytech carry case designed for the Razr/A900.  It's a tight fit now, but I'm sure the case will stretch much like a new shoe does after it's been worn a few days. ---  --- DO NOT HESITATE TO BUY ONE OF THESE BATTERIES!!	pos

I didn't encounter any problems with this product infact it was much easier to use and it allows you to combine and orginaze text files, chart spreadsheets, drawings, PDF documents and more into a single compressed package with advanced security features it also has many tools, overall this product was fantastic and I cannot recommend this highly enough. The interface and toolbars might be annoying but that is just a slight problem since it can be taken down and become more user friendly. The other reviewers who complained about this being slower need to know that this is just the standard edition which I use, there is a better edition which is The Professional Full Product of Adobe Acrobat 7.0 that also includes an upgrade.....	pos

This is an awesome movie! I think its better than Anchors Aweigh. Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra are two baseball players named Eddie O'Brien and Dennis Ryan who play for the Wolves. During the off-season Eddie and Dennis are vaudeville stars. When they return for the baseball season the whole team is horrifed to hear that the new owner K.C. Higgins wants to take an active part in coaching. As it turns out the K in K.C. Higgins happens to stand for Katherine (Esther Williams) so the new owner is a woman. Katherine dosn't fall for womanizer Eddie so the two don't get along at all!! Dennis does fall for her though, but Katherine isn't in love with him. Shirley Delwyn (Betty Garrett) has her eyes on Dennis and she won't give up on him! Also in the cast is Jules Munshin who plays Nat Goldberg, Dennis and Eddie's baseball pal.  ---  --- This movie has a lot of great music. --- The songs include "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" Frank and Gene sing this song as their vaudeville act. Also Williams sings this while swimming in the pool.  --- "Yes, Indeedy" The boys sing this song to the baseball team when they return from their vaudeville act. Its about their love life. --- "O'Brien to Ryan to Goldberg" Kelly, Sinatra, and Munshin sing this song! One of the best numbers! --- "The Right Girl for Me" Sinatra sings this song to Williams. --- "It's Fate, Baby"  Garrett sings this to Sinatra to prove that they were meant for each other.  --- "Strictly USA" Probabley the best number everyone sings this at a party. --- "Upon St. Patrick's Day" Kelly dances and sings to this great song. He sorta does this Irish gig. Kelly is truly the best dancer there ever was! This is one of the best numbers up there w/ Strictly USA. --- At the end Kelly, Sinatra, Williams, Garrett sing to Strictly USA as the finale. It really great! The dvd has the following special features which are 2 deleted numbers called "Baby Face" and "Boys and Girls Like You and Me". It also contains the trailers of Anchors Aweigh, On the Town, and the trailer for this movie. Also includes notes on Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly. For some odd reason I love this movie! This is a must see if you are a Kelly fan	pos
My first blackberry and I love it! I wanted to stop lugging around a phone AND a rather heavy Dell Axim just to have contacts, calendar and task-to-do list. I wanted a phone that synched with Outlook and was a great phone.  The Pearl is definitely the BEST choice.  I didn't really care about internet, music or camera, but the cheapest $30 internet plan from Cingular lets me have unlmited internet and access to home email instantly - it's just great!  I bought the $40 1Gb card and now have about 150 mp3 songs and pictures on it.  I use the mp3 songs as ringtones and it's GREAT to be able to instantly recognize who's calling from the music.  Camera is ok - not great, but ok and very nice to have for on-the-spot photos that you don't want to lug around the regular digital for.  I actually emailed a picture on the spot - very cool.  Battery life is phenomenal so far.  However, I'm not a heavy user and I used the profiles to have phone automatically shut off from 2am to 6am every day.  ---  --- Only cons so far are: 1) getting used to the keypad - believe what every one says about the intuitiveness of the keypad figuring out the correct word.  I've followed other folks' advice and don't really look at the words letter by letter - i type a sentence and then look - it works like a charm 9 times out of 10 that the keyboard correctly identifies each word.  Still, this type of entry is so different for a first time blackberry user, but getting used to this is still better than using a stylus and touch screen like the Axim. --- 2) Also having trouble with having to restart if I change a ringtone for someone - I have to reseat the battery to get the change to take effect.  Hmmm... --- 3) Volume when talking, even on speakerphone, is average - not terrible, but ok.  So far, my reception is fine. --- 4) I also wonder how long the track ball will last - I'm not a heavy user and I still use it constantly.  I think i'm going to buy the insurance plan just in case. ---  --- These minor cons are far outweighed by a simply GREAT phone that synchs with Outlook and so very much more.  Bye Bye Dell Axim.  It's true what some say - I'm a "crackberry" because playing with this thing is addictive. I'll update this review again in 3 months or so, but I don't anticipate any problems.  My only regret is I didn't hold out until a red Pearl came in stock at my local Cingular kiosk.  I would honestly give this phone 4.5 out 5 stars if they let you	pos

I personally have always enjoyed reading Time magazine long before I became politically aware. I started reading this magazine since I was in my adolescence.Do I think it is liberal biased as some of the other reviewers claims that it is? I don't know and I don't care. I don't read it from a particular point of view. Some of the cover stories in the past may be highly questionable given how shallow they might be but I don't take it personally. One of the best articles I have read in a long time is the issue on high school drop outs. I thought that was quite thought provoking. I didn't think much of the 100 most influential people in the world list. Katie Couric?! C'mon. That woman is to hard journalism as Paris Hilton is to music. I won't even get into Rachel Ray. If people think Time Magazine is too liberal, then go read the National Review. I don't see Time as hard journalism. Half the stuff they publish is fluff pieces.	pos

My son has been using this table for the last 3 months and absolutely loves it.  He also has the LeapFrog table, but gets bored with just one.  This table is on the opposite side of our (toy-filled) living room, and he will go over to this for a change of pace.  He loves Elmo and likes to hang on to his head and also mouth it.  He likes to use the phone, which he also mouths - just assume he puts his mouth on everything :) - and also the little bowl under Cookie Monster.  So why four stars and not five?  I do wish the base had a bit more weight to it, but he can easily pull up on it without getting the whole toy over although we've had a couple of near tips.  Also, the toy is a little less educational than I feel it could be since he is always accidentally setting off buttons with his arm...so he could be pressing the triangle with his finger, but his arm could press the Pig...and off Elmo goes oinking and singing about pigs.  Still a great toy, with lots of entertainment value, and as he matures we have less accidental set-offs.  I bought it on sale and it was worth the money	pos

It used to be (and it has been a couple years since I have bought a computer game new) that as long as your PC was not too old, you could run any game on it.  No so with Oblivion (and some other new games I believe).  To run Oblivion (as is) you need a machine with a high end graphics card.  So unless you bought a PC specifically for gaming, or specifically updated the graphics card, Oblivion will just quit after the intro screen, without telling you why!  While I readily accept that not having a high end graphics card will mean that games will not look as good, it is frustrating that this game will not even run on my PC (a dual core, with 1G of RAM).  And no, it still does not run if you install the manufacturer's patch. ---  --- However all is not completely lost.  I was able to install "Oldblivion" (just Google for it to find the site) and another patch from the Oldblivion site and now it runs acceptably.  With Oldblivion and the other patch the graphics are still pretty good (better than Morrowind though understandably not nearly as good as the screenshots online), however it tends to crash every so often (its unclear whether or not this is due to graphics incompatibilities or just other bugs in the game). ---  --- Nonetheless, if have a high end graphics card, or have the patience to apply all the unofficial online patches, the game is pretty cool.  I was not a big fan of Morrowind, but Oblivion has a number of improvements over Morrowind (in my opinion): ---  --- 1) You can fast travel (just open up a map and click) to all cities and any sites that you have been to before.  And even when you cannot fast travel to a new place, you can usually walk in a nearly straight line there (in Morrowind it was maddening to go someplace since I often would end up running into mountains that I could not climb) ---  --- 2) Oblivion is not so dark and gloomy, like Morrowind was! ---  --- 3) NPC speak (this to me is a huge benefit, in Morrowind they might utter some cryptic phrase when they saw you but then you would have to to through pages of text dialouge -- if I wanted to read I would pick up a book, not play a computer game!) ---  --- 4) There is a quest arrow that points towards the person you need to see.  In Morrowind it was incredibly tedious to track people down! ---  --- 5) And finally a minor point, the names of people do not look like the programmers mashed the hand on the keyboard (in Morrowind there were quests like "go see ERAJGUKADFHS and ask about SAKDFHSLKDJF".  I just don't need that when I am playing a computer game! ---  --- One thing that I do not care for about Oblivion is the way the monsters level with you.  The first character I had, I got up to level 15 and found myself being beaten up by goblins!  Unless you powergame (that is stragically plan your leveling to maximize stats and combat skills) or turn the difficulty way down, the leveling of monsters makes the game a real pain -- combat related quests (such as with the painted trolls) should not get harder the more you level. ---  --- All in all it is a pretty fun game, but before you buy, make sure you have a high end graphics card (or a lot of patience)! ---  ---  	pos

As a professional photographer, I find myself going through 5-6 of these cords each year. My equipment is my livelyhood and although  it is used often, I am exceptionally careful with all of my gear and do not bang it around or abuse it.  I use a stroboframe which makes it necessary to use this cord to raise the flash well above the focal plane of the camera.  These cords are very expensive to get just a few months out of them.  Eventually, the hot shoe connector will either become loose and the connection will no longer function or the plastic connector will break and your flash unit will fall to the ground. (This has happened twice to me and fortunately I was able to catch the flash unit!) ---  --- The cord is indespensible if you need it, but contact Canon USA and ask them to reengineer this cord or expect to replace them every few months	neg

I received this as a Christmas gift last year.  I followed the instructions in January, and by March the sprouts flourished into plants.  By summer, I had repotted all of them twice and they are now HUGE.  My friends are always shocked at the growth of my "basil tree", as they call it.  I owe my success to south-facing windows and religious watering (infused with drops of plant food.)  I don't have a green thumb at all - in fact, I'm a known plant-killer.  But I was able to get the Chia herb garden to grow like a charm. 	pos
I started my newborn out using the Avent bottles.  After a few weeks, she began crying alot.  You could hear the gas moving in her tummy, and every time her tummy would grumble, she would pull her legs up and shriek in pain.  She would also pass gas constantly.  It was so difficult to feed her because she would cough, spit and cry the whole time. Then she would be miserable with gas pains for hours afterwards.  I tried switching formulas - didn't work.  Tried mylicon, Zantac, gripe water, bicycling her legs, etc. etc. etc... nothing worked.  The pediatrician diagnosed her with colic and said there was nothing we could do, that she would outgrow it.  Finally, we decided to switch bottles (I switched to Playtex nursers.)  Instantly we noticed a difference!  She was extremely quiet during feedings, didn't squirm or cry!  She began ingesting almost TWICE as much formula per feeding(probably because her tummy was too full of gas to take in any more with the Avent bottles!) and would go longer between feeds. And when she swallowed, it sounded different - you could tell that she was no longer swallowing air!  Something about those Avent bottles made her swallow tons of air.  I think it was the suction that was created inside the bottle as she ate.  With the Playtex nursers, the liner inside the bottle contracts as she eats, eliminating any air bubbles.  She is a completely different baby now.  She is more alert and interacts with us much more because she spends less of her awake time crying. --- So if you decide to buy these bottles - BEWARE.  If you are already using them and your baby has colic, switch immediately!  Don't just assume that colic is "normal" or will be "outgrown."  Babies don't deserve to suffer this way!!!	neg
I am an elementary school teacher previewing this book in order to find a developmentally appropriate text for a study of religion. I am not religious and I strive to take a learner's stance and a scholarly approach to any unit of study that I present to my students. Betsy and Guilio Maestro have written other fabulous books on several topics; books that I have made available to my students for their research because they were accurate and presented without bias. This particular work unfortunately is neither. Their gesture was genuine and gracious, an example of the tolerance they wanted to promote. No deity need take offense; all were included in the pantheon of possibilities. It is however filled with inaccuracies and contradictions and finally a statement of belief by the authors. ---  --- Though written as an overview of many of the world religions, this book culminates in a doctrinal statement of the confusing theology of religious pluralism, the view that no religion is objectively truer than any other. One point ought to be obvious, though: Everything can't be true.  ---  --- The religions mentioned are like oil and water; they can't mix because they represent opposite and competing concepts. An appeal to their similarities doesn't help. We would never say aspirin and arsenic are basically the same just because they both come in tablet form. It's the differences that are critical. That's true in all areas of life, especially the spiritual. ---  --- If God exists, He's either personal or not personal. He can't be both. If God is merely a cosmic energy, why ask His blessing? He can't hear or respond. If He's a person, then He's someone, not everyone. ---  --- This book is not as much a story of religions as it is a recipe for religious stew	neg
The 30 reviews before mine gave pretty complete description about the watch.

   There is not enough space for me to explain why this film(and soundtrack) are woefully inadequate of the name Dr. Seuss. ---  ---     The Fact that there are so many songs on the album screams commercialism(what the book was complaining about, wake up people!) and James Horner's score which has a couple of nice moments but doesn't have that Seussian sound.

I used to have some Remington shaver that a friend bought me for the last 5 yrs.  It wasn't bad, but sometimes it irritated the skin.  my first shaver was my dad's old school norelco shaver so i thought i'd give them a try again.  the first one i got from amazon was $40 (i forgot the model #) and ended up sending it back to norelco for their 60 day guarantee.  it was just alright.  this one i feel about the same way.  i mean it shaves decently, but as an asian male with not much facial hair, i still see that i have to shave every couple days which i prefer not to.  the cleaning system is cool, and the fact that this shaver is so easy to clean (it says you can open it up and run it under water which i've been doing to clean it) make it worthwhile to me though.  the battery life is also good.  if there was a half star system, i'd give this shaver a 4.5/5	pos

While filled with talented performers, this cd sucks.  ---  --- Rocky is a campy, 1970's B-Movie, that's what makes it enjoyable. Even as a stage show it's a hokey, rock-and-roll extravaganza.  ---  --- This cd tries to turn Rocky into Thoroughly Modern Millie, and it just doesn't work. The corny sci-fi sound and less than amazing vocals are just what make Rocky..Rocky. This cast has so much less enthusiasm and energy than the original Roxy cast. ---  --- And lastly, Tim Curry is Frank. His rendition is too ingrained in my head for me to accept the twangy annoyance that is the Frank on this album. Ripley is a little too legit for Janet, and the female Eddie weirds me out.  ---  --- Buy the Roxy cast. It's so superior it's almost laughable.	neg

This is one of the best G3s.  Maybe even the best.  I would have said that it was definitely the best if not for Mr.Malmsteen - the nicest thing one can say about the latter is that he knows his minor and major scales. ---  --- But *I* don't want to be nice.  I want to be absolutely and unequivocally cruel when it comes to Malmsteen. ---  --- He knows alternate picking, I'll give him that.  But then, so do I - and a million others.  He shouldn't be up there playing with Vai and Satriani solely because he can alternate pick faster than most (not all) people .  And yet he is. ---  --- He shows over and over again, in this show, that the only thing he can do with the guitar is shred and shred and shred some more.  That's all. One of the interesting things about this DVD is that one cannot really measure the time between two consecutive shredding runs that Yngwie chooses to execute - it's less than about a second.  And this is an *average* figure. ---  --- Enough about Yngwie, though he is the reason I'm writing this review - Satriani is absolutely amazing, as usual, with a brand new rendition of 'Midnight' and a nice solo at the end of 'Starry Night'. ---  --- Vai, though, steals the show.  This coming from a guy who prefers Satriani.  But I can't help it - he is really that good.  And better.  'I Know You're Here'(which he plays on a triple neck Jem) contains at least seven new approaches to the same old things that you're taught at guitar school.  It is also the best song Steve Vai has ever written after 'Fire Garden Suite'.  ---  --- 'Juice' and 'I'm the Hell Outta Here' are also really really really good. ---  --- Overall, a great DVD, though you should probably skip the parts with Yngwie in it	pos

Giorgio Armani is know for his excellence and fineness when it comes to his clothing, accessories, bags and of course: Fragrances. Acqua di Gio is remarkable, distinguished, and flawless in every sense. It has been the best-selling cologne since its release and has become synonymous with sexy. 99% of people (men and women) who come in contact with you on the daily basis will compliment you on your smell (at least in my case.) I'm not complimented on any cologne I own more than this one so I usually wear it when I know I'll be in contact with more than a few people. This fragrance is truly awe-inspiring and it proves once again that when it comes to delicate scents, Armani is king	pos
There is absolutely nothing special about this leave-in conditioner, besides the fact that it smells really good.  However, I didn't see any changes in my daughter's hair after using this conditioner.  NONE.  It is watered down so you must rub it in your hair very quickly. Otherwise, it will run down your face and neck (wish it came with a spray pump instead).  I was expecting some sort of difference since this product line is well-known and has a lot of star/ celebrity power behind it.  However, I found this conditioner to be all hype	neg
There's nothing in this I'd say even remotely resembles jazz. It's repetitive, has a rock beat, and consists mostly of licks taken from other players. If you're looking for backrgound music to play in a waiting room, this might be a good choice	neg
I agree completely with the previous reviewer--this licorice does not even come close to the usual quality of --- Haribo candy.

It's been 30 years since I've seen this film on cable.  I decided to re-visit this obscure film and see if I missed anything in the initial viewing.  As it turned out, I didn't miss anything.  It's pretty much the same, routine Sam Peckinpah film, filled with lots of blood, guts, bullets and slow-motion action.  It's also a long, tedious film that is not one of his best, but will satisfy those who enjoy ultra-violence in their movies	neg

The mattress pad topper has a strong chemical smell. After receiving it, I left it in an open room for 2 weeks before I can sleep on it. The "free" pillow smells even worse. It can be not exchanged since it is "free". I guess I am supposed to toss it since it's "free".                 I think it will be fair to mention that the topper is comfortable, after all.	neg

I have enjoyed "Goldfish" and other cheese-based snack crackers since I was a child, but no more. I tried these Cheddar Bunnies as I have enjoyed other products by Annie's, and have now found my all-time favorite snack cracker.  ---  --- From a nutritional standpoint, they are better than many competing products as they have no hydrogenated oils or artificial flavors, and are made from organic ingredients, including real Wisconsin cheddar cheese. The packaging does an excellent job of preserving freshness, the taste is natural and very refreshing for a snack food, and the price is comparable to other non-organic products.  ---  --- I am completely satisfied with these crackers: the are a good value, they compare favorably in the nutritional realm with competitors (although they really don't qualify as "health food," of course,) they taste fantastic, and last but not least, they're fun	pos

I recently purchased a pair of the Gripmaster Hand & Finger Exercisers in order to help build forearm strength.  As I was unsure which tension would be appropriate, I bought one each of the Light/Blue (5 lbs. tension) and Medium/Red (7 lbs. tension) grips.  I've had them for a little more than a week now, and I just love, love, love them!  Perhaps that's a little more enthusiasm than anyone should muster up for exercise accessories, but I really do enjoy the grips.  I leave one out on my desk at all times, and get in a little work here and there when I stop to read a document or whatnot.   ---  --- The Gripmaster Exercisers are different from conventional grips in that you can either work your entire hand at once, or each finger individually (great for guitar players, I've heard!).  One side features four small levers, each with its own spring, that can be squeezed together or one at a time.  The plastic on the flip side is molded together so that you can work your whole hand as one unit.  The black rubber cushion is removable, and you can place it on either side of the grip.  It's an awesome idea, and allows for maximum versatility!   ---  --- Just for reference, I'm a female, in relatively good shape, but with painfully little forearm strength (my biceps are huge from years of Tae Bo, though!).  The 7 lb. Medium/Red grip is do-able, but challenging.  The 5 lb. Light/Blue grip, on the other hand, makes for a much easier workout; I oftentimes find myself squeezing it while doing other things, and I only feel it after a number of reps.  If you're a female and not in great shape, you'll want to start out with the Light/Blue grips (or even the Extra Light/Yellow ones), and work your way up.  Out-of-shape guys can probably get away with the Medium/Red ones to start.  If you've got good hand/wrist/forearm strength, don't even both with the lighter tensions - skip ahead to the Medium/Red or Heavy/Black.    ---  --- Although I've only owned my Gripmasters for a week or two, and can't personally vouch for their durability, they do seem sturdy and well-crafted.  My fianc's brother, an amateur boxer and guitar player, used his for years without a problem, so I have faith that I'll be squeezing these babies well into 2015! ---  --- - Kelly Garbato, Couch Potato Turned Fitness Fanati	pos
Perfectly in keeping with the imperialist ethos that he so proudly and loudly espouses, Boot has foisted upon us a book that rests entirely on the labors of others.   ---  --- Lacking even the slightest trace of shame, he plunders concepts and ideas from anyplace in the intellisphere he chooses.  As a result, there's nary a new thought nor insight to be found anywhere within these pages. ---  --- Even more pitiably, like a renegade third world nuclear scientist trying to "sanitize" his clandestinely-acquired apparatus of any markings that might possibly identify its source, Boot assiduously scrubs away any subtleties and nuance that the original thoughts may have possessed.  One wearies quickly of the Manichaean results. ---  --- And like any ideologically-driven but technically inept would-be nuclear (or social) engineer, he fails utterly in his attempt to enrich his raw material even minimally, succeeding only in rendering it more toxic and hazardous than it originally was. ---  --- Why, even the title itself has been purloined from Alistair Home's 1977 underground classic, "A Savage War of Peace"!*  Considering that Home's tome arrives at essentially the opposite conclusions from Boot's, this is irony most profound. ---  --- It is scarcely surprising, then, that recent history has thoroughly discredited the philosophies and policies so ear-splittingly trumpeted in Boot's book, thus rendering moot any lingering interest one might have had in perusing it -- unless one wishes to take counsel for the future by ruminating upon the Ozymandian ruins of Boot's espoused belief system. ---  ---  --- * Recently reprinted and highly recommended! --- 	neg

I purchased this shampoo for my daughter after she read rave reviews in a teen magazine.  She has thick, blonde hair and it was dry from summer heat, pool water, and light styling.  After trying the rehab shampoo, she was so disappointed that it did nothing to help her hair.  She said that while it lathered nicely, it felt like it stripped her hair and when it rinsed out, it left her hair overly 'squeeky' and tangled.  The end result once her hair was dried (after using conditioner, too), was that it was a lighter shade of blonde, very fly-away, and dry feeling.  She was hoping for smoother, easier to manage hair.  We debated purchasing this shampoo because of its high cost, and I have to say we are extremely disappointed.  The claims were hype, and the results were not delivered.  Her hair was by no means 'fried' or severely damaged, so I fully expected her to have some more manageable locks after using the product, based on its claims.  I will say that I bought her a shampoo and condition at the drug store that has helped dramatically.  It is Thermasilk Smooth & Silky line, and it works wonders over Rehab for a fraction of the cost.  Save your money on this one	neg
Of the printed daily newspapers, WSJ is easily the superior in just about every aspect that really matters. NYT has a lot more and better photographs, but they are best viewed on a computer screen. There's not much to argue (regarding the relatively conservative editorial page) in this review that hasn't already been written; and one more center-right Midwesterner's recommendation is not going to be of much incremental value. However, as an investor and consumer I can state that WSJ and its website have been the primary source of credible information about businesses, law, finance and consumer products. Anybody that works for a living, has a mortgage or has a long-term savings plan would benefit from reading the WSJ as often as possible. There's simply no substitute	pos
This is my favorite toning workout and I'm sure to incorporate it into my routine for my once a week tone-fest. What I like best about it is that I can customize it to whatever body part I think needs the most work this week. Need a 30 minute ab workout? You can choose it. Think the arms and legs need work? No problem. Want to tone a little bit of everything? You can do that, too. ---  --- The instructors are all good - clear, not irritating, and they come up with some unique exercises to work each body part - it's not your standard crunches for ab work on this video.  ---  --- This was one of my best purchases, workout-wise. I wish there were more DVD's/workouts out there with Minna Lessig - she is my favorite instructor (she does the arm/leg workouts on this DVD). The other two instructors are wonderful as well - and the workout just seems to fly by, although at the end you do know you've worked those muscle groups.	pos
I really enjoy top down and side scrolling shooters, so take this opinion with that in mind.  The only problem with R-Type is that dying sucks.  When you die you restart from a usually bad position without any powerups.  Once you unlock free-play this can make the game frustrating when you are playing new stages or playing with a different ship etc.  However overall I think it's the best of the R-types and one of the better side scrollers out there.	pos
MSR's Pocket Rocket is a great little cooker.  Best for going light and fast. Perfect as a shared stove among two people, and even better for simple boiling or melting snow for drinking water. I would suggest this stove for use with a maximum pot capacity of two liters, more than this and it becomes a little unstable. --- If your menu is simple and you live on instant meals that require only boiling water this is the stove for you. Because this is a stove designed for the minimalist, it is tiny and has a very concentrated hot spot, so if you are a backcountry gourmet and want to cook pancakes and eggs you might be better off with a stove that has a larger flame spread.  Again, great for boiling water and melting snow, but not for actual cooking	pos

While some critics can argue with Dan Brown's research and reasoning on certain historical points, one thing these Da Vinci "debunking" presentations will never be able to refute is this: the downplaying of the feminine role in western civilization and Christianity, primarily by the Catholic Church, and the fact that the Church still considered Mary Magdalene a common prostitute until just a few short years ago: 1969. Nor is it possible to refute the recent polymorphously perverse scandals that have rocked the Church after centuries of suppression and may have everything to do with the doctrinal distortions that Dan Brown has brought out in the open for serious review. This institution is in trouble because it is seriously out of balance with itself and has cut off its spiritual nose to despite its face by downplaying or denigrating the role of women as sacred beings and bearers of the Light, when their healthy presence is needed more than ever as a corrective to some of these abuses and scandals. Dan Brown has done the world a great service by showing how the feminine role in the divine was written out 2000 years ago, with help from Peter whose misogynistic views of women are plainly evident in the scriptures even today and are still, quite frankly, shocking and debasing. Sorry, but upon this "Rock" of male dominancy was built the Church. ---  --- Thank you again, Dan Brown, by bringing these matters into the light of day so people can know more of their authentic history or at least do their own research to make up their own minds about which spiritual path is best for them and which ones were built on two millenniums worth of manipulations, obscurations and lies. These obscurations and lies happened through the efforts of a group of petty, insecure and misguided men down through the centuries to ensure their dominance and control over the masses, and they found a way to dominate not only the minds of the masses but their vast material resources, worth trillions, through guilt, control and other hidden but consistent abuses of power. And those of orthodox faith who continue to blindly support such hypocritical institutions have a lot more to answer for than any twenty Dan Browns put together. People are angry and they are angry at the failure of religion to live up to its own standards of behavior and for distorting what may have been Jesus' actual relationship with the women in his life--or were the disciples just supposed to be members of a exclusive Men's Club with Jesus as head and women as a species relegated to second class citizenship? To answer these questions, some of you will finally have to turn to your own heart and mind for a change instead of some literal interpretation of the truth, because not everything of the light is found in scriptures or on the printed page, especially after the scriptures have been selectively riddled with scissors for reasons of self-interest or from spiritual corruption. The next thing people should ask for is to have the vaults of the Vatican thrown open for public view. Lord only knows what plunder they contain	neg
Based on negative reviews, either I've been knitting too long to still have good sense, or completely in the dark when it comes to this magazine. It is my favorite, and I do not always follow patterns exactly but use ideas in my own sweaters. I found about 6 cardigans in just the last 2-3 issues (a reviewer didn't find any in a couple years of issues). Re Zimmerman-type designs, you can make any sweater in one or two pieces, change gauge, needle sizes, yarns, etc. Search Websites to give you the basics for free. After 2 years of crochet, I learned to knit at age 8 with 2 pencils for needles, found that quad-ruled pads were great to chart patterns whether plain, fancy, Aran, Jacquard, sideways or you-name-it. I like Knit 'N Style. Thanks for reading this	pos
This is an imaginative take on the Jack and the Beanstalk story. While it was apparently made for kids, the story maintains enough complexity to keep adults interested (I'm 19). Plus as a female, I appreciate the fact that it's one of the few stories where (possible spoiler) the damsel (who's in a different kind of distress than other fairy tale women) rescues Prince Charming.  Well-acted, it features some great chemistry between Sara and Modine.   ---  --- But I still can't give it 5 stars.  Here's why (spoilers ahead): ---  --- 1. I'm no math person but why couldn't the writers be consistent with when Jack's dad died? One minute, they say he died 20 years ago but then they say he died when Jack was 14. Since Jack is 37, it shows that the writers can't do simple addition. Couldn't they just take two seconds to do the math?  ---  --- 2. How the hell does Siggy know about goose and harp? I got the impression from Wilhemina that Jack's dad didn't believe the story of the original Jack. But apparently, Jack's dad told Siggy not to tell him about the family's dark secret until he was ready. I wish there was a more believable explanation for Siggy knowing a lot more than he should.  ---  --- 3. If Siggy is smart enough to know the all the Robinson secrets, I think he should be able to catch on to the fact that Jack is in love with Ondine fairly quickly. I always wondered why he didn't try to kill Ondine when he was so against Jack having an heir.  I understand that they had a time limit to the movie and maybe it would have been a bit scary for the little ones. Don't get me wrong, I don't want Ondine to die.  I wanted nothing less than a happy ending for her and Jack.  But shooting her (or at least threatening her) would have been a great way to kick up the tension/suspense.  ---  --- 4. Siggy's accent and mannerisms were an attempt at comedy that --- completely fell flat. It was not funny and was a bit gratuitous. ---  --- But if you're a fan of romance, adventure, or just feel-good movies in general, those things shouldn't keep you from enjoying this film.  Don't think too much about the plot holes- you'll go insane if you do	pos
This is the third time I have purchased Handyman Magazine for family members as gifts.  This time, I misunderstood how to gift the item.  Unfortunately, I did not have a second chance to send the magazine to a family member as a Christmas Gift.  After calling, the only recourse I was given was to to refuse the magazine when it comes (because it is coming to me instead of my son in Atlanta), call and cancel the order and reorder.  Unfortunately, doing this, it will not reach my son in time for Christmas.  I would like to see something built into the system that gives a second chance to bill me, but send as a gift	pos

This is our second Weber grill in the past 10 years.  In fact the new grill is essentially the exact same grill as the one we purchased in the '90s...same size and features.  We actually use natural gas rather than propane (I goofed on the order), but we were able to quickly transplant the conversion kit from the old grill to the new one.  We've used it a few times and it works perfectly.  Quickly heats up and grills evenly.  Looking forward to many years of great meals off this grill	pos

Herf applies a very simplistic test to determine the Nazification of both Germanies: did they side with Israel in the Middle East version of the Cold War or did they not? The trial against Paul Merker in the East, which had as its background East Germany's reluctance to pay reparations to expropriated Jews, serves as his prime evidence for the continuation of things Nazi in the GDR. But both of these arguments completely ignore the Marxist ideology underlieing the rationale of the East German leadership and bypass more complicated issues of political allegiance. Moreover, they totally eclipse the East German cultural discourse on the Holocaust, a discourse that was decades ahead of discussions in the West and still proves to be more sophisticated than most that is being written in Western academia.	neg
I added this toy to my son's xmas list. With much luck he did get it; and we are pleased ! I would not say that it's a "fun to play with" toy but the entertainment value still exists. The planets are large enough without being overbearing up on the ceiling. They glow at night..which is the best part !! At 36 years old I can't wait for  nighttime to hang in my sons room to check out the  planets!  The stars the set comes with are perfect. They are NOT the bulky plastic ones that can be seen day or night. They are paper stickers that disappear during the day (on the celing they do anyway) The planets come with name stickers which adds educational value. My son is five and LOVES, LOVES, LOVES these planets. I say get 'em !! ---  ---  Lisa Avilio-Meyer	pos
I bought the smaller version "Diaper Decor" (as opposed to the larger "Diaper Decor Plus") about 18 months ago.  Although I believe the smaller version has been discontinued about a year ago, I have not yet had a problem finding the refill liners at my local Babies R Us or on-line here at Amazon.  I highly recommend the Diaper Decor. I do not have any experience with the Diaper Genie, so I cannot compare. I have not had any odor problems with the Diaper Decor.  It is very easy to change the liners and there is no mess. My foot-operated lid opener also broke like some other reviewers, but this has not been a problem with me.  I just open the lid manually and leave it open while I am changing the diaper. I would recommend the Diaper Decor in the Plus size	pos

I never played the original and don't really want to. This game was such a treasure to find with it's phenomonal music and graphics, engrossing gameplay, twisted plot, and the variety of characters possible to play. I have lost a lot of sleep over this game and I'm not even half way done. ---  --- If anything, it has some of the best show of PS2 graphics I have seen-something to expect from a Square-Enix production. The wind moving through the environments, the water trickling, the sort-of dream-like haze in the towns. It all culminates into an eye-pleaser if nothing else. But the gameplay and game engineering is also top quality. The character designs are very diverse with many periods of time and cultures represented. There is a fairly even mix of female and male characters as well as classes like archers, light warriors, mages, ect.  ---  --- The menu navigation and ability to load different game data at anytime (other than combat) is a serious perk that many take for granted. You can keep loading a game when you don't get the einherjar you want until the randomized selection gives you the perfect group you are looking to adventure with. The ability to instantly travel to any location on the map without lengthy travel from location to location keeps the pace nice and brisk giving you only what you want, buying equipment and battles.  ---  --- The difficulty is right where it needs to be, if you do a quick run game, you will have a tough time beating the boss. It's nice not to have leveling forced on you but rather as an elective thing so that you can get through the story when you want to. The battles are clever, mixing tactical RPG with action making it very engaging and actually fun. There is a degree of button mashing, but then again, it's not a static or boring as the your turn, my turn, cast a spell, drink a potion. It's actually combat, like it should be.  ---  --- I can't praise this game enough...I don't care how good the first was, it can't be better than this one. This will certainly go down as a best title for the PS2. If I had any complaints, it would be the recycled voice-commentary for different einherjar and the fact that they really aren't involved with the main story-line. Oh, and since they would be stupid not to make a third one, customizable armor would have been the cream of the crop. VP2 is a solid offering for the last PS2 has to offer	pos

Seriously, I don't know how anyone can use this thing.  I have had tatoos, waxing, and dental fillings, and I would rather have any and all of those before I ever try this product again.  It feels like an electric shock and continuous pulling of duct tape on your skin.  Just awful.  In the products defense, I don't think there is a way to make this device easy to use and leg friendly (God forbid you try it anywhere else, ladies!!).  I was able to remove the hair from about 2 inches of my leg and I gave into the pain and went back to shaving.  Yikes	neg
or in their entire career for that matter.  I have tried to like this band, but Greg Dulli just won't shut up.  Every song is his snide lyrical diatribing, on and on and on.  The guitarist keeps things mildly interesting, but on this album in particular, the drummer also won't shut up and play a straight beat for once.  It's like three guys in their own worlds, and they mash it together and call what they've done songs.  EXCEPT for the one decent song they did, the only rock song I can think of that is hard, psychedelic, passionate, powerful, and set to a waltz beat of all things.  "LEt me lie to you" is the best song they ever made, BECAUSE everyone in the band is given room to breathe by the song's framework and tempo.  Instead of piling in on top of each other till the end of the song like they usually seem to do, everyone agrees to hold back until the rushing choruses, and it's less muddled and better orchestrated for it.  IT's a shame they didn't do any other songs like this, at least none that I have heard.  I tried to like them, I really did.  I wanted to find the band that made that one song, and discover a whole treasure chest of dark, passionate, noisy music like that.  Too bad, no wonder they drifted apart	neg
I am a huge fan of Tasty Bite products, and was delighted to find that Amazon now stocks them, since they are expensive in my small town (no Trader Joe's here!). I was excited to see this variety that I had never tried before, and readily ordered the six pack of these noodles with peanut sauce, expecting the same ready-to-eat food that the other Tasty Bites I have tried offer. ---  --- But unlike their ready-to-eat rice dishes in which the rice and the packet merely need heating but are already fully cooked, the noodles here are in their raw state and need to be boiled for ten minutes, so you can't grab this and bring it to work the way you can most other Tasty Bite meals. ---  --- Also, the peanut sauce has a delectable and complex flavor, but is spiced and textured so that I felt it really needed some vegetables and or meat to round it out. I love spicy dishes, but this meal seemed planned to be overly spiced so that when you add the veggies and meat, it would be perfect. ---  --- So, as a quick meal starter at home or as a way of helping to use up leftover meat and veggies, this gets five stars. It was delicious. Some additions I have enjoyed are chicken, steak, bell pepper, cauliflower, carrots, eggplant, and sweet potato.  ---  --- But I am giving this meal four stars overall because my expectation from eating other Tasty Bite entrees was that this was a grab and go meal that I could pop in the microwave and have prepared in a couple of minutes.	pos

The cards are beautiful and reflect the care that was taken to design and assemble them. There is a good variety of colors and styles. However, there is a lack of cards appropriate for male recipients. The cards are mostly for female recipients. Nonetheless, it's a great product and I enjoy giving these cards to others for special occasions	pos
My wife and I have slightly different tasates in coffee, I like mine darker and she like a milder coffee.  This one however is just right for both of us.

I wish we had found this coffee sooner, it is great	pos
The first edition of Don't Look Back was the first DVD I ever bought and I bought a DVD player the same day.  ---  --- It is an execellent example of the power and pitfalls of "cinema verite/direct cinema", a style emerging in the 1960s made possible by lightweight sound sync cameras and recorders, zoom lenses, and fast film stock.  The "who threw the f-- glass" altercation followed by the cruel juxtoposition of Donovon offering "Song for You" to which Dylan responds with a smirk and "It's All Over Now Baby Blue" is one of the great passages in documentary film. ---  --- You may love or hate Dylan's music and after watching the film, you aren't left with any illusions about him being a nice person.  But he is a force of nature.  Lyrics poured through him, some timely, some timeless, raw ones and delicate ones.  For me he was always better on recordings than in person, and the film reminds me why.  But I'm glad to have this glimpse of  the artist. ---  --- I don't know about the "deluxe edition".  It may be worth it for the higher quality telecine transfer.  The original film does not need amplification.  It reveals more about Dylan than the bloated "No Direction Home" that used so much of the same footage	pos
One tiresome, heavy-handed simile after another; agonizing, descriptive detail that unnecessarily prolongs action; simplistic, trite phrasing and dialogue -- characters constantly express vague but contradictory emotions in the same sentence, an obvious effort by the author to provoke interest or conflict which falls flat; routine characterization; a sentence or two slipped in during a scene or an unexpected circumstance placed at the end of a chapter meant to build plot and suspense read as forced and predictable; proofreading errors; fragmented, poor sentence structure -- this book is amateurish writing all the way around.  I cannot fathom the reasoning for the quality of the professional reviews which this work received.  I cannot understand the lack of proper editing.  I am an avid reader and approached this book with much enthusiasm, so imagine my disappointment when I was ready to put the book down a couple of pages into the Prologue!  In fairness to the author (and with a hopeful attitude), I forced myself through the first 70 or so pages, however with each turning page I found myself reading along just for sport, my mind constantly drifting and more and more incredulous (and annoyed) with this juvenile effort. What could have been a fascinating read due to the intriguing premise is instead a colossal waste of time. 	neg
I write very few reviews, but I just wanted to share my unbelievable success with healing my cracked heels.  I have fought this battle many years, with no success.

When my baby was a newborn we left our closet light on all night at first so we could check on him.  It was also a jarring necessity to turn on the overhead light for diaper changes and feedings.  Then I bought one of these lights and was impressed at the perfect amount of light it gives out.  Just enough to see your baby by, but not enough to keep everyone awake.  It's been almost a year now, and I'm just about to purchase two more.  We use the light now in our toddler's room and turning it on is now part of our bedtime routine.  We use it every night	pos
We used the travelling toddler on our vacation with our 11 month-old son to Mexico.  We always buy him his own seat on the plane for his safety and it was a very convenient way to get through the airport with his seat and luggage.  He was attached to our rolling carry-on curbside and off we went.  We were able to check our stroller and we had little to carry.  At $20, you can't beat the price.  Our friends had to carry their car seat, stroller, luggage and child and were wishing they would have bought the strap	pos

I got Very Irresistible by Givenchy Perfume as a gift for Christmas.  As first smell, I loved it.  Then I spritzed it and yikes! That was 2 months ago and I still have the scent on me. ---  --- It's too flowery -- it's not a clean, fresh scent.  More of a "I sprayed a little too much potpouri in here" scent.  Not for people with mild allergies to perfumes either!!	neg
It took no time to figure out how to use this seat.  My daughter meets the minimum height and weight requirements, so I am moving here from a 5 point harness Britax to this booster in a second car.  The seat is easy to install and remove, and also easy to stowe in the trunk when not in use by simply pulling the rear latch and folding.  I can definately see using it for travel on planes, as it is easy to fold and light enough to carry.  My daughter also likes the fold out cup holders for water.  They are sturdy and easy to tuck back in when storing or carrying the seat.  Highly recommended.	pos

Interesting premise, but the plot is like swiss cheese.  --- This review will just be a point by point of all the major things that I found so implausable that I couldn't just suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride. Spoilers alert.  --- I wasn't able to make the leap to believing Sarah's sudden turn towards malicious opportunism as soon as she saw the cash. When questioned about what she would do if she found some hypothetical millions, she insists with chirpy disinterest that she would certainly turn it in. Just one scene of her looking longingly at a brochure for a holiday she couldn't afford would have established some repressed dissatisfation with her life situation, but her general demeanor seemed to suggest not only comfort, but satisfaction.  --- Why did Hank decide he would burn the money instead of return it if it turned out someone legitimately owned it? Surely it wouldn't be too difficult to anonymously return it without being implicated in it's disappearance. --- The first murder, after the old guy regained consciousness, why did Hank not try to negotiate with or threaten the old guy to keep quiet about his brother assaulting him? For Hank, finishing the job his brother started didn't seem like an absolute last resort, it seemed like he took the murder lightly.  --- When Hank got home apparently he volunteered information to his wife about what he'd just done. What? Like he knew she'd be understanding about it or something? Hi honey, I'm home, by the way I just killed a man to protect the money. Wtf? --- When Jacob shot Lou to protect Hank, why didn't Hank just give the tape back before it got to that point?  --- The shotgun impact on Lou's wife was cartoonishly ridiculous, sending her flying three feet into the air when the blast didn't even hit her at an upward trajectory.  --- And the final ridiculous flaw. Jacob taking the fake FBI agent's gun, and instead of just shooting himself before his brother had time to react, he hands it to his brother, and charges him with the responsibility of killing him, setting up the final emotional crescendo of the film. Supposedly the explanation was that it wouldn't look like the fake FBI agent shot Jacob if the shot was fired at point blank range, but why not? Why couldn't forensic investigators at the scene believe an altercation could have transpired where Jacob charged at the gunman from behind when he was about to shoot the sheriff, wrestled with him, and wound up taking a point blank shot to the head? It really makes no sense.  --- One inspiredly believable moment I will give them film credit for is Hank's difficulty in finding the bullets in the sheriff's office and loading the gun. A lazier writer would have just had him find the gun loaded. --- If the major plot developments were fleshed out in more detail to be made believable this could have been a great film. As it is, it's a frustratingly flaw-ridden glimpse of what could have been and a waste of time to watch. 	neg

I just want to put it out there...Audra McDonald is an absolute genious. Everything she touches turns to gold, and I just want to smack some of you for saying that she failed in her attempt to make a great record. This may not be the audra that we are used to, but if you listen closely she's near by. So this CD is a little less difficult vocally. So what? My favorite quality of Ms. McDonald's is that she is emotionally connected to whatever she is singing. She could record twinkle twinkle little star and I would want to listen to it over and over again because she tells a story. So if you buy this CD, listen to it more than once. Let it grow on you. Let Audra do her thang children. Let her do her thang.	pos
An EXACT copy of Ang Lee's wonderful "Eat Drink Man Woman".  Frankly what annoyed me here was I watched this one first.. I just finished watching Eat Drink.. it took me about 15 minutes to realize I was watching an exact copy of something I'd already seen a couple years ago. Anyway, I was annoyed because while I could predict events in Eat Drink because I'd seen Tortilla Soup, Eat Drink was clearly the better movie -- so unfortunately it spoiled some of the pleasure of Eat Drink for me. If you haven't seen either, see the better of the two (exact same stories): Eat Drink Man Woman	neg
The quality of the DVD's was good. However I did not like the third season as well as the first two seasons. It seemed that the story was setting up for season 4.	neg
Be sure you have a very flat, smooth surface for these bumper cars. There is almost zero clearance between the driving surface and the bumper part of the car. Our girls rode them in our driveway/sidewalk and constantly got stuck on uneven surfaces or the edge of the driveway. We had to make the girls get out and pick up and move the car to a flat surface. These are probably much better for a basement or a perfectly flat surface like a tennis or basketball court. 	neg
I rarely write reviews of music but feel that I must share my impressions of this CD.  I have long heard some of my favorite singers praise the songwriting prowess of Townes but somehow never got around to buying one of his records.  I finally picked this one up because it had two songs that were covered by two of my favorite singers--Lyle Lovett-"Lungs" (among others) and Steve Earle-"Tecumseh Valley".  I was blown away by the sheer beauty and poetry of every song on this recording.  Other reviewers seem to be comparing this to other Townes' records.  I come from a different angle.  As someone who has long heard Townes sopken of with the highest praise, I can say this disk does not disappoint and will influence me to fill out my collection of his recordings.  I will also say that I am deeply frustrated that I never took advantage of the chance to see Townes perform while he was alive. 	pos

This play tent is great - my son got it when he was 1 and still loves it a year later.  He brings toys in there and "hides" to play.

If you think you are buying the old Met-RX bars by the same flavors, you are in for a very very bad surprise. The old bars had better taste and a almost cake-like consistency. These were so sticky that I could pick up papers just by touching them after eating one.  Also, I couldn't get past the taste. Even the color is different.  ---  --- I never finished the bar and I used to eat one a day (years ago). I gave the entire box away for free. ---  --- I will not buy these again until the go back to their old recipe.	neg
My three girls ages 3 to 7 liked this toy when added to their pretend food collection. We didn't use it as a game. You can place the different frosting and sprinkle combination pieces onto the different colors of donuts to make different varieties. Each would take a turn 'ordering' types of donuts and the others would 'make' them. Yes, the frosting won't stay on if the donut turns over but fits in easily and works great on a plate for pretend play! Box is flimsy but we just keep all the pieces in our general play food bin so not an issue. Would buy this again. Great for kids with imaginations	pos

It is hard when you have an infant to secure them in their car seat with a huge snowsuit on. I found myself dredding going out because my daughter would look like an eskimo in her car seat.  I was delighted when I found the Urban Me Bundle.  I don't have to worry about bundling her up in heavy gear when we go out.  We just put on her hat and go.  The Urban Me Bundle gives your child enough breathing room as well as providing warmth and comfort.  It helps too that it is rain resistant.  I have received many compliments on my Urban Me Bundle and found it to be a wise investment. It really doesn't compare to the other ones that are on the market because you can definitely see the difference in quality of the fabric inside and out	pos

  While it's certainly true that there will always be a gulf between reality and words, communication between reader and writer is nonetheless very real and potentially profound, thanks in no small part to empathy and the imagination. Deconstructionism, by denying presence and instead proposing unlimited differences between signs, dismisses any connection between readers and writers and turns language into a hermetic system separated from the outside world which is, of course, inhabited by people who read and people who write. This is exactly what makes deconstructionism so empty and hypocritical: It rejects traditional metaphysics while adopting a pseudo-mystical position which regards language as some unstable and solipsistic alien creature independent of everything and everyone	neg

 ---       --- THE BAD NEWS FIRST: DOESN'T SEEM TO WORK WELL WITHOUT ADDING EXTRA DETERGENT  ---  --- It seems like this is NOT 3x concentration, and like others we found we had to compensate by adding more detergent than the directions said to get the same results as we did with the standard formula. Otherwise, the two products, 'concentrated' and 'standard srength' are the same.  ---  --- MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT - THIS IS CONCENTRATED & COMES OUT LIKE HEINZ KETCHUP: ---  --- It does seem to be concentrated, and we did notice a certain amount of difficulty getting the detergent out of the bottle, kind of reminded us of Heinz ketchup. ---  --- 4-STAR or 5-STAR PRODUCT?  ---  --- The standard strength product is clearly a 5-STAR product, however owing to the fact that this product does not work as well without adding more detergent than the direction claim, it rates 4-STARs with our family.  ---  ---  --- TRYING TO LEARN OBJECTIVE INFO ON LAUNDRY DETERGENT IS WELL . . . .  ---  --- THE FOLLOWING IS TRUE OF THIS PRODUCT IN STANDARD STRENGTH or 3X WITH EXTRA DETERGENT ADDED:  ---  --- I am allergic to most laundry detergents, but this product has prevented severe discomfort for me for about 10 years. It is consistently among the lowest-priced detergents available. In addition to being very easy on clothes and skin, it does work quite well in the stain-removal department and can be used as its own presoak. This is good to know if you are like me and are trying to avoid allergens. It is important to remember that if you buy a hypoallergenic powder detergent instead of a liquid like this, you may have to pre-soak stains and you won't have a hypoallergenic liquid with which to do it. While "Tide" and "Cheer" are also available in hypoallergenic formulas,["Tide Free" is actually just unscented] they are considerably more expensive and work no better in my experience. That's why I like this "All Liquid Detergent - Free Clear, Laundry Detergent".  ---  --- OBJECTIVE INFORMATION IS TOUGH TO FIND!  ---  --- I actually did conduct a hard target search for true, objective information on laundry detergents. There is very little beyond which brand causes pollution which, while important, is not what I was trying to find. "Consumer Reports" does have test comparisons of the most popular brands in its monthly magazine every couple of years and they do include some detail.  ---  --- ABOUT "ALL'S WEBSITE"  ---  --- If you are looking for this product's website it is under "Unilever" and you will have to specify "USA" under products, as the word "ALL" will show up in almost every search result. You will find "WISK" and "BREYER'S ICE CREAM" and almost as many neat name brand products as you would at Procter and Gamble's site.  ---  --- [I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY] 	pos
The author of the Declaration of Independence and promoter of a bill of rights for the U.S. Constitution, Thomas Jefferson once wrote: "I read no newspaper now but Ritchie's, and in that chiefly the advertisements, for they contain the only truths to be relied on in a newspaper." [Letter to Nathaniel Macon, January 12, 1819] ---  --- The Nation is not a newspaper. Rather it is a weekly compilation of informed opinion and investigative reportage that reports what the main stream press and infotainment TV doesn't dare to. Those Americans whose minds have been addled by a steady stream of ideological propaganda and lies call The Nation "left wing," "liberal," "radical," etc., etc.  ---  --- Plato had written 2,300 years ago his Allegory of the Cave: "Behold! human beings living in an underground den, which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching all along the den; here they have been from their childhood, and have their legs and necks chained so that they cannot move, and can only see before them, being prevented by the chains from turning round their heads." Plato's "punchline" was "...  And if he is compelled to look straight at the light, will he not have a pain in his eyes which will make him turn away to take refuge in the objects of vision which he can see, and which he will conceive to be in reality clearer than the things which are now being shown to him?" ---  --- And so, dear reader The Nation is filled with sunlight that too many Americans cannot stand to look into directly. It is much less painful for them simply to say: "... the Nation's political bias is so far to the Left that it repeatedly errors in its evaluations of the American and world - situation." ---  --- For those who wish to know the simple truth of what is going on in America and the world read The Nation. It prints the patriotic, incisive truth.	pos
Just my two cents, I bought these from the sony store for $15 bucks two years ago, they've lasted me this long for light office use, so at $7/year, this seems to be a good budget earphones.  I'm not an audiophile, so I don't need expensive earphones.  However they did eventually die on me where the cable connects to the jack, the wires got loose and the sound just stopped.

I've been a GTA fan for a few years now and to me, San Andreas has got to be the best one. For the first time you can swim!! I fell into the water accidently and discovered this new action for the character. The graphics are more real making it kind of "funky" controlling the game but after awhile you'll get used to it. The language is terrible (more so in this GTA version) so young kids should avoid this like the plague.	pos
I have many traditional film SLRs including the original Pentax K1000 (fully manual), Canon Rebel XOS and a Canon Elph. When considering digital SLR cameras the Canon Digital Rebel and  the point-and-shoot Canon Digital Elph were at the top of my list. But at $150 less than the Canon Digital Elph, the Casio Exilim  EX-S series is a better buy with the the same features (and in some cases a better execution of the same features). If you're looking for a fun point-and-click camera that will record audio, AVI movie files and digital pictures this is it. It takes about 15 miuntes to read the manual and you're off taking pictures. Pay attention when reading the manual and everything else will seem very intuitive. --- Of all the cameras I have I use this one most often.  ---  --- Other users have complained about the proprietary lithium ion battery but 3rd party equivalents are available right here on the amazon site, you just have to look. My back-up battery was only [...] bucks. San Disk 1GB memory cards are cheap too, [...] online, [...] retail. Last, I agree with many users that a lock switch needs to be developed so that you can keep the camera from accidentally turning on when it's in your pocket -- but remember many cameras have this problem/lack/this feature. I solved my own issues by buying a [...] case with a belt loop	pos

I have been a fan since Valotte. and I like the other reviewers here, can't believe why this cd didn't receive the airplay it deserves!There must have been some politics in there, with Sean's cd coming out on the same day ( Yoko?)

I've been a BW subscriber for 8 years now, and if the magazine stays as good as it currently is, I see at least 60 more years of subscription. ---  --- BW is a very well balanced magazine focusing mainly on business trends and headline news.  A majority of their articles are extremely informative, well written, and objective.  If there is an opinion piece, it is clearly stated as "Commentary".  I enjoy the "Economic Viewpoint" where it alternates between right and left wing economists (Hubbard for Rep., Tyson for Dems).  BW is also forward thinking in writing about trend analysis and disecting what the future may bring.  There is a good snippet of International business.   ---  --- A couple weaknesses of the magazine: --- -Tech & You column.  The guy writes about the same category of gadgets over and over again (mainly PDA & what not).  I would like to see more articles about HDTV, laptops, desktops, software, etc.  Tech & You appears to be written for either a road-warrior or a technophobe. --- -Personal lifestyles section.  Seems like the magazine is catering towards a more upscale crowd, writing about exotic vacations and expensive wines that only either a very rich person or a very debt prone person could afford. ---  --- I also find the magazine to be weak in covering the retail sector.  I'd like to read more full articles about companies average consumers deal with on a weekly basis.  The Kmart/Sears deal was largely overshawdowed. ---  --- All in all, if I could only choose one magazine to receive, this would be the one. ---  ---  ---  --- 	pos
Othello is a difficult production for me to watch at any time. Seeing the horrors of jealousy run amuck to the destruction of innocence is painful at the best of times. In the instance of this production it is even more painful because it is so well done. ---  --- The story of Othello is that of a Venetian general who marries a local daughter of a nobleman. The general happens to be black. In an effort to sabotage the general, Iago undermines the faith of the husband for his wife leading ultimately to the tragedy of her death. While Shakespeare gives motivations for his characters, interpretations and emphases tend to vary. Kenneth Brannagh's production of Othello emphasies Iago as a troublemake who likes to cause trouble simple for the sake of doing so. This production, with Ian McKellan in the role of Iago, puts more emphasis on his desire for revenge in reaction to a perceived slight. Both are accurate portrayals but the former seems to show more delight in "being bad" wheras the latter seems more inclined to "get even". Both are excellent and accurate but the emphasis in this film makes the heaviness of the theme that much more difficult to endure. ---  --- The role of Desdemona is portrayed in this version by Imogen Stubb and she is a delight to watch. She bring an alluring innocence to the role that makes her demise all that much more tragic. So too is the title role played admirably. The problem with Othello is that he is at heart and honorable man but lets his passions rule him and cause him to lash out with devatiging consequence. ---  --- This is a fine performance all around with a difficult play. If you can keep your anger at the antics of the characters in check, it is well worth the time	pos
I have very sensitive skin, a thick beard, and must shave daily.  What a hellacious combination! The Art of Shaving for Sensitive Skin is the best shaving cream I have found...and I have been searching far and wide.  As for the rest of their products...eh, I could take them or leave them...i.e. there are similar products you can acquire much cheaper. --- This shaving cream in particular has no alcohol and all kinds of natural ingredients including a bunch of non-comudegenic (sp?) oils that really protect your skin. 	pos
Too many Christians are ignorant of our rich past.  We know a lot about the 1st Century and the current times, but everything in between is somewhat blank.

I love The Tingler! Each metal tip feels great.  I personally like the COPPER version a little better than the SILVER version.  It's a little gentler and softer but I know some people find it too soft and like the SILVER version instead.  Before the tingler, sometimes I would use one end of my glasses (the end that fits over the ear) but of course my glasses are fragil and I would risk damaging them.  It also feels really good on the back and actually all over, not just on the head	pos
    The first shave seemed good; but the second time did me in with the Fusion. Instead of just one nick, I managed around 3 or 4 nicks at once. But looking at the cost of the replacement cartridges put me into a state of price shock.  ---    I got a Merkur Heavy Duty double edge safety razor & the blades are a huge savings. Merkur blades or Feather double edge blades average 50 cents apiece. The Feather blades are extremely sharp! ---    The Gillette Sensor is more practical for me when in a big hurry. A good old fashioned shave using the double edge safety razor, a badger hair shaving brush, & some Proraso shave cream in the tube is alot more enjoyable & relaxing for me!  ---   ---  ---   	neg
The special was filmed in 1970 and reflected the time period--there's a kind of flower power feel to it but it was well done. Doris and Perry Como's duet together was ok (but Perry seemed to not like Doris flirting with him.) Doris Day has always been under-rated as a singer. Her voice is sheer perfection. It's too bad that Doris didn't do more specials or have a variety/comedy/musical show like Carol Burnett.	pos
CorelDraw was my first foray into vector graphics back when version 3 showed up on my desk at the small "Mom and Pop" screenprinting shop i worked at. Back then, Corel came with OODLES of free fonts, clipart, manuals ... not to mention FREE technical support via a toll-free number. ---  --- i stayed with Corel exclusively until version 10 ... enduring countless patches, bugs and the dreaded "odd-numbered" curse (if you tried version 5 or 7, you feel my pain). Adobe Photoshop was always my photo-editing program of choice ... CorelPhotoPAINT just never quite "did it" for me. ---  --- Industry demands eventually delegated that i delve into Adobe Illustrator. Being already familiar with Adobe Photoshop's features, tools and "look and feel", Illustrator didn't present a huge, overbearing learning curve. In Illustrator, i found the same robust features as CorelDraw ... which wasn't what impressed me about Illustrator. Adobe's intuitive programs, and their ability to interact with one another ... seamlessly ... THAT is what won me over to Illustrator. Illustrator's ability to edit/create PDF's in their native format? WOW! Exporting LAYERED vector files to Photoshop ... with layers INTACT??? WOW!!! (i could go on) ---  --- Now, that being said ... there are STILL things that i prefer in CorelDRAW  compared to Illustrator. The EXTRUDE function in corel is MUCH easier to utilize. The PowerClip function is more user friendly than Illustrator's "make clipping mask" function. The ability to customize/edit/add shortcut keys is an amazing feature. (again ... i could go on) ---  --- In regards to importing and exporting files from other applications, CorelDRAW wins, hands down. It boasts a ROBUST set of import and export filters, my favorite being the .eps import filter which lets you import an .eps while converting the fonts to curves DURING the import. This is a MUST HAVE if you work with an .eps file created on another computer whose fonts you lack. If i had a dollar for every .eps that pulls into Illustrator with fonts blown out ... i'd be independently wealthy. WHY Illustrator has never implemented this is beyond me. ---  --- So, to sum it up ... CorelDRAW is a great program ... but i can't imagine it being my ONLY vector drawing program. Just like in real life, you need a great team. This program, paired with Adobe Creative Suite, meets my needs perfectly	pos

I have searched high and low to find a high-quality sugar free, dairy free chocolate bar that tasted just like the real thing, and I can honestly say that these amazing chocolate bars fit the bill perfectly!  Ross Chocolates has truly done it--I could not tell the difference between these and the kind made with sugar and dairy.  These dark chocolate bars are perfect for anyone looking for a pure, healthy alternative to the standard sugar-laden chocolate bar out there.  I am hypoglycemic, so normal sugary candy isn't an option for me.  These bars, though, have no impact on my blood sugar--in fact, I feel even better after eating them and have no negative reactions whatsoever!  They are also perfect for people who are allergic to dairy (like myself) because they are completely dairy-free.  As an added bonus, each bar contains 3 grams of fiber!  The bars have a wonderul, fresh crunch to them, with none of the strange aftertaste common to some products sweetened with sugar alcohols.  I honestly couldn't tell the difference between these maltitol-sweetened bars and those sweetened by regular sugar.  Enjoy	pos

Yeah, it's a money clip alright.  Going from an overfilled wallet down to a 5 card/cash only clip was surprisingly easy.  I found that I was carrying a whole lot of "stuff" in my wallet that I didn't need and was just causing my wallet to get bigger and bigger. ---  --- With just 5 cards, a couple receipts and a little cash this clip is much more comfortable, easier to manage, and looks a lot better than my old wallet. ---  --- I do agree with the previous reviewer about the clip forcing the cash to bunch up under the clasp when it's closed.  However, it doesn't take long for it to become second nature to keep the cash pulled out a bit before securing it down. ---  --- I haven't used any other money clips so I can't compare this one to others, but if you use a wallet I can say that this is, hands down, my new preference	pos

I was just surfing the shelves at Borders today when I stumbled over Queen Kelly on DVD!  I couldn't believe it. I have just been getting interested in silent films (I'm 18) and of course I'm a Gloria Swanson fan (who isn't?), having seen her brilliant performance in Sunset Blvd. Anyway, I had always heard rumors about Queen Kelly - the incomplete, forgotten masterpiece. I had to pay a whopping [money] for this DVD, but it is definitely a piece of art and worth every penny.    First of all, this film is old. You can hear it creak and moan at times and the orchestra soundtrack has not aged well - let's just say the music is annoyingly intense. But the age of the film just makes it more haunting to watch. The story takes place in the 20s, but you could almost believe it was hundreds of years ago.    Now I want to concentrate on the story and the performances. Gloria Swanson's performance in Queen Kelly has to be one of her best - she was every bit as good in this film as in Sunset Blvd. We can easily see why she was such a huge silent star - her emotions and beauty carry the film just as much as the fascinating story.     This was really melodrama at its best. People tend to forget, I think, that melodrama can be an art form, stressing wistful idealism and instead of cynical realism!  The main event here is the story - wow! It's tragic that the film (and the story) were never finished. But who knows? It's just begging for a megabucks remake with Nicole Kidman. Now that the musicals are back, maybe silents will be next	pos

I've had this digital camera for almost a year. It's the fourth camera I've owned. I spent quite some time searching for a compact camera that I could carry everywhere. Being an amateur photographer (and mostly taking pictures for myself and not others), I didn't want to lug around an extra bag just for my camera. It fits discreetly in your pocket or a small purse (for formal nights out). The size and weight of this camera is its best feature, and this carries through to the newer generations of this camera, too.  ---  --- This has been the perfect camera for everything from selling items on-line to landscape scenery. My pictures have always turned out beautifully, with wonderful color and crispness. I have discovered that the "automatic" lighting feature is not always the most ideal, but you can re-program just about anything on this camera.   ---  --- It's really quite a good camera, and given its price these days with the newer generations out there, it's a steal	pos
It was larger than I expected from the images, thicker too. In my opinion it didn't look as classy as the picture made me believe. ---  --- I was very disappointed that the regular second hand was NOT in fact the large sweeping thin hand, that's actually only for the stop watch. The regular second hand is one of the gimmicky minature dials in the middle. ---  --- Really, with the extra bulk and my dislike of which hands were which, and the cheaper look of the watch in person, I never actually put it on before sending it back	neg

I bought this camera around the beginning of July and have used it several times already.  I've upgrade from a Nikon Coolpix 3200 to this one due to smaller, sleaker size and more megapixels.  This camera takes excellent pictures, in broad daylight as well as in the dark.  Red eye reduction is wonderful, however the flash does go off about 4 or 5 times.  It's not broken... it's supposed to do that for everybody who thinks their camera has a glitch.  Overall, I think this was definitely a good buy and am looking forward to taking the camera on vacation! 	pos
I have been reading about this miracle hair dryer for months in the beauty magazines I read, so I will admit I was very excited to pruchase it. The results however will amaze even the most cynical consumer. My hair has never looked so good when styled at home. True, it looks about the same as what my hairstylist does, but to me that is well worth the moderately high price tag. It was a good buy for me because I spend a lot of money buying a variety of cremes and glosses to make my hair pretty, and now I know it wasn't the products I put in that made my hair look bad, it was the dryer.I was so surprised to notice that even the ends of my hair were shiny, and my ends are sooo fried. The difference is astounding.  ---  --- I bought this dryer in a package with the babyliss straightener, and I would definately recommend that to anyone wanting to buy this dryer. For the same price you can get a free straightener. (A very good one!)	pos

..of little teenage white girls trying to sound like thirty-year-old black women.  First it was Britney Spears, then it was Christina Aguilera, now it's Joss Stone.  The former at least have something going for them; Britney's first album had catchy beats, and even though Aguilera's style is incredibly trashy, she does have enormous vocal power and range if she would only stop trying so hard. ---  --- Try as I might, though, I just don't understand the appeal of Joss Stone.  I didn't buy this album; a friend of mine likes it and I've had to listen to it enough times to want to rip my ears right out of my head.  I don't see what is fresh or original about ripping off Janis Joplin and the generally much more talented black soul singers.  Maybe it's the Rick Astley effect: you don't expect THAT voice coming out of THAT face.  You don't expect a squinty little teenaged blonde to growl and screech like a deranged cat.  But that effect can only take you so far, as Rick Astley himself found out.  ---  --- This album is not only an unpleasant listening experience because of the stupid songs ("Dirty Man" basically just repeats "You're a dirty man..." with very minor variations, along with a great deal of unnecessary caterwauling) and the nails-down-a-chalkboard voice of Stone herself - it's a depressing reminder of how low our culture has sunk, when it can't come up with any culture based on its own heritage but slavishly copycats things from another culture that seems more "cool".  Stone, like Aguilera and Spears, tries to sing like an older black woman, a woman with soul - an Aretha Franklin or a Gloria Gaynor.  But Stone et al. sound like little girls clattering around in grown-up shoes.  They haven't been alive long enough to live similar experiences of the women they are trying to imitate.  Their singing rings hollow to me, show-offy and fake. ---  --- Stone could rival Aguilera in shameless and unnecessary vocal theatrics, though she has nowhere near Aguilera's sweetness or range.  Her voice might be described as "smoky" by some; to me it sounds gravelly, sandpapery, and as pleasant as scraping your knees on asphalt. ---  ---  I don't understand why anyone in the right mind would willingly put themselves through the ordeal of listening to this CD, much less enjoy it.  I guess fake is good enough for some people.  It makes me chuckle, though, to hear people rave about her voice as "authentic".    ---  --- If you're looking for soul, try Macy Gray.  She's for real.  Try the hugely talented but woefully ignored Tasmin Archer and Karen Rodriguez.  Those are fresh, authentic voices that will make you realize what a load of bollocks Joss Stone and her ilk truly are. ---  --- The only white woman I have ever heard who could sing like she was black was Linda Ronstadt.  Go back and listen to a Ronstadt classic like "Hurts So Bad" and compare it to this modern-day drivel.  Ronstadt sang with real feeling, real knowledge, real pain - worlds apart from this fake plastic imitation of soul that seems to be the rule and not the exception these days.   ---  --- I gave this one star because there is no zero-stars option.  Joss Stone is just a musical Chav, an unconvincing shoplifter of another, better culture	neg
Most reviewers on this site are unenthusiastic about this particular product.  I think the main reason for that level of dissatisfaction is, as someone else suggested, that people need to pay attention to how, exactly, this trimmer works.  Because of its design, best results are obtained when it is inserted, withdrawn, then inserted again, and the procedure repeated.  Second tip: rinse the rotating blade, switched ON, under the HOT tap to remove accumulated hair, etc, after each use.  It works better when clean. ---  --- The main PLUS of this product is its size.  Yes, it is flimsy, made in China, and would probably sell for $2.50 if it didn't say Panasonic on it - or come with a 12-month Panasonic warranty.  But it works very well if you use it right and keep it clean. I have had mine a couple of years and the only problem is that the blade is now dull and replacement blades are apparently not available	pos
I have two iPods that don't work.  I bought a shuffle first and that has an error that I can't fix and Apple can't fix.  So, I thought I'd buy 1GB iPod a year later and that broke down even with a new computer.  So, this time I made the right decision and bought the 30 GB Zune.  Wow!  The Zune is so much better!  It has such a better feel to it and the controls react nicely, instead of making you frustrated like the iPod.  The screen is perfect.  Sound quality is excellent.  5 Stars for the Zune. 	pos

The Schwinn Airdyne is built to last out of steel. For upper and lower body workout, it uses a fan/flywheel to create resistance rather than a friction belt or magnetic motor; hint--fewer repairs and failures since there is no friction mechanism to fail. ---  --- The onboard computer allows your to select what information you wish to see such as mets, calories, distance, speed, rpm and even displays your pulse if you wear a chest strap.  You can select miles or kilometers for distance and "club or home" for setup; hint--built to withstand use in a fitness center/health club. It even allows you to imput your geological elevation to facilitate a more accurate calorie count. ---  --- Assembly is straight foward but does require a few basic tools such an adjustable wrench and phillips screwdriver. ---  --- This represents a good way to go if you want a well built durable piece of equipment intended for serious use to achieve your goal of cardio-vascular conditioning, weight loss or just plain old exercise	pos

I love the texture of the coffee.  There is no bitterness and it is very smooth - to where I didn't need cream to cut the flavor.  I am usually not a coffee drinker but a friend told me that this is one of the best she ever had.  This was intended to be a christmas gift for her but out of curiosity I bought one for myself to include with the  7 bags for her.  I now know the difference!  Believe me, I had thought that instant tasted way better then "real" coffee until a I had a cup of this java.  I was almost tempted not to give the rest of the coffee away. ---  --- Also, the shipment was very fast!  I had ordered this with other items (books and DVDs).  The coffee came in within the week but the other items didn't come in at all.  Infact every time I checked the progress, amazon kept pushing the items further away in the shipment date.

I got talked into buying this at the Fresh boutique in Las Vegas.  First, it's very expensive - $38, forgivable if it were outstanding.  It's not even good.  The wand isn't well made, and the product does clump on it, and then it clumps eyelashes rather than lengthen them.  I have tried all week to make this purchase work out for the best, but to no avail.  The worst part is, at the end of the day if I happen to rub my eyes, it smears - racoon eyes.  I've been using Physicians formula and Revlon with the primer both are exponentially better, and I could have purchased eight of them for the cost of Supernova.  On the positive side, it washes off easily and completely with soap and water.	neg
Adobe has totally re-done the interface to streamline it and make it cleaner from versions prior to CS.  If you are a QuarkXpress user, you'll find that in InDesign CS2, you get the feeling that it is laid out in a logical and easy-to-use manner.  The tools and tool palettes are where you'd expect them to be in the menu structure and on the screen.  Small touches like being able to save your workspace, like you can do in Photoshop CS2, are great. ---  --- I tested the integration between InDesign CS2 and some of its counterparts in the Adobe Creative Suite Premium.  I created different graphics in Photoshop CS2 and Illustrator CS2 and I found it was really easy to import them into InDesign CS2 and use.  You can effects like drop shadows and feathering to images directly in InDesign CS2.  No need to go to another program.  With the Control Palette you can also resize objects too.  This palette functions with Transform and Stroke features for graphics, and it includes paragraph, character and table features for text editing.  What the palette does is affected by the type of selection you have made - either graphic or text.  ---  --- I imported some formatted text in from Microsoft Word 2003 and two different tables in from Microsoft Excel 2003.  I was concerned how the tables would appear after the import from Microsoft Excel.  The tables imported easily. With InDesign CS2, you can now automatically style Microsoft Word files on import by mapping Word styles to InDesign CS2 styles as well. ---  --- An issue for a long time has been how to preview or view other types of files that you want to incorporate with InDesign CS2.  Now, Adobe "bridges" that gap.  Bridge now comes as a part of InDesign CS2 and the Premium Suite.  So, viewing any Adobe-type formatted file or standard graphic format is easy to do.  Using the same interface between the different programs is a help as well.  Adobe Bridge is a standalone program. ---  --- Being a Web Designer and using Adobe (formerly Macromedia) Dreamweaver 8, I was familiar with using Snippets.  These are portions of code you can save for use in other programs or you can export them to give to someone else.  Now,  InDesign CS2 offers this Snippet capability.  You can export objects as snippets. These objects can be shared or reused in other documents. Simply place or drag a snippet into a layout, and  InDesign re-creates the original objects, their formatting, and their relative positioning on the page.  No more wasted time redesigning, just to get something you have brought in from another document to fit. ---  --- InDesign CS2 also now has an Info palette that is just like those found in Photoshop and Illustrator.  Size dimensions and resolution are immediately available by selecting the graphic and simply glancing over to the Info palette.  This is a crucial tool when fitting graphics in a specifically space-limited area.  It's important to know the actual dimensions with which you are working. ---  --- Sometimes in designing and re-designing printed work, you have to move objects.  When this happens, your structure can often change in different ways.  InDesign CS2 helps you maintain your layout by allowing you to anchor your callouts, pull quotes, margin notes, and graphics to text. You can now precisely control the positioning of Anchored Objects, apply text wrap settings, and more. ---  --- As with other Adobe products, it is very easy to export your finished work in PDF format.  InDesign CS2 works so well at exporting to PDF, it even maintains the layers in Acrobat 7.  You can pre-define your Acrobat export settings as well.  InDesign CS2 also supports specialty PDF formats like PDF/X-1a and PDF/X-3, which are used in workflows.  It also supports high-resolution CMYK output and color-managed workflows. ---  --- If you are familiar with previous versions of InDesign, the upgrade to the new version is easy.  InDesign CS2 is even backwards compatible CS.  You will find that your learning curve is greatly decreased. ---  --- Loren Elks, Group Manager --- D-MAG.or	pos
I bought this for my son's fourth birthday because he's a superhero nut. It's a cute toy except for one critical flaw: it doesn't come anywhere near fitting around the waist of my average-sized 4-year-old (wears a size 4T). I'm talking about three inches of waist gap on even the smallest setting. Yet the belt can be adjusted to a size that would fit a teenager. If you have a 9-year-old who loves running around in a Batman costume, go for it. As for my 4-year-old, he still plays with it sometimes, but we keep it on him with a pair of firefighter's suspenders. ---  --- Update: The thick plastic of the belt is now ripped halfway apart. We've only had it two months, and he's hardly played with it for the abovementioned reasons. Not so great for Batman, but perfect for playing Super Chintzy Toy Man	neg
The Sundays come out with a CD once a decade, thus putting me in constant cravings for new material.

***** --- I liked this film a lot.  It was entertaining, suspenseful, and made me think.  It's staying with me and I'm continuing to think about it.   ---  --- "A Simple Plan" asks the question, "What if you found $4.4 million in a gym bag in the woods...would you keep it...what if you thought there was a reasonably good chance you'd never get caught...that no one would ever know?"  This is what happens to the central characters.  The DVD cover advertises, "Sometimes good people do evil things."  Once they make their decision, and plan their plan, the movie illustrates how consequences happen that are completely unanticipated.   ---  --- Bill Paxton plays the main character and is wonderful as a typical "good" middle-class accountant in a small rural town.  Bridget Fonda does an excellent job as his wife, who is very idealistic and moralistic until she realizes that the scenario is not hypothetical---in fact, she has to decide what to do, and she makes decisions different from what I would have expected.  Billy Bob Thornton is predictably great, of course, playing a rural man (the main character's brother) who has never had a chance in the town he lives in and just wants to truly have a life, and in his own way, do what is right; he is handicapped, however, by his intelligence, his eccentricity, and his background.  I felt a lot of sympathy for his character, and since I'm a person more like his brother, it was fascinating to see how he lived and thought...as the movie progressed, his middle-class brother gained empathy for the difficult life he led, too.   ---  --- I didn't think that any of the pacing was slow, as other reviewers have said.  I thought that the starkness and the pacing fit in beautifully with the movie and it gave me a chance to process what was going on.  One moral decision led to another, and each of them made me think "Would I do that?" and "Could I do that?"  It made me see how seductive certain crimes in certain circumstances can be to any one of us. ---  --- This is a quality, very suspenseful, provocative film.  I think it would be equally enjoyable for men and women but definitely not for children at all, as the themes are very heavy and mature.   ---  --- There are no special features or subtitles.  I generally like subtitles, but they are not necessary in this film for hearing people, as everyone speaks very clearly.   ---  --- I cannot imagine how anyone would dislike this movie.  There is some violence, but none of it is gratuitous.  I generally really dislike violence in movies, but it was worth it for the experience I took away after watching it. --- ***** 	pos
My son is 5yrs old and this was one of the 1st things on his christmas list. He loves Power Rangers of all kinds but when we finally opened this and I tried to put it together...I thought I was doing it wrong b/c nothing fit or stayed together!! My son still played with the dragon part that was already put together but the storage bin is useless and the rope that the Power Ranger can "slide" down is barely high enough that he stays off of the ground and he pretty much falls down rather than sliding down. The so called "instructions" were horrible and another reviewer was correct in indicating how small the pictures were. I would have never wasted my money on this if I would have read the reviews 1st (I usually do). My son played with it for about 5-10 minutes and then asked why santa would bring him something like that. In my opinion it was a huge waste of about $50 and gave santa a bad name with my son for bringing him such a piece of junk	neg
 The military courtroom drama,"A Few Good Men" is one of those films, that through endless cable showings seems to have taken a life of it's own. But even with countless viewings it retains it's emotional power and speaks to us about issues, that have become more important than ever. In the film we meet Lt. Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise) a young successful, military lawyer, who is considered so slick at plea bargaining out cases, that supposably he's "never even seen the inside of a courtroom". He is assigned the cases of PFC Louden Downey (James Marshall) and Lance Cpl. Harold Dawson (Wolgang Bodison). They are accused of murder and a host of other charges, when at the Guantanamo Bay military base they performed a "Code Red" (an illegal form of discipline within a military unit) on Pvt. William Sandiago, which unintentionally resulted in his death. While the two accused Marines admit they did the "Code Red", both claim they were under orders to do so by their superiors, which includes Base Commander, Col. Nathan Jessup (a brillaint Jack Nicholson) a powerful, highly decorated officer, who is being groomed for one of the top slots in the military command. With both time running out and a lack of legal evidence, Kaffee must get to the bottom of a conspiracy and present his case, even if it means putting his own career in jeopardy. Through a brilliant script (based on the play by Aaron Sorkin), Rob Reiner's steady direction and the cast's dynamic performances this film looks at the meaning of highly held military principles such as "code, honor & discipline". Should a soldier always follow orders no matter what? Whats' more important our ethics & principles (on which this country was founded) or our need for security? Is Col. Jessup right? Can we not "handle the truth"? It's hard to believe, that this film was made way back in 1992. In this post 9/11, post Abu Grebbe world, where our country is on a war footing the questions, that the film seeks to address have become more profound and important than ever. The film is filled with great performances. While I am not normally a huge Tom Cruise fan, I have to admit, that Cruise does a wonderful job as the young conflicted lawyer. The same goes for the great supporting cast which includes good acting turns from Demi Moore, Kevin Bacon and Kiefer Sutherland. But what really propels and turns this film into a classic is the brilliant, dynamic performance, that comes from Jack  Nicholson. When Cruise puts Nicholson on the courtroom stand and starts pointly egging him on, you just watch in awe as Nicholson just continually builds the character's palpable anger, until he just boils over and explodes in the now infamous "You Can't Handle the Truth" speech. Even though the speech and Nicholson's performance has been endlessly quoated & parodied, when you put it in the context of this movie it still has so much power and resonance. If you are interested in seeing a well made, movie courtroom drama, that is both thought provoking and entertaining then I highly recommend "A Few Good Men"	pos

I am a huge fan of most of the Tasty Bite meals. I'd tried almost all of the Indian flavors and had never been let down. I ordered the Green Curry meal without ever having tried it before based on the good reviews here and my past experiance. Unfortuantly, I found it to be nearly inedible. The rice is clumpy and unpleasant and the spicing was just... wrong. I love Thai Green Curry, and this tasted nothing like it. I still recommend the Indian Tasy Bite Meals, but track a box of this down and sample it before you commit to a pack of 6.	neg

this comedy, like Click has a funny side to it and then switches to a darker side half way through. the characters in this film can be hated at points, especially Michael Douglas' and Matt Dillon's but there is a lighter side! Owen Wilson is very likeable as Dupree, an unemployed party guy who is in need of love and a good paying job. the cast is fine and one of the strength's in this film! however, I think it gets too serious at points. this is supposed to be a comedy after all.

I was not sure what to expect upon receiving a box of this tea as a gift during the holiday season, and indeed the ingredients struck me as rather unusual.  Being a person who generally likes my tea and coffee black with no flavoring whatsoever, I was rather suspicious of the orange, grapefruit, and other extra 'scents'.  However, I was delighted with the concoction.  The extras are definately present, giving a slightly citric quality to the tea but are not the least bit overpowering and provide a unique  aroma that is quite pleasing.   ---  --- I do recommend steeping it for a long time to get the most out of the leaves, especially if you are to get the citric scents that make it so unique. 	pos

I don't know how I did with out them for so long. ---  --- Get a couple of pairs you'll love them.

It is almost ashame that North Amercian culture needs Bill Maher. ---  --- After all, shouldn't honest yet entertaining social commentary be a little bit more available then it currently is? On Victory Begins At Home, Maher creates entertainment by basically speaking his mind. ---  --- Maher's central premise that the War On Terrorism can be aided by what people do in the United States really is almost a common sense arguement. Yet Maher is so uniquely unapologetic about what he says and how he presents it, the commentary and comedy bristle with an energy that few comedians can match.  ---  --- Maher does this by not pretending he isn't politically opinated, in fact that is what bases his comedy completely on, the rarity of straight-forward unabashed opinion. ---  --- On Victory Begins At Home he is more Democrat then Republican, but he openly sides with neither. Instead, he rails at all presenting himself as a full person, neither liberal nor conservative, right-wing or left-wing. ---  --- The end result is an engaging and unique look at culture that seems unfiltered. There is no spin here, what Maher realizes is that no spin is funny in a world full of it. With all the spin that is normally doled out by the news media, political columnists and special interest groups, know wonder we need him so much. ---  ---  --- 	pos
I use Print Works CD/DVD envelopes and was worried when I ordered this product that the envelopes wouldn't fit top-up which is important for me because I label the tops of my envelops to make looking through them easier. The envelopes are just a hair over 5" wide and they fit into these storage boxes perfectly. There is just enough room on either side to make flipping through the dvds easy. I ordered four of these and am glad I did. I keep them on a shelf side-by-seide and the make a perfect card-catalog-type filing systemfor all my dvds. I will most definately be ordering up more of these when I need more room; these boxes are great. If you use a 5" wide envelope, rest assured that these boxes are just the right size to fit all your dvds.	pos

The literature describes this unit as a flat-mount ski rack compatible with any factory-installed roof rack with crossbars.  Hardly. ---  --- My vehicle is a 2006 GMC Envoy with a factory roof rack.  This rack is the same one used on many GM SUVs, so great numbers of them are out there.  These racks have crossbars with a "reverse wing" shape that are tilted forward, presumably to reduce wind noise.  The Thule "universal" mounting system will not conform to these crossbars, and will only mount with the ski rack tilting forward (or backward) at a silly angle.  It can be used in this conformation, but it looks odd. ---  --- Also, the ski rack indeed locks over the skis/boards, but the mounts are not lock-protected, so the entire ski rack and contents can be easily stolen with standard wrenches. ---  --- My searches found no alternative to this rack, however, and it does work for the intended purpose	neg

Intermezzo is, without question, my very favorite magazine. I think it's the best magazine on the market; most beautiful, most interesting, and has the best recipes. Have already made several recipes from the new issue and they are phenomenal, and pretty simple too. Particularly loved the pear nectar punch which I served at my Christmas party, as well as the saffron chicken which I have already made 3 times. I used to alternate subscribing to Bon Appetit and Gourmet but have let those lapse. Have given it as a gift to several friends who love it as well. Any time I have had a change of address or customer service question, I have been pleased and astonished with the personal and prompt attention of the staff, even once the publisher heself. I think Intermezzo is a small company putting out a world class publication. I do wish it came out more often though as I would love to see more of it.	pos
This magazine single-handedly taught me how to dress with style- and believe me- that's no small feat. I love how Lucky shows  how to put pieces together to look fabulous without mindlessly following the crowd. If that's all I had interest in, then I could've simply bought the Lucky shopping guide book.  But their reviews of up and coming clothing and jewelry designers, hair, makeup, home decor, and the "How I'm Wired" sections keep me coming back to the magazine.  Plus the Lucky Breaks are awesome.  My only complaint is the average price of their featured raved-about items.  What Lucky is for me is a fantastic template for fashion and style that I can use to find similar items at cheaper prices in stores like H&M, Target, etc.  It's so worth the $12/year, and I look anxiously at the beginning of each month for its arrival in my mailbox	pos

I had to do a bit of research to figure out which would be best (not having much experience in this area) and was very happy I did!  This mic comes pretty highly rated on all pod casting sites for the price and (after using it with Dragon Naturally Speaking 9), I can see why.  I use it to do term papers and it is great!  It is an excellent mic with very solid construction.  Only negative thing (although very minor) I wish I had know that I could have gotten a standard mic stand for it instead of the "fancy" "spider" or "cage" design advertised with it (you really don't need that).  Lastly, no worries with the usb/windows set up.  Literally took it out of the package, plug in and go!  Again a great item	pos

I have been a long-time radiohead fan and, like many others, have been waiting patiently for a live DVD.  So I was thrilled to find out they released one and immediately bought it without even looking at the setlist.  It never occurred to me that they would release material that is nearly 10 years old!   ---  --- I couldn't help being disappointed when I watched this DVD.  The constantly changing camera angles and general lack of concern for the song itself make this unpleasant to watch.  In fact, I only watched it once and it has since been gathering dust.  I know I would have enjoyed it much more had it come out when the songs were still in their prime.   ---  --- I've always that Radiohead was modern, progressive, and totally innovative.   I appreciate their old music but they have come a long way since pablo honey... and it doesn't help that before every song, Thom mutters "this is a new one." 	neg
I got it on sale for $88.00 thinking it would be a great bargain at that price. I feel I was ripped off. The video quality is ghastly when given enough light, and absolutely unusable without. The same goes for the pictures. Even at highest quality - and a lot of image enhancements, the results are mediocre. The audio portion of the video had a very noticeable hum, which I was able to remove with my audio editing software. Otherwise, the audio recording and playback were "acceptable," at best. This device is useful only as an audio recorder/MP3 player, and is not really a bargain	neg

My husband purchased this bag for me when I recently took a trip solo with my daughter. It seemed to be more troublesome than helpful. I ended up using the backpack strap to pull the bag because I could not pull using the regular strap in a comfortable positition. On the 1st flight the bag ripped at the seam on the bottom from scraping on the floor. When I arrived at my destination I restitched the bag and thought that maybe I had been careless in my handling. On the return flight we had to do more walking since the airport was a little bigger, though it was still a small airport. When I arrived at my destination the bag had completely separated along the bottom stitch and my car seat base had been scratched and mared as a result. The damage to the bag is so bad that I can never use it again. This bag should be labeled as disposable. Though this is a good concept there needs to be better planning on the overall design and quality. I would NOT recommend this product and will think twice before purchasing any other products from this manufacturer	pos

After switching from Mac OS to Windows a few years ago, I needed a PC-oriented magazine to get me well versed in the new vernacular.  I took a look at PC Magazine and was disgusted by the number of errors and the dearth of useful content; man, I thought, this is why Mac users laugh at PC guys.  Then I picked up PC World at the suggestion of a friend and, wow, within minutes I filled out the subscription card and sent for my subscription. ---  --- PC World is good because it's informative and useful.  It covers things you want to know as a PC user.  It does not slant toward hardware (like the modders-only Maximum PC) or software, and it doesn't waste space telling you why you should buy a Mac G5, which, oddly enough, PC Mag tries to do.  PC World is a well-balanced, informational magazine for general PC users.  If you want more expert-oriented stuff you might want things like Windows Mag or other more specific magazines, but for general computing, PC World is the best.  Each issue is packed with stuff you can use, either in your daily computing or to impress your friends at the new year's party	pos

First published in 1936, this is the 12th Poirot book, the 3rd Superintendent Battle book, and the 2nd Colonel Race book, and has no narrator. It's the first case in which Superintendent Battle, Mrs. Oliver, or Col. Race appear together with Poirot or each other, and the only case in which *all* do so at once. ---  --- The story opens at an exhibition of snuffboxes, where Poirot encounters Mr. Shaitana, a collector with a catty manner and a knack for gossip. Shaitana deliberately cultivates a Mephistopholean pose, which at first makes him seem like the potential quarry in the case - but it becomes clear that he's a victim waiting to happen. ---  --- For Shaitana, like a few other collectors in Christie's universe, has succumbed to a foolish temptation, and begun collecting *people* - and not just people of talent or genius, but murderers. And being a connoisseur, he collects only the best: those who have gotten away with it. He amuses himself on this occasion by boasting to Poirot of his hobby, without naming names, and inviting him to a little supper party to meet his collection of "tigers" (Poirot having just pointed out that he himself could admire a tiger, but would do so from outside the tiger's cage, having respect for the danger.) ---  --- Poirot accepts the supper invitation, however, to find that there are seven other guests, including the three other detectives as well as four guests who are presumably the murderers: explorer Major Despard, a strong silent type; Mrs. Lorrimer, a middle-aged widow who is *very* serious about bridge; timid young Anne Meredith; and Dr. Roberts, a loud and jovial general practitioner. ---  --- Shaitana drops hints referring to four possible methods of murder, but otherwise the subject does not come up, and the guests proceed to play bridge after supper - arising from the final game to find their host dead, stabbed sitting beside the fire in full view of the players! ---  --- This is, of course, Poirot's fantasy case, as he once remarked in THE ABC MURDERS - because there is no tangible evidence against any one person more than another. There are only the people themselves, and their memories of the evening, and the bridge scores reflecting how the evening progressed. Solving the case depends entirely on being able to understand the people involved. But how to get them to reveal their true selves to an interrogator - or to uncover the crimes that Shaitana believed they'd committed and gotten away with? ---  --- Rather than following Poirot's viewpoint in third person throughout, some chapters follow Battle, Race, or Mrs. Oliver as they conduct their own enquiries into the case. Each represents a different style: Battle is a professional police officer, Race an empire-builder-type secret agent, and Mrs. Oliver a writer of detective stories. Battle, of course, has a duty to investigate Shaitana's murder, and does so in an orthodox style, cultivating an image of plodding hard work that tempts one to underestimate him. Race deals with checking out Major Despard, the explorer who's most clearly his kind of person. Mrs. Oliver, for her part, works on worming information out of not only Anne Meredith, but her roommate Rhonda (whose attitude is that Anne could've lived like a duchess for the rest of her life on blackmail if she'd been paying attention). ---  --- And, of course, there's Poirot. He's really fascinating to watch in this one as he interacts with each suspect in turn, pursuing two major lines of questioning: --- (1) Describe how the bridge games played out, and --- (2) Describe the scene of the murder (the elaborate collector's room in Shaitana's house where the bridge games were played). ---  --- See if you can figure out where Poirot's questions lead before he reveals his reasoning to his colleagues, and what he learned from the responses he received	pos
ridiculous plot, one dimensional cardboard-like acting (especially leon lai's rigid dead-like-fish-out-of-water performance), incoherent dialogs, horrible editing and directing, every thing is so bad if compares it to the first one. the second one has already turned bad but not as bad as this 3rd increment. the screen writers were obsessed with abnormal twists of the plots and tried to twist every section of the scenario to the extreme but unfortunately almost messed up the logic flow of a storyline. nothing deep but shallow all the way. just like a magician overplayed his black magic and suddenly found himself exposed completed without white gloves, long sleeves, and black cloak, even the white pigeons turned out to be dead. nothing could be hidden up in his sleeves or the tall hat. nothing at all. curtain call, drop it sooner than later.	neg
I have not heard of or listened to, this cd series, but from the sound of it, its all bad interpretations of popular music.  I just want to say that if you want your kids to listen to music and you want to steer clear of the bad stuff... play classical music.  Play stuff without lyrics.  Play a show on tv where the characters sing.  Do anything but, buy a cd where people that aren't the original artists sing songs that were never intended to be for kids in the first place.  Censoring a song or cutting lyrics tends to ruin that song.  There are just some songs that aren't good for kids even if you cut out all the bad words.  Think about this... do you really want your kids coming up to you later in their life after hearing the real version of a song and asking you why the song they heard as a kid is so different from the one they just heard on the radio and then having to explain to them that the song they heard as a kid was a clean version of the song?  Listen... I'm all for trying to keep your kids away from inappropriate stuff for as long as possible, but cds like this are not the way to go.  All they do is make kids think that all music is going to sound just like the music on the cds and when they finally hear the real stuff, they're gonna be asking questions.  Do them and yourself a favor and don't buy these cds	neg

Upgrading from the Treo 650, it is true that there isn't much new. Also issues such as the horrible battery duration and non-megapixel camera leave one frustrated.

This book is for readers with little or no knowledge of recent debates on energy security, global warming, etc. as well as related technological advances in fields such as hydrogen and fuel cells. The author contributes little to previous books on the subject, such as Rikin's book on hydrogen which is much better researched and just as accesible to the general public. If anything, the book's original contribution is to discuss how energy and environmental issues can be addressed using market mechanisms. In doing so, the author comes up with some interesting case studies, but it's quite obvious he is biased toward the same tired free-market ideology that is endlessly promoted in the pages of The Economist, which happens to be the author's employer. Moreover, there was little effort in integrating the various chapters. Overall, a very disapointing book. The author should stick to journalism	neg

At first it took me awhile to figure out how to get the device to control the drums in Impulse (Ableton Live) once I realized that each pad had to be set in order to have each tone mapped it was a breeeze. I suspect that maybe the first reviewer as well as any midi newbie might have difficulty in that respects since it is not plug in play as M Audio states....it is program and play, however once you get it programmed correctly it is effortless. The htinkg is it is soo expandable and programmable it may be to its own detriment especaiily for peolle who are not fimiliar with mapping out midi controllers	pos

I received these earrings as a Christmas gift from my sister.  They are perfect.  Their size is about the circumference of a dime.  Platinum adds elegance and yet, they are perfect for simple everyday wear.  You know they will never tarnish nor will they irritate your ears.  They are also perfect for young lady's first introduction to platinum jewelry. 	pos

There's nothing outrageous about the title song - it's a lame, mind-numbing piece of crap compared to many other songs found on the "In the Zone" album: Imagine "Breathe on Me", "Touch of My Hand" or "Shadow" on constant radio play or running on MTV. And no, we're not apparently going to have that because Britney's precious time was wasted in incorporating this bore of a song into a single and even attempting a video out of it, like we know ended up in Britney's injury. For nothing.  --- Fortunately for this single, it's got the already legendary "Toxic" and a marvelous vocal mix version of "Everytime" - another star for that.  	neg
Great story!!  Excellent in fact.  My beef is with the narrator and editor: ---  --- As someone who grew up in the Baltimore area, I thoroughly enjoyed the local references.  However, it is frustrating to hear the narrator mispronounce Baltimore icons, like Boog's BBQ at Camden Yards.  For the record, it is NOT pronounced Bow-g!  It is Boo-g... Do better research!!	pos
I encourage many to stay away from this usb product; like previous reviewers said, just spend the extra money on a better usb dongle. As soon as i got this thing out of its package, i almost snapped the casing off due to its poor construction.   --- The main problem that i have experienced with this product is that although its range is ok(not the 100 meters that it claims), as soon as i go into a room thats only 10 feet away, has doors or walls in the way, the reception starts to fluctuate in and out every 2 minutes.	neg
This series of diagnostic tools does not handle ABS.  I am not certain why ... whether the reason is merely a lack of software/firmware support for ABS or a physical interface issue. ---  --- Regardless, this tool has an easy to use menu structure and connectors for any imaginable vehicle	pos
I LOVE everything about these sops!!!  They are luxurious and delicious at the same time......one thing I need to indulge in. --- The scents last for days after you've used them.....my bathroom still smells like a mix of verbena and honey-almond!!!! Just scrumptious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Not to mention how your skin smells and feels afterwards! --- These are amazing soaps that EVERYONE should use.  I feel exquisite using them and the gift sets are a fabulous thing to give to friends or even aquaintences.  They are sure to think of how thoughtful you were to give it to them everytime they use this wonderful soap!!!!!! 	pos
I purchased one and was so pleased that I bought another.  Keeps liquids hot for hours, much better than the Thermos I had.  Wash by hand - do NOT put it in the dishwasher or it will lose its thermal effectiveness (voice of experience)	pos
Pinback BLOWS me away.  I consider my taste in music to be very diverse, with a tendency to love obscure indie rock-pop, from the last three decades (talk talk, split enz to elliot smith and death cab).  Pinback delivers some of the best, most consistent music I've heard in YEARS.  I started with Summer in Abaddon and was weak in the knees, then I acquired their debut album and could barely stand...and now, Blue Screen Life has about knocked the breath right out of me.  I haven't gotten through the entire back catalog because I can't stop listening to the three albums I have in my hands.  Words cannot express how fascinating this band is - intricate & complicated with a simple, straightforward delivery.  Their transitions are SICK.  They put their contemporaries (death cab, the shins, the killers) to SHAME.  I love all of the aforementioned bands, but Pinback slaughters them in delivering well conceived, perfectly executed, diversified albums that you can listen to from front to back, over & over.  How many albums can you say that about?  They are heavenly.  The standouts are XIY, Boo, Concrete Seconds, Bbtone, Prog, Pene... oh, screw it - every song is GREAT! --- 	pos
I recently decided to become vegetarian, so I got this book to read. I was very disapointed. I think this book provides good information about nutrional and meals, yet is written in a boring, scientific way. This book may appeal more to parents of vegetarians and vegans and adult vegetarians, than to teenagers. This book contains a lot of recipies, and some of them sound good, but most of them are far more complex than a teenager would be willing to cook. I would reccomend this book to parents of teenage vegetarians, but there are better books written for the teens themself. This book also has so many negative quotes including a whole page of someone making fun of vegetarian food and rambling about how they hate tofu. I don't think these are nessecary in a book for vegetarians, there is enough of that without reading about it. However, if you seriously want to research about being a vegetarian this book won't hurt, it is just a dissapointment	neg

A little known documentary that is both entertaining and informative. Touching first hand accounts and rare footage that give an extraordinary look at both Mr. Welles and the Brazilian culture. If there is one reason  to own this tape it would be to see over and over again the last part of  the film. A piece called "Four Men on a Raft" It is the most  beautiful black and white short film I have ever seen. The love Mr. Welles  had for these poor fishermen is so wonderfully apparent	pos
Purchased this so my 7-year old can wake up on his own for school.  I checked several stores and was dissapointed to find nothing suitable for a child (didn't want radio, CD, telephone, and other features). ---  --- ** Pros ** --- 1. Very compact size, fits good next to bed --- 2. AC adapter with battery backup (even came with batteries) --- 3. LCD display doesn't have annoying illumination while trying to sleep.  Blue "glow" activates only when very easy to find button is pressed --- 4. Straight forward buttons and controls that took about 2-3 minutes for my 7-year old to learn.  Buttons are a good size and are not real hard to press. --- 5. Great styling as a kids clock --- 6. The projection feature is a BIG hit.  Projects about 4" high numbers on ceiling. --- 7. Projection intensity is good for laying in bed at night without lighting up the whole room --- 8. Decent construction for the $$$ ---  --- ** Cons ** --- 1. None for my particular application --- NOTE: If you are looking for a projection clock to use during the day (visible projection in sunlight), you will be extremely disappointed	pos
I purchased this toy for my 3yr old in December last year. He has not been able to use it since we have not been able to find ANY products (discs, carrying case etc) for the videonow. I have called the company several times. Everything is always unavailable and I do check on a regular basis. My son has been watching black and white discs recently from his older brother on the machine so he will get some use out of it. It was a good idea but the company leaves a lot to be desired. If you make a product make sure that there are enough discs. It is simply a waste of money and time. I cannot continue going on line and checking a couple of times every week. I hope this info factors in in your decision to purchase this toy	neg
I would give this toy a 0 if it was an option.  When you unfold the tiny track and get the train going, it can't even make one corner turn without coming off the track!  The train is too big for the sharp corners and it either sticks or completey comes off the track.  This is very frustrating for my kids and I cannot believe they even put this on the market?  You can't even get it to stay in the track when you manually push it.  I am just bummed that we threw away the box before we put in batteries and saw how bad this toy really is. ---  --- We wanted this toy for portability.  Our kids also have the GeoTrax Working Railway, which is awesome, but not as portable	neg
I love this purse! I just wish I could get it in the emerald color, too. I have the magenta.	pos
This fragrance took me quite by surprise when I first tried it from a magazine sample, so much so that I knew I had to try it at a department store - this was a little over a year ago. Then I sampled it at a department store and all my nose could think was "Wow!" - gardenias from my grandmother's garden, the suntan oils & tropical perfumes that I smelled as a little girl at the beach, with a few more florals blended in that make this fragrance even more exotic and sensual - I knew I had to have it! I bought myself a bathgel and lotion set and put the large bottle of cologne on my X-mas list, which my sweet & generous boyfriend got for me.  --- In my opinion, this is probably the most alluring fragrance for women that I have ever smelled. I feel very alluring every time I wear it for my boyfriend - and he loves it! So this would be a great gift for a man's wife or girlfriend, or for a woman's best friend, sister or cousin (as long as you wear it for your own man, too!), but a slightly awkward gift to give to your mother, aunt or grandmother - it's that enticing. But if your single older relative or friend simply must have it as one of her gifts, then have it given by one of her female friends, sister, cousin or "Santa". That way there won't be any awkwardness at gift-giving time. Believe me - this fragrance is the olfactory equivalent of French lingerie or a string bikini! 	pos
I bought this kit as a gift for my boyfriend's birthday and was impressed with the quality (and size) of the items.  I did a bit of research for the perfect "starter kit" and thought this to be a good choice.  It has the basic essentials, a descriptive and helpful instruction book, and a few extras.  He was quite impressed and had fun opening all the individually bubble wrapped items!  We can't wait to pick up some sushi grade fish and get started.  One item to note, I spent some time looking through the book that was included and feel that this will be a great help in the process... simple steps, good instructions, and great photos	pos

My previous phone was the Motorola V60i with a monochrome screen with Cingular, so I am still getting used to all the differences in phone capabilities and have barely scratched the surface of what the i560 can do.  Here's a breakdown of the pros and cons so far (after a week). ---  --- PROS (in order of coolness, best first): --- 1. Nextel's Direct Connect is amazingly fast and their network very clear.   --- 2. Any call, either DirectConnect or regular call can be made with the flip open or closed.  You can scroll through recent calls with the flip closed and call any of them.   --- 3. If you're concerned about radio (RF) radiation - and you should be even though nobody talks about it anymore, this phone has the extendable antenna to get the transmission point further away from you (and improves the transmission).   --- 4. The speakerphone is as loud as you need it to be, even at dinning room table with the TV on and the sound patched through the stereo system (very impressive). There is virtually no lag in the switch between listening and speaking using the speakerphone (full duplex).  You can also turn its volume down to a whisper if you want to.  --- 5. The phone is a little wider than some phones (like the V60), but is very light.  Yet the phone meets the tough Military specs. --- 6. Rubberized grips on the phone make it easy to grip and dial with one hand and phone has a comfortable feel in my medium-sized hand. Phone has slight hourglass shape (wider at the bottom) to fit nicely into the hand. --- 7. Charger charges the battery FAST...MUCH faster than my V60 ever charged. --- 8. Phone has all the standard stuff I love and couldn't live without: voice dialing, custom rings for calls from my contact list, handsfree, long recent calls list (up to 20), ability to store number to Contacts from recent calls (without having to key the number, just have to enter the name).  ---  --- CONS (in order of annoyance, worst first): --- 1. The phone is almost completely made of plastic, and I've never thought plastic was as durable as metal. While Motorola makes truly awesome phones, I worry there might be an over-reliance on plastic to protect the insides of the phone. --- 2. When the phone is in the holster, the outside display is not visible, forcing me to remove the phone from the holster to see who's calling (for those that don't have a custom ring configured) or to check the time.  Very annoying, as I'm used to using my phone as a watch. --- 3. The icons on the outside display are small and those who are overdue for a new eye prescription might have trouble seeing and interpreting the icons.  The only two parts that are clear: the battery (important) and date/time. --- 4. The flimsy port cover at bottom of the phone (where you connect the charger, etc) make me think that someday I'm going to look down there and find it missing. It's easy enough to pop off, but sometimes takes "persuading" to put back and have it cover the slot completely (because it needs to be a snug fit to meet the military spec). ---  --- OVERALL, I really like the phone and highly recommend it to all	pos
I connected all the cables as instructed, but it doesn't work, the light is not on. --- So I return it to Amazon	neg
I rented the movie and I havn't seen the first three but this one was pretty good. It wasn't the absolute best horror film but good pace of the movie, good plots and story line. I don't recommend going out and buying it  righ away cause you should rent it first and decide for yourself	pos
The Next Generation is basically a remake of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, in fact up to an hour into the film the plot is practically identical, though different characters and locations are used.  The original was a little overrated in my opinion and this "remake" is quite frankly terrible.  Bad acting with the exception of Renee Zellweger and Matthew McConaughy who do their best with a terrible script and several B movie actors.  The only major differences from the original are that Leatherface now dresses as a woman, which was fairly amusing but hardly essential, and a tacked on conspiracy theory. ---  --- The conspiracy theory of a secret society only surfaces in the last half hour and is absolutely ridiculous, I won't explain it, theres no point, watch it yourself if you want to know how stupidly the film ends.  I would sooner suggest avoiding this film completely though, even die hards admit its awful, I only gave it 2 stars because I reserve 1 star for the very worst of the worst (yes even worse than this!)	neg
Make sure you know that these will work with your camcorder before buying. Apparently, they work fine with Sony camcorders (the packet too says so) but not with Canon. Also, it's incompatible with my new Panasonic camcorder too. Interestingly, it was displayed as a combo offer when I bought my Panasonic camcorder, which is the reason why I bought it anyway, but got duped	neg
The range on this product is no where near what was advertised.  I purchased (2) units and neither will work consistently beyond 4-5 feet from mac.

I wrote this review because I felt that none of the reviews so far really got the main cause of this book. This is NOT a book about cosmology (as people would expect from Roger Penrose). In this tiny book, Penrose summarizes his idea that the mind cannot be understood by mathematical processes (something much different from the opinion of 99,99% of neurobiologists, such as Steven Pinker). This view is near to the Nobel laureate Murray Gell-Mann. The book is easy to understand and the ideas are very concise and its recommended for the ones that are interested in intelligence theories (thus, the author assumes that the reader know what a neuron is and how it works!). Some may think this is a difficult to understand book because they didn't had in mind that this book is about Penrose's point of view on intelligence. In fact, I'm not a physicist, nor a biologist, simply a high school student and I found the book very easy to understand, although I do not agree with Penrose's point of view. I think he forgot something very important. Read it and read the other point of view and you'll find what it is! :	pos
Anybody know the name of the song played at the very end of the movie, when the brother and the sister are saying goodbye to each other, when she is crying and asking him what he is going to do with his life?

I ordered the unit twice, and twice I received a Carrying Case. not the adapter.  I returned both and ordered direct from Cobra.   --- When I had called customer support for Amazon the second time, I got connected to India of course and was informed that a lot of their codes are wrong.  I guess they are trained to agree with anything the customer says.	neg
I carry a lot of tension in my neck and upper back, and as a result get a lot of headaches.  I have been using the Real-Ease for about two months, and have found it very effective at releasing the tension in my neck and upper back and alleviating my headaches.  I have not used it as a preventative - only when I already have a headache.  If something happened to the one I have, I would definitely buy another	pos
This remasted disc is nice with the bonus tracks and spiffed up sound, but the only way top hear Aoxomoxoa is to find a original W7 (Warner Brothers-Seven Arts) green label vinyl pressing. The CD features the 1971 remix (like the 1989 CD) in which 1/3 of the backing has been stripped like Constanten's prepared backrounds on "What's Become Of The Baby", the extra drums and barbershop vocal on "Doin That Rag". St Stephen lost something in the remix as well. Anthem was remixed as well in 1972 but the band was wise to issue the 1968 mix on CD. No hidden goodies on this disc, but the bonus tracks are great	pos

Nobody is safe from satire, not even Alfred Hitchcock. But Mel Brooks straddles the line between parody and affectionate homage in "High Anxiety," a hysterical psychiatric comedy that deftly references all sorts of Hitch films -- while keeping in Brooks' trademark slapstick, hilarious dialogue, and weird characters.  ---  --- Dr. Richard Thorndyke (Brooks) has just been hired as the director of Psychoneurotic Institute for the Very, VERY Nervous, after the sudden death of the previous administrator. Something odd seems to be going on -- screams are heard, a patient signals Thorndyke with a mirror, and Dr. Charles Montague (Harvey Korman) frightens a patient into fits. Then one of the doctors dies mysteriously, while trying to leave the conspiracy.  ---  --- And when Thorndyke is lecturing at a psychiatry convention, the evil Nurse Diesel (Cloris Leachman) sends a hired killer (wearing a Thorndyke mask) to frame the doctor for murder. Now Thorndyke must elude the police and the killer, clear his name with the help of a mysterious blonde heiress (Madeleine Kahn), and overcome his crippling "high anxiety."  ---  --- As a homage/spoof, this is gold. Brooks deftly weaves together elements and storylines from various Hitchock movies, including "Vertigo" and "Spellbound," with some nods to "Psycho," "North By Northwest" and "The Birds." There's dizzying looks down a wooden tower, newspaper "stabbings" in the shower, and Madeleine Kahn's strange not-so-icy blonde.  ---  --- But it's also a great movie in its own right. Rather than outright slapstick as in some of his movies, Brooks instead crafts a clever thriller framed with delicious comedy -- he even makes fun of some standard filmmaking devices. For example, Thorndyke's hotel suite is switched for a top-floor room because of a call from... "a Mr. McGuffin."  ---  --- And he fills it with hysterical comedic situations, like Victoria mistaking the sounds of a life-or-death struggle for a phone sex pervert, or Thornduke being assaulted by a crazed bellboy. And his dialogue is solidly quotable in this one ("Those who are tardy do not get fruit cup"). The highlight has to be murder-by-bad-pop song, where a man is trapped in a car with the unspeakably bad "If You Love Me Tell Me Loud Loud Loud."  ---  --- Gene Wilder wasn't available when this was made, so Brooks took the lead himself. The seriousness of the character doesn't entirely fit him, but he's a solid enough Thorndyke, especially when he has to give a G-rated speech about penis envy.  ---  --- Most of the comedy comes from an unfortunately blonde Madeleine Kahn as the chic love interest, as well as a ghoulish Leachman and S&M enthusiastic Korman ("Too much bondage, too much bondage, not enough discipline!"). And Ron Carey and Howard Morris round the cast off, as the photographically obsessed chauffeur and the stereotypical little German shrink.  ---  --- "High Anxiety" is an affectionate parody/homage to Hitchcock -- even Hitchcock was pleased by it -- but it's also a solid comedy movie. Definitely worth seeing! ---  --- (Stalking, R-Hag?	pos
I bought a set of these Uno cards for my 9-year-old grandson, a Nintendo "freak." The first night he had them he played three games with whoever was handy, and spent an hour alone arranging the cards just so. He took them to bed with him. A few days later he dashed into his other grandparent's house showing off his fancy deck of Uno cards and insisted that they play a game. He even wrote us a Thank You note telling us that the cards were the "coolest present I ever got." ---  --- The rules of the game have not changed, just the look of the cards. Nintendo characters, in all their bright colors, are the "suits." The cards are housed in a metal box, a throwback to the front half of the 20th Century. Excellent art work on the cards and on the box. ---  --- The cards and the game are appealing to all ages. I enjoyed playing and getting acquainted with the Nintendo characters (my grandson explained them all to me). This is a great family game and this Nintendo set is a great gift. It helps close the "generation gap." I highly recommend this item. Enjoy. ---  --- One last thing: I bought a second deck for another grandson and his response was pretty much the same.	pos
I tried this swing then this Fisher-Price's Open Travel Swing. In both swings my baby would lean forward and fold himself in half in the seat. The Jungle swing was difficult to haul around since it didn't stay closed well and the "palm tree" was always in the way. Finally I bought the Fisher-Price Aquarium Swing. I found the seat of the Aquarium swing to be deeper and it clicks in place (so it won't fold over on baby) and it is easier to assemble and haul around	neg
We bought this game knowing Shrek movies are a bit raunchy, but thinking the game would be ok for a 6 year old to play.After watching my son play this game for a few minutes... I saw that he had to stun chickens and put them in a pot of boiling water while they were still alive. Then after that, he punched large turtles and threw them on tables where there backs were cracked open and died.  I can't believe a game that is rated E for Everyone would have little kids (or whoever played it) have to be so mean to animals.  What's next, ripping the head off a rabbit? I consider myself one of the coolest moms around, but this totally crossed the line	neg
     this stroller is the BEST 250.00 that i have spent in a long time!!  we live in texas and were using a regular double stroller to walk the dog with our 2 daughters (aged 16 mo's and 3) around a one mile loop in our neighborhood.  depending on weather and moods sometimes we'd do 3 laps.  it was such a CHORE pushing that old stroller up and down our neighborhood hills.  plus, i can actually JOG or even RUN!!!  i can't tell who loves it more, me, the dog, or my girls.  it's light, easy to steer, worth EVERY penny.  plus, i love the fold out visors for shade for the girls.  oh, and it was incredibly easy to put together	pos

It was pretty damn funny! ---  --- This movie was recommended by my good friend, Bobby Asslong.  In most cases his recommendations are a bunch of [...], but he hit it right on, with this one!  I detest Tom Green.  He is one of those guys, who that when he fails at something (Talk Show, most of his movies, life) I actually feel happy.  And this is actually contrary to my normal personality.  I normally automatically love all Canadians.  Just kidding. I normally want people to succeed, and feel bad when they fail.   ---  --- But Tom Green is so annoying. ---  --- Great news!  He is in only about 4 or 5 scenes in this whole movie, so you should be able to get through this movie, with little to none hatred for Mr. Green. ---  --- I love all the characters in this movie, especially the main protagonist, who accidentally sends the videotape to his girlfriend at a far away college.  He is very likeable, and you're pulling for him the whole time.  Another thing I like this movie, is that it pulls a lot from other "gross out" teen and college flicks, but it doesn't go overboard in the gross out department. ---  --- Tom Green plays the Voice Over explainer in the movie, and he actually does a pretty good job, without appearing stupid.   ---  --- I give this high reviews! ---  --- MC White said:  Check it out!!	pos

I'm taking it back to the store ASAP!!  According to the programs, I have a full signal on both the keyboard and the mouse while typing, but you see what comes out!  Not once have I had a low signal warning or anything.  I just get random intermittent letters to appear.  Now, perhaps it's because the receiver is back by my monitor and the keyboard is on the keyboard tray, but my goodness!  This thing is supposed to have a range of 6 feet.  I measured and they're about a foot and a half apart!! ---  --- I type for hours on end per day and have been typing "properly" for about 16 years.  I type much too fast and much too frequently to be able to deal with such random signals!!  Another thing I noticed about the 6000 (and actually was concerned with it while I was trying it out in the store) is that it makes my fingers feel cramped.  Perhaps it's due to the curve of the keyboard and I'm just not used to it yet (although I have used split key ergonomic keyboards and never had a probelm with them.  The 4000 felt fine (even though it has a somewhat awkward layout!!) ---  --- No matter what, that thing is going back!  I'm far too agitated to keep it! ---  --- Oh, there are some neato plusses!  I love the shortcut keys.  It's nice to be able to just hit one key and get my e-mail, my music, my pictures, or whatever else I assign the keys to.  I had gotten excited about that feature, and will be sad to lose it (even though I only had it for about an hour.) ---  --- Better luck to the rest of you	neg

CONS --- *WON'T STAY IN PLACE --- I've tried several times to position this correctly and it always slips out of place (and baby is out of view) I even sent away for the extra tether thinking that was the problem but no luck. --- *WHY A REMOTE? --- Tell me what use the remote is when you have to press the on button which is located ON the mirror and then if you don't use the remote within five minutes to turn it on it automatically shuts off rendering the remote useless for the remainder of your car ride?  --- *THE IRRITATING SONG  --- too short and plays over and over and over (teeth gritting) --- *LEARN WHAT? --- I've also noticed in the teaching mode it doesn't light up the right item with what the voice is saying. My poor confused baby will now think a blue car is a boat and a yellow house is a car... ---  --- PROS --- *Now I have $39.99 less to spend on snacks that will hinder me from losing those pregnancy pounds I gained..	neg
I bought this almost exactly 2 years ago, and I turned it on the other day and went to take a picture indoors that required a flash, and the flash would not work. It was set to automatic flash.  Using the auto setting, I thought there used to be 3 flash settings (auto, forced flash and no flash), but now there were only 2.  I took it outside on a sunny day and used the auto flash, and the flash went off outside!  Something is messed up and it has the light and dark confused.  ---  --- Thinking I hit something and changed a setting, I reset it to the factory defaults and it still doesn't work.  It will probably be too expensive to get it fixed, and it's weird but I just upgraded to a Nikon D50.  I must have known this camera was about to die. ---  --- Even when it worked, half the time pictures came out blurry. I either got fantastic crystal clear shots or blurry ones as if the auto focus missed.  Maybe the camera was defective the entire time I had it. No more Canons for me	neg
This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film. ---  --- Sweetie, written and directed by award winning filmmaker, Jane Campion best known for the film "The Piano" is the story about a young couple in a distant relationship. One day the womans mentally ill sister Dawn "Sweetie" breaks into their house and lives with them. She is not on her medication and creates havoc. When her father visits after his wife leaves him, he tries to calm her but is unsuccessful.  ---  --- It is never mentioned what kind of illness Dawn has. I thought the film was too graphic and recommend eaisliy offended people not watch it. ---  --- The DVD has some great special features. There is a theatrical trailer, behind the scenes photos, audio commentary by director Jane Campion and director of photography, Sally Bongers and screenwriter Gerard Lee. There are interviews with lead actresses, Genevieve Lemon and Karen Colston. There is a 1989 conversation between Campion and film critic Peter Thompson made after the success of her short films. ---  ---  Finally, there are 3 of her short films made as a student. The first film, An Exercise in Discipline: Peel, is about a man and his son and sister out for a drive. The son has trown orange peels out the window and his father stops the car and demands he pick them up. The second film, Passionless Moments; is a series of short scenes about various situations. The third film, A Girl's Own Story, is about schoolgirls who do various activities. ---  --- This film is ok but is not appropriate for children	neg

McMurry's text is a very friendly, gentle intro to  organic. It's a thoroughly enjoyable read, but it doesn't teach you what you need to  know.  Explanations for important mechanisms are usually very brief, and the  problems included are usually very basic and general (the spectroscopy and  synthesis problems, in particular).  If you're looking to become a chemist,  this is not the book to learn from. I'd recommend  Vollhardt and Schore's  textbook, or any number of sophomore-level texts that will give you the  skills you need to approach complicated problems more successfully (i.e.,  on exams or out in the industry)	neg
This isn't a review of this product, so much as it's a review of the impression it makes.  Anyone who was in Paris around the turn of the century will remember Aubade's "Lecons de Seduction" advertising campaign, of which the image shown here for this "tanga" was a part.  Each item of lingerie featured in the ads featured a little piece of advice to the wearer as to how she could use this item to make the right sort of  impression ... and isn't that just what frilly little underthings like this are for?  Nothing has made a stronger impression on us	pos
I bought this toy for my 4 year old grandaugher.  Since Barbie rides this horse of course a little girl will want her doll to ride the horse.  The wings fall off.  We must put the wings back on at least a dozen time a day	neg
I've had several trimmers over the years and this one is by far the best.  Strong motor, easy adjust, strong vacuum.  Other reviewers commenting on the flimsy guard is kinda suprising to me.  One wouldn't want to push down hard against the face when trimming a beard.... the idea is to glide the unit over your beard... you're not raking, you're trimming! --- Also the unit is easy to clean out after use.  The waste receptacle snaps out easily, as does the cutter head in order to shake out or brush out debris	pos
In considering that I purchased this item for my bedroom, I would have to say that it is perfect.  For aesthetic reasons I preferred an analog wall clock, but the thought of hearing the second hand tick all night was not an option until I found this item by LaCrosse.  It could not be anymore perfect, as its looks, PRICE, and self (time) adjusting qualities has made this an. "M.F." (Major Find).  Now I can sleep through the Daylight Savings time adjustments not having to worry about the actual adjustment of my clock, but whether or not I will be an hour early, or late to work	pos

This shoe is very comfortable, unfortunately I had to send it back to the manufacturer twice, the second time choosing a different style shoe because the net material comes loose from the seems where the laces are. I am very dissapointed as I have come to expect quality from Merrell and these shoes fall apart in a few weeks.  I would recommend a different shoe as this one will last you between 1 and 3 weeks before ripping	neg

The Pros are this product has alot of functionality for the price. The odometer and heart rate functions were very accurate. The set-up and operations get easier with use (first few times you will need to refer to the manual). The manual is well written and thorough.

I am realtively new to country music. I purchased this because I had the pleasure of hearing Willie sing "You Don't Know Me" on CMT one afternoon. I was quite taken with his rendition and recalled hearing this song growing up. From this one time "soft rocker" I couldn't be happier. Go Willie	pos
I just purchased this item -  now I'm planning to return it tomorrow.  One of the advertised features, the ability to store liner notes just doesn't work properly.  They just don't into the pocket without bending and/or forcing them in.  To me, the liner notes have value and I'm not willing to fold, spindle, or otherwise mutilate them to fit them into the wallet	neg
In theory an excellent product -- room for lots of disks, relatively compact and attractive HOWEVER I purchased three of these (2 for me 1 for a friend) I can't say how his is doing but both of mine have faulty zippers, making  it impossible to close the binders and therefore losing much of their attractiveness and compactness. (...). All in all, a disappointment	neg

Not to impressed with this company. 3rd item I have bought and the table top had to be reglued and screwed. Also the table top had major horizontal cracks. I don't believe they check their quality of their products	neg
I never wear this top after having purchased it.  The stripes have awkward stitches that irritate the skin touching them.  The shirt itself hangs very awkwardly.  I prefer fitted shirts for working out and this one kind of flares out at the waist on me and, therefore, isn't very flattering.  I think I've worn it once and will probably donate it soon.  Generally, I have been pleased with Adidas products, but this shirt did not work for me personally. 	neg
We loved this toy when my daughter received it for Christmas.  She loved to lay in her crib and look at it and recently even learned to turn it on by herself!  This morning I looked at the toy and noticed that the water compartment was almost empty!  The water drained out of the compartment it belongs in and back in to the part which contains the musical mechanisms and the battery connections!  It's not exactly fixable, so we will move on to another crib toy	neg
This is the absolute cutest general neutral baby bedding set out there.  The colors are fabulous, the material is soft and nice, and I was SO pleased by its overall quality.  We also purchased some of the extras, (the lamp, pillow, and wall hangings) and were just as pleased.  I would reccommend this bedding to any person expecting a child that doesn't wish to know the gender before it's born, but also any parent that does know, be assured, it is great for a girl or boy, especially if you like animals!! 	pos
     This pack is really Bad! I LOVE attacktix, but this pack is terible! The only good figues are Luke Skywalker, and Megatron. Darth Vader's arm broke, Super Optimus Prime's blast shoots before you press the button, and the battle masters are Pathetic. The Battle Master's point value is 70 each, but they are very easy to kill, and their blasts are very bad. ---     Do yourself a faver, skip this and buy the Star Wars attacktix series 4 starter set	neg

This version "Wind and Cloud - The Storm Riders" made in 2004 is not the same as "The Storm Riders" made in 1998. ---  --- This dvd is a condensed version of a TV series packaged by Tai Seng. It is full-screen and was made for TV. It is pretty disjointed as it was condensed into 2 hours from 30 hours. ---  --- Most people doing the reviews for this DVD is confusing everyone writing positive reviews for the 1998 film staring Aaron Kwok and Ekin Chen	neg

this pair of pistols is quite entertaining. i have purchased quite a few airsoft guns in the last 6 months, and these are surprisingly the more powerful of what ive purchased. dualing spring pistols is a challenge, but there are ways to work the slide with 1 hand. they're flimsy, but with enough care and responsibility theyll last a while. definitely worth 16 buck	pos
This movie was cheeseball beginning to end...I thought the concept was corny even before I watched it but decided to give it a try anyway. Big mistake. A robot who can love? Lame! And with all this high tech stuff the docs can't bring the couple's real son out of a coma (or whatever was wrong with him) so the parents forget all about him and get some robot kid who can 'love' but lacks the common sense of a human making him a danger to himself and everyone..Brialliant plan (especially considering the amount of orphan human kids there must be in this messed up futuristic world)..Then the real son wakes up and comes home and thats when the problems with the robot kid begin. The family decides they don't want the robot and the mom 'loves' him so much she dumps him somewhere instead of sending him back to the lab to be humanely disposed of...It was then I knew I was smelling a stinker but NOOOOO someone else wanted to watch it till the end until he soon found out the horrible truth...I have since nicknamed it Artificial Idiocy...The worst part was the end, Ugh, I don't even want to get into it but those of you who see the title of my review above and have seen the movie know what I mean. The whole plot was muddled and full of holes with no sense of realism. For those of you who have not seen it, I suggest renting it before you buy it. Maybe this movie is great for some people, it just wasn't my thing. 	neg

I purchased this movie for my 7 year old twin boys birthday thinking that because it said the rating was PG that it would be fine.  Also, the market for Transformers is huge with boys their age and the toys being sold everywhere.  Wow, were we hugely surprised to hear curse words on this cartoon movie.  These were not just words like shoot or dang, but the real deal.  I remember Transformers when I was growing up and I certainly do not remember their being foul language in the cartoons.  I am going to take this matter up with higher management and at least get my money back and try find out what they were thinking.  Who knows what the rating will end up being for the upcoming movie at the box office.   --- Concerned in Alabam	neg
Nothing but problems with unit since I received it.  Either it did not work when I went to use it or it had lost its memory and had to be recalibrated all over again.  Never had the same weight reading twice! The only reason I rated it with 1 star is because it would not let me enter anything less	neg
I read the review Marci Carl about the Jennifer Chiaverini books The Quilter'ed Apprentice.  I am as totally hooked on these books and have them all now as I am your magazine.

I have two double strollers, 1 front and back Graco and this side by side Aria.  I don't use the front/back Graco much do to not being able to have both children sleeping at the same time (2 1/2 year and 1 year.  I had the Peg MT single first and loved it.  So thought the product quality would be the same.  Used it for 2 years with no problems.  But have to say stay clear of the aria design.  Our side by side had numerous pieces fall off, cup holder, seat clip, logo tag, clip to hold trays in place, etc.  Its not durable at all!  We even have to close it using a pen on one side due to the clip you lift on the left side falling off too!  We took it on a plane trip last week and have sworn the whole stroller off.   My sister in law had the single and was having the same problems with the product.  She has since bought the Maclaren single and I am in the process of purchasing the Maclaren Twin Techno.  It may cost more but it would have been alot cheeper buying it first than second	neg
It takes an HBCU graduate to write about the HBCU experience, period. Just look at "A Different World" and how bad the first season was. Debbie Allen (a Howard grad, I believe) stepped in and gave the show the authenticity it sorely needed. So it's no surprise that Spike Lee, the Morehouse man, would make a movie that sparked so much emotion on both sides of the coin. I'm not saying that you had to attend an HBCU to UNDERSTAND "School Daze", but you had to have attended one to get the real "flavor" of what it was like. And you have to have an open mind. ---  --- Any HBCU alum saying that this film wasn't realistic is flat-out lying. Yes, it hit on some things that the old folks call "dirty laundry" (such as hazing, color issues, those who think that getting an education makes you "white", and so on), but those things are real at HBCUs - yes, even today. (Major props to Spike for having that ONE dark-skinned sista in the Gamma Rays. Isn't that ALWAYS the way?) And there are no "good" people or bad people; Spike leaves that decision up to you. Julian had his good points (his intelligence, leadership and pride in his town, school, etc) and Dap had his bad points (his blatant bigotry and bullying), and both of them had legitimate points.  ---  --- One thing Spike nailed right on was the confrontations that the students tended to have on a regular basis. No offense to whites or anyone who graduated from a PWC, but in my experience at a predominately white high school, I noticed that students there were a lot more subtle with their dislike; they particpated in a more "destroying from within" kind of system, and grew wide-eyed and offended when confronted, even with solid proof. ("I would NEVER spread rumors about you/sleep with your boyfriend/steal your term paper!") Black students, on the other hand, will take ANYONE head-on, whether that person is the school president, captain of the football team, the richest kid on campus, crippled...doesn't matter. Your "status" doesn't count if you go to an HBCU. I had a friend who saw SD and said "That is SO unrealistic! Since when do college kids go fighting with each other all the time?" She graduated from the University of Texas. Enough said. ---  --- I'm so grateful for this film, and its realistic portrayal of black HBCU students for those who think that all young black people do is have babies and suck up welfare, and that people only go to HBCUs because they can't get into a "real" college. I wouldn't trade my experience at Florida A&M University for a degree at any PWC. RATTLERS	pos
For all of you looking for that favorite book "The Silly Book", join my club (not literally).  The book that has the ode to Boodleheimer was written by Stoo Hample not Babette Cole.

I used Version 8 and 9 and NEVER experienced a problem.  Version 10.latest version is terrible.  Crash and burn.  Don't take their advice and re-install your operating system.  Its THEIR software and not the OS.  Amazon and Pinnacle (Avid) continue to sell this product even though its terrible.  I read it was re-written for version 10 and they CAN'T get it right.  Nonetheless, they still charge full price and for support calls. The upgrade should have been free. ---  --- There are several good products now so Pinnacle isn't your only choice.  I changed to Sony Vegas and am very happy but it does a have a learning curve.  For super simple try Ulead or one of the others.	neg
Perfect, exactly what I expected and wanted. I ride to work in rain or shine or storm and was sick of the water shooting up, had it on in less then 5 min. My bike is full suspension, 26 inch wheels with that horse shoe (U) bar on the lower legs of the front fork and it still fit with no problem. Don't know how it would handle a crash in trees though, sits high like a dirt bike look. People ask where I got it	pos

I am a new harmonica player trying to substitute shopping and technical research for practice and talent.  I went out and bought nearly every diatonic harmonica under 40 bucks.  Most fell by the wayside.  I still use the Special 20 every day for a couple of reasons. The one I have is easy to play.  And only the plastic cone touches your lips, not the brass plate that sticks out on lots of Hohners.  (That's the only reason the Golden Melody comes in second for me.)  Overall, it just feels really nice in your hand, smoother even than the non-stick Pro models.   ---  --- Unless you are shopping addicted, as I am, this is the only harmonica you are going to need for a long time	pos
I really like Bruce Campbell and his movies like Army of Darkness. But this movie is not in the same league. First of all the plot is slow and boring. Bruce does not have the same rouge character that he is so good at. Instead the movie is filled with frankly depressing scenes of him in bed or limping around barely able to move. This really hampers the action aspects of the movie. The dialogue aspect is not much better.  ---  --- If you like Bruce, my advise is to get his other movies or try to get a hold of the TV episodes of  "Jack of all trades" episodes. It is a lot more fun and has the "real" Bruce	neg
This product is a great evening tea to help you relax and gently eases you too sleep.

Quick reader, poor design. It does a great job copying images to my Mac, but the flimsy lid is a piece of poo-poo. It stays on tight, which is good, until you try to open it. The force required to open it pulls the lid completely off making the ball-groove hinges useless. It's only a matter of time until the weak arms containing the hinges snap off, leaving the reader exposed to the elements	pos
I've bought two of these atomic clocks. The first, a 12" wood framed model, soon stopped keeping accurate time and started acting unpredictably.

I'll be brief: ---  --- First of all: out of the 81 reviews of this product currently on Amazon, 31 are 1-star.  That should tell you something. ---  --- Pros: --- When it actually works, it /does/ cool down your 360. ---  --- Cons: --- 1) Crashing --- Caused more crashes than it prevented.  Running without the Nyko instantly reduced the number of crashes and freezing problems I had. ---  --- 2) Loud as hell --- Turn on your 360.  Put a hairdryer next to it, and turn it on, on low.  Step back and sit where you normally play.  That is how loud this product will make your 360. ---  --- 3) Hard to set up, frequently stops working. --- It took a lot of playing around just to get it to work the first time.  It snap fits well to the back of the 360, but despite that, there's some impossible magic to the angles and tightness of the power connector... we're talking millimeter tolerances here.  If you're off by just a tiny bit, it won't work at all, and the XBox won't even power on.  This wouldn't be too bad if you only had to go through this headache once, but no: it's loose enough that you risk disconnecting it (and setting it up all over again) every time you touch the power cord or move the 360. ---  --- 4) Many people have reported this unit causing actual damage to their 360s.  You better have a replacement plan for your 360 handy, and never mention the Nyko when you try to RMA your box.  If you let it slip, you probably won't be covered. ---  --- That's it for the Nyko.  I returned mine within 2 weeks. ---  --- I've been searching for a good cooler for the 360 since I got one.  Unfortunately, it is my opinion that there are NO GOOD COOLERS FOR THE 360 ON THE MARKET.  The fan-stands (yes, I've bought and returned them) are decent coolers, but require you to run your 360 vertically, which is a big no-no.  A number of websites have shown that the 360 DVD-rom drive will EAT your DVDs and games when it's vertical.  I had hoped this was overexaggerated, but then the problems started happening to me... I'ver personally seen what appears to be damage on my /mint/ condition games when running the 360 vertically.  I also experienced frequent game-loading problems (including hideous slowdowns) in games like Halo 2 (where you can actually see a progress bar) when played on a vertical 360 (it worked just fine with it horizontally).  So, horizontal is the way to go. ---  --- In the end, I ended up building my own cooler out of some old (still loud, but MUCH QUIETER) computer fans and a 12 volt adapter, and slapped it on the side.  Works well, probably cools as well as the Nyko, but without the noise or the crashing!  Your best bet, if you can't do something like that, is to just buy a little clip fan (with its own power adapter) and have it blow into the right side/bottom (the vents away from the DVD drive) of your 360	neg
This is a nice case, however, i needed something more sleek and small to fit into my purse when i go out with my friends. This case is bulky and my Panasonic FXO1 would fit into something much smaller.

This is a GREAT magazine! I love the beautiful pictures . . . even if I'm not looking for a project - this is enjoyable just to look through.

I have used Medela's Pump In Style Advance for 4 months now after having my first baby.  This pump is the best in its class and it is the best thing I bought in 2006. ---  --- Why I gave this item 5-star ratings:- ---  --- 1) It helped me to establish a steady milkflow from the 2nd week of breastfeeding.  I am a working mom and had only 8 weeks off from delivery till I have to get back to work again.  So it was important for me to rely on a good breast-pump to keep the supply going.   ---  --- 2) This pump is comfortable to use and I can regulate the speed which is suitable for me.  The Medela parts are easy to set up for usage and also easy to wash & sterilise. ---  --- 3) It never breakdown ever!  For 4 months now, and I'm pumping 4 - 5 times a day.  I bring this unit to the office and also whenever I am travelling.  It is very mobile, although a little heavy to carry. ---  --- 4) It has a battery pack which is handy whenever I am in a place without power-supply. ---  --- 5) I bought this online in Amazon for USD$ 319.  But in Malaysia, this unit would have cost MYR1800 (USD$ 500).   ---  --- Just a note for non-US users (like myself), you need to get an adapter which is compatible with this pump.  This can be easily obtained from any electrical shops. ---  --- This is a good buy, if you're looking for a pump, then you have found it! ---  ---  --- 	pos

This live album/in-studio acoustic EP is hard to figure. Most of the live stuff is selected from BLS's "Stronger Than Death" album, which wasn't all that great to begin with. The only good thing being; that album was so poorly mixed that live versions of "All For You" and "13 Years Of Grief" sound much better and immediate than their studio counterparts. A new heavier version of "No More Tears" tries to please, but fails by showing Zakk Wylde's gruff vocals don't always work. Unexpectedly, the bonus acoustic EP is the far better attraction. "Like A Bird" is the best song Neil Young never wrote and "Blood In The Well" shows Zakk's soloing chops in full form. BLS needed some better songs before doing a live record. End of story	neg
I got this puzzle for my three children (age 5, 4, and 2) and within a day my 2 year old had chewed off enough of the little black rubber pieces that the toy no longer worked.

I was aniticpatng a riveting documentary... After reading some books on Tibet, I thought this documentary would be especially enlightening. I found it to be slow paced, repetitive and thin on factual information (factual history and an intelligent logical supportable case for the Tibetan side of the Chinese invasion/occupation) and heavy on "experiences and testimonials" of certain Tibetans. The bit about "the American's abandoned us" was un-necessary and somewhat of a turn off. Not that this man felt abandoned (I have the utmost compassion for his experiences), but rather that the editors of this piece opted to include his comments along side the "evil communist Chinese" bits. Overall, this documentary of the Tibetan experience is too heavy on the emotionally charged (I did cry at one point), too repetitive (frankly, it gets boring), and too thin on (non emotionally charged) information.	neg

Oh Fusion Razor, Fusion Razor, --- Gleaming long and bright. --- Bring to the growth upon my face --- Your buzzing, five-blade might! ---  --- Your contours sleek and overformed, --- Your gripping action steady. --- Your shaving power manifold, --- T'would make a weak mind heady. ---  --- What thoughtfulness lies 'neath your shine? --- You gleam like spaceship rubble! --- And with your "Future Now" design, --- You lay waste to my stubble! ---  --- Too bad you lay waste also to --- The skin beneath the hair. --- Now I bemoan the scabby strokes --- That mar my visage fair. ---  --- Purring like a happy tiger --- That stalks its helpless prey, --- With your five and shining claws, --- My face you swiftly flay. ---  --- Our first few dates were sweet as silk, --- Your touch was oh-so-gentle. --- But by date three you bit and chewed, --- You've proven tempermental. ---  --- Oh, Fusion Razor, Fusion Razor, --- Why have you done me wrong? --- Although you're mighty, it's too bad --- My skin is not as strong. ---  --- Why do I keep on giving you --- A chance to find redemption? --- What razor god hath granted thee --- Such epiderm exemption? ---  --- Oh, no more, no, my razor friend, --- Your doom is clearly written --- By tributaries crimson red --- That on my cheeks you've smitten. ---  --- I wondered when I purchased you, --- Just what the "fusion" meant. --- Now I think it marks the meld --- 'Twixt shaves and punishment. ---  --- "The leading edge of science!" --- "The future is today!" --- "The greatest shave technology!" --- Your advertisements say. ---  --- Technology's not always good. --- Although it's what life's built on, --- It also causes wars and monsters --- (much like Paris Hilton). ---  --- I need no buzzing, layered mesh --- Of steel that swiftly flails. --- I think I'd rather shave myself --- With dull Lee Press-on-Nails. ---  --- So, adieu, my Fusion Razor, --- Don't leave in dour depression. --- Take comfort in that tho' your banned, --- You still left an impression	neg
This is a great exercise ball.  It is great in helping your body tone up by balancing yourself using the ball with various floor routines.  Let me tell you!!!  It is very hard to balance yourself on this ball and I can really feel my muscles working out .  It helps strengthen your muscles and gives you better balance and flexibility.  this is a great  product!!!!!!!!	pos
I worked hard on a VCD project for work using Photo Explosion. I didn't think it was that easy to use, but it was okay until I got ready to burn.  Got a little error message that said something along the lines of "You don't have Nero burners!" No kidding, but there are four other burn programs on my computer. Nothing but Nero would do.  NOWHERE on the box are you informed of this.  It says, and I quote, "Burn CD slideshows you can watch on tv!" Needing more software is never mentioned. As far as I'm concerned, this product makes fraudulent claims.  I will never buy another one of their products	neg

I have now seen about twenty Asian horror films, and this series definitely ranks among the best.  I have written more extensive reviews under the individual titles, but suffice it to say that these movies make Audition look like a Disney romance.  Bleak, bizarre, and ultra violent, yet surprisingly stylish and intelligent.  This film maker has something to say, and will beat you senseless to make his point.   ---  --- In short, if you want to see Ringu #25, stay away from this one.  If you feel a bit more adventurous, I highly recommend this series	pos
Since we bought this to work with our Mac, we have had nothing but problems.  If asked to print one page of a document only, it freaks out, all the lights flash and has to be turned off an on again to reset it and calm it down!  Have had long sessions with HP customer service on the phone and they haven't a clue.  If we could have been bothered, we would have taken it back, but just live with the fact that we have to print excess pages (at least we do recycle).  There are various other things that also cause it to freak and flash, can never work out specifically what, we just sigh and reset it.   Will be looking for something else to upgrade to soon	neg
This pirate chest is a total rip off.  The chest is cheaply made and the contents inside are minimal.  When I ordered it as a gift for someone, they sent me someone else's order....then refused to let me return my item for a refund when I finally received it.  The company was very rude and not helpful in the mix up at all. 	neg

I purchased this baby carrier for my 1-month-old son.  When I put him in it, he looked so uncomfortable.  I tried putting a blanket in there underneath him to prop him up a bit, but it still covered his face.  So, I decided to shell out the $[...] for the infant support pillow, expecting that to make a difference.  It didn't.  He still looked uncomfortable and squished, only now I wasted MORE money. My son is 21 1/2 inces and 11 lbs 4 oz.  I can't imagine how a bigger baby could fit in this at all.  A big disappointment.  If you're looking for a carrier, try the Bjorn.  A million times better than this	neg
This stuff smells just like philosophy's handmade hand cream but not as strong, that's why I took one point off. It has a light, sweet lemon scent with a vanilla background.

Better just to throw it away rather than saddle someone with a mistake I made.

The fabric is a little stiff at first, bust softens to a acceptable level after a few washes. The elastic band around the waist of these boxers contracts to the point where it wrinkles up the fabric. After a few hours of wear you have the indents of the crinkled up band on your skin and it feels quite uncomfortable. While cheap and nicely packaged, these things suck. Spend some money on decent underwear	neg
Proving that there's life in the old dog yet, Bushnell have come up with this, the successor to the out-dated, poor-performing Trophy Splashproof Spotting Scope, and I have to say, it's a fantastic improvement. As soon as I took it out of the box I was impressed with its styling, shape, colour, and of course, waterproofness. I set it up in my front room and spent a happy couple of hours watching my neighbours coming and going, and they were oblivious to my surveillance. It's not the most subtle 'scope out there but stick a blanket over your head and you're laughing. Any one who has been caught out in the rain will appreciate this little beauties moulded plastic housing, as water really does roll off it like, erm, water off a duck's back. Stunning	pos
That's all I could think of when my family and I sat down to watch this movie together.  We had told the story to our children about the miraculous staircase built without nails in a small chapel in Santa Fe.  The story itself is so powerful and moving. Built in the 1870s, the chapel was nearly complete when it became apparent the choir loft stairs would not fit. The sisters' prayed a novena to St. Joseph and on the ninth day their prayers were answered when a mysterious carpenter arrived, built the "miraculous" staircase, and then disappeared without being paid. The staircase is a double helix with no visible support. It's 23 feet tall and makes two 360 degree spirals, and the wood used is not a known wood in any area near Santa Fee! ---  --- This movie however is about a mother superior who has faith but harbors real resentment towards Indians and also likes to curse (how this has anything to do with the actual story I still have no idea!).  At one point when a nun is "shocked" to hear mother curse mother surperior responds "Oh Margret get off the cross and get down here with the rest of us".  When the mysterious carpenter shows up and starts to build the staircase, the architect and the contractor decide that this is a bad thing and threaten to kill the carpenter.  Meanwhile this carpenter who is sent by "God" builds the staircase with wood that doesn't work, is arrested after being falsly accused of attempted murder, and leaves everyone to believe vandalls destroyed the staircase when in fact he originally destroyed it before rebuilding it better.  In the end the staircase is built and this mother superior (who is on death's door) is so moved that she literally crawls up the staircase in a very "weird"/"uncomfortable" scene until she reaches the choir loft and dies.  Wow, inspiring. --- The best thing I could think of is this director and writer took a wonderful and moving story and turned it into a Hollywood flop. This was obviously written, directed, and produced by people who have no idea how the staircase was built but are pretty darn sure it wasn't a miracle because hey, miracles just don't happen. The acting was pretty good but the story was junk.  Unfortunately I bought this movie.   ---  --- If you are looking for a true inspirational movie that you can watch with your family, rent or buy Mother Theresa with Olivia Hussey.  Hands down the best Saints movie every filmed.  Half way through the movie my 5 year old says out loud "Wow, she REALLY cares about everybody!"  Inspirational movie, compared to this disappointment	neg
I guess I must have had the same mindset as Adam in the previous review.  I too set up the main unit and the remote side by side to see if the readings from both units would agree, along with another very accurate digital thermometer.  After six hours, the temperature readings from all of the units were within one degree, but the humidity readings from the remote unit were lower by 4 to 8 percent as compared the humidity reading from the main unit... which is 3 to 7 percent too much IMO since they were side by side.  What good is having a relative humidity function if you cannot trust the readings?  I will return the unit. ---  --- Also, on my unit, the front wood bezel apparently had a small defect and it was repaired (from the factory) with a wood filler type material... but the defect was still obvious	neg
We live in a city and we got a minor ding on the side of the car. We bought this kit a few years ago somewhere other than Amazon (think a auto store). Anyway we did what it said and did it several times. It did take some of the ding out but not all of it. We barely got the glue off from it. A few years later we got hit by a suv when we were getting the car fixed we had the guy remove the ding and now it looks perfect. Sadly this thing was not worth the money or effort we put into it. I also watched Fox 5 and they tested the item it didn't work for them either. I know it will cost more but take it to a auto shop and get the ding removed there. Don't buy this product it is worthless.	neg
I had the good fortune to tour the Richeson Easel Factory. I was truly impressed! Incredible craftsmanship, attention to detail, and as I came to find out, service oriented. I would never buy a different brand after seeing what went into it. Extra note: They use Lyptus wood. As hard as oak, but a renewable resource. When you buy one, it tells you all about it. Really fine easels	pos

I was hoping that they were a little larger in size and not as thick. However, I think it's a decent buy for only $30.00 I bought this as a stocking stuffer for my girlfriend. It comes packaged in a beautiful velvet blue box thats almost big enough to fit a watch. Very clean presentation when you open it up. The white gold really shines. The free shipping was FAST...and I do mean quick. I ordered this late at night and it arived the very next day. I've never had a quicker shipment for free before. If your looking for a great deal on white gold earings, I think you've found it	pos
Maybe I'm bias because I really like Yamaha, maybe, because I have kinda' good ears or, it's the fat check sitting on my table  from Yamaha; but what ever it is I realllllllly like this sub-woofer. ---  ---  I looked around a long time for the right sub, and, I like to think I got a good one here. ---  You want power? Ok, it's only 250 watts -not 1,000 watts like Velodyne, but in my room (30 by 18ish with a 25 foot ceiling) it ROCKS. ---   --- I love music, all kinds; loud or quiet no matter I like both, but I do like depth more than volume. However, I believe if you are going to listen to something real loud, being able to feel the music is as important as being able to here it. --- And let me say you can FEEL music if you want to. ---  one of the things I love most about this sub is it's range; it can (maybe) reach 20 hertz. 20 hertz! that is astounding. --- 20Hz is the lowest frequency the human ear can hear, in fact it's starting into the range of sounds that are felt more than heard. ---  --- Maybe I have good ears and maybe I don't, but to hear rich airy low-end, and, bass notes. yes! bass NOTES! bass is not one big boomy lump of noise, it's huge, open, grazing pasture of distinct sounds! ---  --- In short, music sounds great, even hip-hop (which I don't like) sounds, well, better. --- Also, their is no need to turn the volume way up to hear a improvement; at very quiet levels too, you can hear good clean bass notes. But, if you do a lot of quite listening, we're talking back ground music levels: disable the auto-on feature and manually turn it on and off, because if you happen to be listening to something quiet, even if you still can here low notes from this, it does not seem to be enough signal to keep the auto-on, well... on. ---   --- It improves movies as well, take something  with a lot of dynamics like, "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" or, "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" there are a lot of sudden loud, and very low sounds in those movie's and the Yamaha handles it all with aplomb. ---   --- With most of the controls are on the front set-up is and tweaking is made easy, and if you are wondering about the "BASS" button: if the button is in the "music" position you will have to turn the volume to a higher level to shake the termites out of the walls than if its set to the "movie" position (I think "music" is a flatter frequency response). ---  As this review seems to be getting a bit long I'll some it up: --- yes, there are far better subwoofers out there (like from B&W), but I don't have the money for those, and if someone gave me a 1,000 watt Velodyne I would take it in a heartbeat- but, I wouldn't want to give this one up too. --- It's a absolute pleasure to listen to. ---  ---  --- Update: I have run some test tones on this subwoofer, and well, it can not reach 20Hz. 38Hz seems to be the limit for usable bass, although it is still audible to around 32Hz, 20Hz is a stretch. --- If 38Hz sounds to high: their are not many movie's or CD's that have any sounds below 35Hz. And very, very few have sound below 25Hz. --- Although it does not go as low as I would have hoped, it is still a good sub for the money, and still worth a five star review	pos
I love this grill just last night i made pizza on it for the first time it's got a awesome amount of cooking space for such a portable grill. it's great we use it on our patio all the time. --- the build quality is great and it's very easy to clean --- i think they even added some vents into the design so the airflow is awesome... --- and with amazons free shipping you cant find a better deal anywhere	pos
I use Adobe Acrobat Professional extensively both as an attorney and as a researcher/author.  Because of the new features advertised which would enhance Acrobat storage of PowerPoint presentations, I bought it off the shelves at a local Staples office supply dealer.  I am proficient at my own installations and expected no trouble on this.  It acted like a virus.  The program did not finish installing.  Worse yet, it corrupted the underlying 7.0 installation and fixed that so the Windows Controller program could not install it. I had to hack through the registry to remove traces of it.  Finally I got to a stage where it appeared to be going through the registry process again.  Then I received the coup de grace -- a BAD SERIAL NUMBER MESSAGE.  I checked carefully and it matched the serial number exactly as on the label sent by Adobe inside its factory package.  I used MicroSoft OneNote to make a colored screen copy of this phenonema and marched the package back to Staples where they refunded my money.  It's too bad about the 20 plus billable hours as a lawyer lost to this process.  My experiences in calling Adobe in the past when I puzzled through a far lesser discourage me from wanting to talk to their technical support people (who too often know less than me given the increasingly apparent out-sourcing to people who read from a script and give us credit for knowing far less than we do).  At any rate, I am now bitter.  My 7.08 installation of Adobe worked great on my favorite computer where I had the bulk of my multimedia presentations which I hoped to reduce complete with sounds to the Adobe 8.0 format.  I suspect that wrong serial numbers were slapped on the packages.  I am deeply disappointed, even ANGRY at the inconvenience this has caused me.  I took it home and tried it on my desktop there and it also would not complete the installation and ruined my chances of a clean uninstallation of 7.0.  Deactivation of 7.0 could not take place either after installation of 8.0.  I don't know what Adobe was thinking -- or if they were thinking.  I have been a loyal customer of theirs for many years, but I'm thinking distinctly non-charitable thoughts about them this early morning.  I hope they get their act together -- soon.  They owe us all a quick fix and patch and they need DEEP REPENTANCE for the damage this did to Windows XP home installations which also appear to be corrupted in the process of installing this "upgrade" program which acts more like a computer worm or virus than a program	neg

The cord-wrapped handle is a great idea, offering more of a real sword-like look as well as a firmer grip. My hands tend to get sweaty and slip around a bit with long practice, particularly with the sealed lacquered finish on most bokken. This wrap really helps (though it needed a touch of glue to get it to stay in place). The two-piece guard design is a nice enhancement too. Though you really don't need the guard at all for many applications it is nice looking and appears stronger than the original. ---  --- It's still a fairly cheap piece of wood, compared to an ironwood version, but at this price (it was $9.99 when I bought it) you really can't go wrong. A nice enhancement over the basic bokken. I do, however, prefer the natural wood version to this one as it looks pretty bad once you start using it and the color scrapes off. Nevertheless, if you want an inexpensive practice sword this one is recommended...	pos
Worked alright for a few months.  I wasn't especially pleased with the shave quality i.e. skin irritation, hair pulls.  I figured that this would go away as I was transitioning from a straight electric shaver to one with rotary heads.  It didn't.   ---  --- The bigger disappointment was that removing the head for cleaning out hair wasn't easy and resulted in breakage, no doubt due to the cheap plastic used.  Never again	neg
This was a present on our girls 3rd birthday... She rode off an on from 2 until 9 She loved it so much we couldn't wait for the battery to run out.

I bought this seat for my fifth child. She loved it at first, but then about the second week we had it, the plastic at the top of one of the legs snapped as I was putting her in it. Luckily I had not let go of her yet, because the whole thing fell apart on the floor.  The rattle ball also broke off within the first couple of weeks.

Okay, I am no Master Gardener, but then, this is not a product for a Master Gardener. I am also not wanted for botanicidal rampages. I bought this right after it first came on the market, did everything according to the instructions, found the perfect spot, etcetera, etcetera. About ten percent, if that, of the seeds sprouted, turned into little green shoots . . . and died. This herb garden is marketed as simple, follow-the-steps, sit-back-and-watch-it-grow. Not in my Universe! The only thing I admire about Chia Pet, Incorporated (or whatever the parent company might be named) is their skill at marketing. Each holiday season, as their commercials flourish, I am tempted. Then, I recall the Great Disaster of 1999, and I resist temptation	neg
This was terrible. I returned after hours with tech support and days of email exchanges with Apple Support Desk.  ---  --- The product will probably be better with future software updates, but in my experience, it was fairly unreliable in its current state. Examples of problems: wouldn't download drm managed content online, had problems when downloading itunes purchased music (the first time I've had that problem in 4 years of ipods and itunes), couldn't connect to my corporate VPN, and finally, just as evidence of the lack of QA on this device, the included instruction manuals were for the previous version of the Apple Extreme. The images were of the previous white, button-shaped device. ---  --- This was a genuine disappointment, and it seemed to stem from bad software and bad QA.  Others seem to have had more success, but I'm back on my 802.11g airport extreme and all problems have magically disappeared	neg
This is a great watch. The clasp is easy to adjust and takes only 10 minutes to adjust. It was shipped well before the estimated time and is in perfect condition.

I like the 05 version better. Sure this has updated playing rosters and the new quarterback function, but it doesn't appear to me EA sports have evolved much over the last 12 months or even few years for that matter.

Have a one year subscription to this magazine and will not renew it. Simply because its vulgar materialism to the extreme.  They say we Americans are obese in body, but magazines like this show to many are also obese when it comes to materialism.  Page after page of glossy ads for things we do NOT need.  And rooms to full of what amounts to dust collections.  Sure they make pretty pictures, but who wants all that 'junk' that probably has no real sentimental value but is more what someone else has told us we need to feel whole or successful.  I recommend the magazine Dwell which has a more holistic approach to a place to live that also wont mean hours cleaning.  For someone who professes to be so concerned about the down trodden, Oprah would do better to set a better example of living simply.

I've been using Murad for about 3 weeks now, and it has made a huge difference! I am in my early 20's and have had problems with mild breakouts since my teens. I've tried drugstore products, wich never seemed to make any difference, and Proactive which was so harsh it actually burned and made my skin much worse. Murad is gentle enough for me to use twice a day, and has left my skin breakout free! It has also improved the texture and feel of my skin, and makes my pores nearly invisible. I recomend Murad to anyone whose skin is breakout prone but too sensitive for the benzoyle peroxide formulas in other acne products. The only complaint I have about Murad is the price - it can be a little much for a poor college student - but the results are worth it if you can afford it!	pos
I agree with the other reviews.  My four year old received the ranch as a birthday gift - none of the pieces stay together - at all.  How do you explain why the gate won't hold together - why the horse won't stand up, why the barn doors keep falling off - and what do I say to the gift giver when they see it	neg
My son loves to read, and he adores this book.  I personally love Trapani's books--while they are not always grammatically correct (the only reason why I don't give it a 5 star rating), they are beautifully  illustrated and bring to life some of the most well-known nursery rhymes.   It will bring a smile to your child's face	pos
I was very pleased with the Quality of this blend, it contained the exact amount of sumac. It makes a perfect rub for Lamb. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the small amount for the price	pos
I purchased this after reading the reviews. I had never heard of it, let alone tested it. I had some gift certificates & thought I'll be impulsive. ~ When I first opened it I thought "oh no, this is going to be heady (or strong)".. but it seemed to 'change within seconds upon application, and got even better as it settled. My daughter wears vera wang princess, and she, too, loves Lolita. It's my newest fav & a possible signature scent for me. Will def. buy again	pos
I wouldn't recommend this movie, unless you have nothing else to do for the night and want to watch it alone. Due to a high content of bad words, screaming and violence, it's kind of embarrassing watching it with someone else. Some people really enjoyed it, and that's not me, and that's not the other two people I know who watched it. Some violent parts are a bit hard to believe, but I guess that's what the story is about. This movie is a bit of a hollywood-style suspense, with rather cheesy college scenes that are common to comedies.  ---  --- There's one good idea in this movie and that's how life develops as it goes along, and one action or inaction changes how life plays out. But this is no where near original, even the Simpsons had an episode like that.  ---  --- So, this movie is definitely not on my best movies list.	neg
If, like myself, you have many DX and VST plug-ins installed on your system, then Audition 2.0 is definitely NOT the choice with you.  Somehow, the idiots who made this junk have made it completely incompatible with 3rd-party plugs such as Waves Diamond Bundle.  Oddly enough, this was not a problem in earlier editions of Audition, or its former incarnation, CoolEdit.  But now, Audition crashes irrevocably when trying to use many VST and DX plugs (except, of course, the ones made by Adobe themselves.) ---  --- Bottom line?  This software is crap.  Absolute crap.  If you're serious about audio production, go with Wavelab.  Heck, even free multitrack audio software like Kristal works better than this. ---  --- If, for some reason, you absolutely need Audition, then go with an earlier, more stable version, such as 1.5. ---  --- 2.0 is about as useful as a football bat. ---  	neg
Following on from the fantastic 'The Duel' Allison Moorer's latest release 'Getting Somewhere' is a massive, massive  disappointment. --- Quite simply the material on 'Getting Somewhere' is weak and gutless.  --- On the rare occasions Moorer tries to emulate the beauty and feel of 'The Duel' - such as on Hallelujah & New Years Day - Earle rips the heart out of the material with such an amateurish, pedestrian and thin production that you feel cheated ! Business and pleasure rarely mix and Moorer should take a long, hard look at this release and give serious consideration to re-installing RS Field next time around. ---  --- If Moorer wants a guitar groove that burns , drums that drive and vocals that mesmerise then Earle is simply not the man for the job. ---  --- Moorer is a fantastic talent who has one of the finest female voices of any genre (she can write a mean song too ! ) . This CD showcases none of her abilities and should be consigned to the bargain bins immediately	neg

Based on lots of great reviews, I decided to buy Kaspersky.  After two months, I got a message saying my activation key was blacklisted.  I sent an email to customer service and got an auto reply saying they were too busy to respond within 48 hours.  Finally after three days someone got back to me and told me to try deleting and reentering the key.  This did not work.  I had to reply again to customer service and got the same auto reply. This time, no one ever replied.  I sent another email threatening to write negative reviews of them and they still, weeks later, have not replied.  I emphatically advise against buying this product.  If you ever have a problem, you will not get help	neg
I read Les Miserables after I saw the opera, and it has inspired in me more than any book I've ever read.  I don't believe one could ever find a better novel anywhere.  For everyone out there--read this now!!  There is a character that will touch everyone, no matter what type of person you are.  This novel is easy to relate to, and exciting.  It also give some insight to the unwritten history of the revolutions in France during Napolean's time.  I recommend strongly to everyone to read this book, and see the opera.  It really will effect your life	pos

I was very disappointed that the version of "Paper Roses" included on this CD is an updated and new recorded version from 1990.  It is not the original 1973 classic Marie recorded when she was twelve.Interestingly, this new version is produced by Sonny James, the original producer of the original single, that also features many of the original studio musicians.  So all is not lost. Still, I prefer the original hit version and am disappointed there was no indication that this CD included an updated "Paper Roses.&quot	neg

This unit is a workhorse for the money. I use it on my Corvette in the winter and in the summer I have my snowblower attached to the battery tender. This product is compact in size and simple to use.

There's not a lot of information out there on using this extractor for cars, because I think most people buy it for boats instead.  So I'm going to talk about how well it works on changing the oil in your car. ---  --- In summary, it works great.  It's really nice being able to change your oil on your own time and at your own home without getting dirty.  I'm never going to Jiffy Lube again.  It even works great on my lawnmower. ---  --- Using the extractor is very easy.  Just remove your dipstick, insert the extractor's tube into the dipstick hole until the end reaches the bottom of the oil pan (it might take some practice to get a feel for this part).  Once everything is in place, pump 10-20 times.  This will cause a the extractor to suck out the oil like a straw.  It takes about 15 minutes for 3 quarts.  That's also why I recommend the 6-liter model instead of the 2.5-liter one, so that you can suck out all the oil in one shot. ---  --- Some people wonder whether all of the oil is removed this way.  Unfortunately, I can't really speak to that, because that would require me to open the drain plug and investigate.  However, the consensus from stuff I've read on the Internet is that the extractor does remove as much oil as the traditional method. ---  --- Because changing my oil is so easy with the extractor, I always change my oil on time.  Previously, I drove for thousands of miles past my "due date" because stopping for an oil change was too inconvenient.  The extractor should be used after the engine has been running.  The oil is less viscous and the contaminants are stirred up, making the extractor more effective. ---  --- Also, please remember that your old oil must be properly recycled.  Most mechanic shops will accept your old oil (I put it in a plastic orange juice container), just call ahead to make sure	pos
My copy of "Reckless Nights..." (and yours, too, probably) has a sticker on front that reads: "One of the Most Influential Musicians of the 20th Century."  Well, I'm so glad that Columbia cleared that up.  Otherwise, I'd have had to make up my OWN mind, and apparently music labels don't allow that nowadays.  I hope similar stickers are included on Chopin, Mozart, and Bach CDs (with the century adjusted on a per-composer basis). ---  --- Scott's gimmicky fare makes for pleasant listening, but not in such a large dose--monotony sets in after two or three titles, let alone 22. Halfway through this CD, I felt as if I were listening to the drone of a defrosting icebox.  For all the outrageous hyperbole thrown at Scott--no one else like him, no way to categorize his music, and so on, and so on--the reality is that composers and arrangers like Ferde Grofe, Duke Ellington, Glenn Miller, Alec Templeton, and Bill Challis covered the same ground far more skillfully--and, in most instances, earlier--than Scott.  Concert jazz, symphonic jazz, or whatever you wish to call it, was NOT the invention of any one man, and certainly not Scott.  Check out Grofe's scores for Whiteman--in particular, his writing for woodwinds and his constant, Scott-esque use of muted trumpet.  Listen to Duke Ellington's "extended" compositions circa 1929.  For that matter, listen to Ellington's 1933 "Daybreak Express"--virtually the template for Scott's galloping miniatures.  Experience Bill Challis and Glenn Miller's pioneering big band charts.  Or... believe as you're told to believe, i.e. that Scott, and Scott alone, performed this kind of music.  I mean, who needs history when we've got hype?  It's up to YOU, dear listener	neg
I bought BHG Deluxe 7.0 software to plan an addition. I talked to the companies and shopped around before purchasing. I did not talk to IMSI about floor plan 3D, I gave up after trying to get through to a human. I would bet a guess the software is as good as IMSI's telephone skills. I talked to Punch Software and was warned away from their product by their own tech as I have integrated video on my computer. Apparently you need a video card with a minimum of video memory to render drawings with any usable speed using punch software. Punch Software's loss, not mine as that's a ridiculous issue for a consumer software product. Chief Architect offered a money back guarantee for their Better Homes and Gardens products, even if purchased via vendors like amazon. I'll keep this better homes and gardens home designer deluxe software, even though it does have it's annoying quirks. Even for a lesser package from the pro version, the library of items it very limited. I would guess there are quite a few more in the pro version, but it is odd to not include more of the most standard items that many home owners would need when laying out a home. You learn to just use a nearly matched symbol to fill the space, even though it is not the correct symbol or size of item. Since I am not interested in the 3D view, this is not a big issue for me. The item I needed most was floorplanning. 3D modeling is an extra item that I may play with, but is not essential for me personally. If you are truly interested in the 3D aspect, this is an issue. I would recommend visiting the product forum to see what is the best choice. [...]  For quick and easy floor plan software with a few extras, this software does better than OK. No experience necessary, and the short tutorial videos will get you started quickly. I have issues with not being able to have more control of wall types, and there are some odd roof design limitations even for a mid to low priced consumer package. These are annoying enough to urge an upgrade to pro if you want more  control of all aspects. Since I will be laying out the floor plan, then turning it over to an architect with real softare, it's not a problem for me. I have had a few restarts due to drawings getting all wild and messed up, but by ignoring the autosaved drawings, I was able to go back to my last manually saved drawing and start from a known good point. This software does have upgrade options to download from the company site. Just like any good software company, they do provide spftware patches to download. I would definately recommend this software as a quick way to do floor plans. Adding walls, doors, windows, and other items is very simple. Just don't plan on perfection, as it's based on prefabbed walls and is limited to whole inches, not fractions. Angles are an issue as well. If you need specific angles, this is not the package, it does preset increments only. I wish it had default preferences a user could select as well. Being able to preset your roofing style preferences or other items would eliminate quite a bit of redo's. I hope the software companies read these reviews. There is alot of good information on how to improve the products.    	pos
I tend to like just about anything that Brubaker writes.  While I'm not as excited about his Marvel work as most others are, I have enjoyed his runs on Captain America and Daredevil.  His work outside of Marvel has been great; Sleeper is one of my favorite series over the last few years.  In general, Brubaker had not written anything that I genuinely disliked.  Then came 'Deadly Genesis'. ---  --- In short, this is a weak story with several plot holes which makes a mockery of a franchise that already has a history of reworking established continuity to poor results.  To what end?  Another Summers brother who is completely disinteresting, another story in which Professor X acts like a jerk, a dead X-Men (for absolutely no good reason), and some horrible reworking of existing long running history to cram it all in which now require secrets to have been kept by several key characters for the last 30 years. ---  --- I want to think that this story was driven by editorial mandate.  Unfortunately, this is the second instance in which Brubaker has went back and altered Marvel history from long ago.  In Captain America, he made it so that Bucky never really died in World War II.  This initially rubbed me the wrong way, but the story itself was done well, and the surrounding plots were good, so I begrudgingly went along for the ride.  I was still able to enjoy his entire run on the book. ---  --- His attempt to revise history doesn't work nearly as well here.  The key difference is that Bucky had been considered dead for so long that there was very little continuity to adjust.  He hadn't been written into any stories during all that time, so it was very easy to go and insert an alternate history for him.  In 'Deadly Genesis', Brubaker inserts events into key storylines from 30 years ago.  In order for them to work, the reader needs to believe that several key characters has kept these events a secret from that time forward.  It just doesn't work. ---  --- To make matters worse, none of the characters' motivation for anything makes any sense at all.  Characters are keeping secrets, and other characters are upset with that, and through the whole you never understand why.  It's as if Brubaker had an end goal in mind, and simply crammed in any plot device necessary to get from point A to point B - even if it required characters to act contrary to their nature or the story didn't make complete sense. ---  --- That aside, another difference between the two is simply that this series is not written as well as Captain America.  They overall plot doesn't make complete sense and the characters are presented fairly shallowly.  Reading it was more of a chore than an act of enjoyment. ---  --- The interior art is nice, though not great.  Unfortunately, the book falls so short on story alone that the art warrants almost no consideration	neg
I have been using Lush products for a few years now. First introduced to them when I was in Australia. --- I always keep some in my linen closet as it gives a faint wonderful scent to all the sheets and pillowcases. ---  --- Try all of the bath bombs. I use the Tisty Tosty whenever I need an evening of self indulgence. Put the water on and watch the heart-shaped bomb fizzle and send hundreds of rose petals floating to the top of the tub. --- Put some fluffy bath towels to warm on a rail. --- Place some Dr Haushka's oil to heat by a radiator. --- Pour a glass of champagne. --- Surround the tub with lots of  tea lights. --- Put on some Rahman music. --- Get in and imagine a private Ganges. --- When you get out its very eassy to scoop up the petals- take the pre-warmed towels and wrap yourself in one. ---  ---  By then the oils will be warm and pour in palm of hand and rub on body.  --- I also like to put some  bath bombs in guest bedrooms with the towels-  --- If you haven't tried the Karma soap do try it ......alone or with someone special..	pos

I have gone through several smartphones in the past 4 months (Including, Cingular HTC 8125, and Nokia E62)  and can safely say that this is the best phone I have owned.   The Palm operating system is much easier to use than the Windows operating system ( albeit, less powerful) and much more customizable and synchronization-friendly than the Symbian OS.  Its great for easy installation of software. ---  --- Pros: --- - Very customizable interface, making the phone very user friendly. You can set any application or any number to dial as a preset button.  --- - Palm OS is easy to use, and thus, you actually get to take advantage of the many features of the phone, unlike Windows Mobile, which is definantly more powerful than Palm OS, but cumbersome and difficult to use at times.  --- - You can use this as a one handed phone...very important for people like me who like to drive and text/email.  --- - Perfect size, weight and feel of the phone in your hand and on your ear.  --- The lack of the antennae stub on this model is a huge aesthetic improvement. --- -  Easy synchronization with your Outlook mailbox or with the Palm Desktop  --- - Can set the phone to automatically retrieve your emails and alert you, which is very useful  (although limits battery life)  ---  ---  --- Cons: --- - Battery life is somewhat worse than other phones.  I have to charge my phone every night, and I probably use about 15 minutes of internet, 30 minutes of mp3 player, autoretrieve email every 30 min,  and 2 hour talk time as well as some other Palm functions.    If you have it set on auto-retrieve for your email, the battery life seems to decrease impressively.    The newer manufactured 680s have a fix installed for this problem apparently. --- - You cant plug in your own headsets into the device ( like your iPod headphones)  you have to use a specific headphone that fits and you can get it from Palm. I hate that.  ---  ---  ---  --- I suggest buying this phone unlocked from Palm, instead of from Cingular.  I got it for 350$  with a 1G SD card and stereo headphones included. Also,  if you get it from Cingular, they always ruin the look of the phone by plastering their logo all over both sides of the phone.   ---  --- OVERALL:  extremely satisfied with this easy to use, highly customizable, powerful smartphone, despite a somewhat shorter battery life.  ---  --- 	pos

I watched the first half hour of this and couldn't get through it. I dislike Michael Moore as much as anybody, but the fellow that put this piece together needs to go back to film school. It's an amateurish, whining documentary made more for spite (and those 15 minutes we all want) than anything else. Getting called down by Michael Moore at a public event and then talking to some sympathetic people outside (people who probably just had nothing better to do on campus that night) doesn't prove that Michael Moore followers are all waffling malcontents, dude. Overall, I rate this film FAIL	neg

This purchase was done by my husband.(Need I say more, ladies?) This soup(if you can even call it that) was a waste of money. There was hardly any seafood in it at all, and what little there was, it was in small pieces. It was more like 'cream in a can'. My son and husband are both big soup eaters, and love chowder. Let's just say that he bought a case of the stuff and 10 cans are still sitting in the pantry awaiting the next garbage day! I will admit that I didn't try it...it didn't smell or look appealing.

I've listened to this piece of work several times, in many positions, on various stero systems, during different moods and I just can't understand the lyrics half the time and the arrangements were best described as 'a wall of mud'. ---  --- It isn't a question of country music, or contemporary music, with ELH she has demonstrated throughout the years she just loves, and respects, GOOD MUSIC.  The music is good, the woman has impeccable taste but this time I had wished she sat in on the mixing process. ---  --- I think I understand the aim of this collection but geez, I wish I didn't.  I am too accustomed to hearing ELH's clear voice slice to the heart of the lyrics, take them and present them with a totally unique perspective.  I won't start on her own playing because this review would be nothing but gushing about her near-total mastery of her craft.   ---  --- She's an amazing woman, artist and collaborator -- I love her because she is everywhere in music: supporting new artists, doing background for others, her duets are gems of generosity with respect for her fellow artists, while always doing what's best for the song.  I just hope there's no follow up to WB.   ---  --- I'm very happy with my other 8 ELH cds and I'm in awe of 'All Roads Running' and my [...]is going to be front center next week in Los Angeles.

This cable really cleaned up the display image. I had been running another Monster Cable - the 6 meter version. I needed the length before because of the way my system was configured. I have a review under that cable about how quality does matter. ---  --- And so does length. At the time I wrote the review I was just ordering the cable and was posting what I had found out in researching digital video signals. Everything in there stands true. ---  --- I changed my setup and decided to invest in a shorter version of the cable - the 1 meter version - because I could now get away with a much shorter cable. I installed it this morning and the difference, while not earth shattering, was definitely visible. ---  --- I use this cable to connect between the video card on a media PC and my TV (Sony rear-projection LCD). The image used to swim a little along the edges of some windows, text, etc., and the image wasn't as clear as I had hoped. While the image looked good, it didn't look great. That's why I decided to take the plunge and spend an extra $79 bucks. ---  --- The difference is somethine like going from a regular RF feed to your TV and component video cables. Now the image is crisp and clear and there is no swimming. It actually brings out detail I couldn't even see before - to the point of deciding to turn on FSAA and filtering so video games have a more realistic look. And that they do. ---  --- I don't know how other brands compare to the Monster Cables as I haven't tried them. What I do know is that signal integrity is very important to a good looking display. You can get that with high quality cables and by keeping the length to the absolute minimum required as there was a very perceptible difference just between the 1 meter and 6 meter versions of the exact same thing. ---  --- One more thing while I'm here. I want to thank Amazon for going the extra mile on customer service. I had a DVD disappear somehow during shipping. UPS said they delivered it but I never received it. I asked Amazon if they filed the report with UPS or I did to file a claim. What I got was a reply telling me a replacement was already on its way. That is service. Thanks Amazon	pos
This Skagen watch is full of class, yet it's perfect for casual wear too. Very thin, so it's not clunky like a lot of other watches. Titanium black... and the band is black metal as well.

Etta never fails to deliver in the vocals. Gutteral bombast, sweet soul, gospel, blues, the lady is a living legend. But this album, like the last album "produced" by her son, is a nightmare. Chessy arrangments, tinkly bass, poor sound all around. She is a fierce mother and I'm sure she thinks her kids know best, but there is a reason why labels pair vocalists with the right producer. Should Etta get the chance to work with a fresh ear at the deck, she wouldn't need the novelty of some of the song choices.  --- PS - 200lbs lighter and she remains the best live performer; blues, R/B, soul, whatever,  in the world.	neg

Elaine Pagels is a wonderful writer.  Her explanation into early Christianity is wonderful.  It is definitely worth the time to read this.

Interview is definitely a different type of magazine for me- someone who usually reads business and travel mags- and it's not quite what I expected. With a title like "Interview" I read my first copy of this magazine anticipating pages and pages of nothing but interviews. It turns out that interviewing is the main focus of the magazine, but it's not the only one. There is substantial space given to fashion, movies, and other areas, too. Some of these columns are worth an occasional look, but they failed to grab my attention. The writers seem to play it safe, and that includes the interview section. They don't ask many daring or controversial questions. They keep it simple, asking questions about an entertainer's latest album or movie, without delving much into their personal lives.  ---  --- Interview has many general annoyances. My greatest complaint is the advertising and the arrangement of the contents. About half of the pages in each issue are covered with ads, with fashion, liquor, beer, and hair care items providing the bulk of the advertising revenue. The ads are everywhere, with the majority in the front pages of each issue. The table of contents is buried, and I find this very frustrating. The contents starts with the interviews for that specific issue on one page, then a few pages later, proceeds to the remainder of the contents, which is the regular monthly features. What's annoying is that you have to search for the table of contents. It varies from one issue to the next, falling somewhere in the first half.  ---  --- Interview also varies greatly in length. Some issues are as short as 80 pages while others are more than 200 pages long. The shorter issues use staples for binding while the longer issues are bound in a more professional way, minus any metal.  ---  --- This magazine centers on entertainers, fashion, music, and the like. You won't find any interviews with politicians, businessmen, etc. Interview sticks strictly to entertainers, and that includes the regular monthly columns. You won't find a column about the business side of the music industry or film industry. You will find only articles about the stars themselves.  ---  --- Interview's only saving grace is the photography. It would make a nice gift for those who enjoy fashion and who like looking at pages and pages of men and women modeling fancy clothing. But in many ways, the photos are overemphasized and there isn't enough substance to the magazine. The articles are very shallow with more eye candy than reading material.  ---  --- Overall, Interview is sloppy and cluttered with too many ads to make it worthwhile reading material. My subscription was free, and I'm thankful that it was. Besides a few nice photos for clothing, there isn't much to make this magazine worth the cost. 	neg
This is another fly by night workout machine that looks great in the pictures and on videos but when you take it out of the box, you realize that it is poorly and cheaply constructed. I own a ton of excerise equipment and this is the only piece of equipment I have had to return...I have purchased so much on the internet this past year and have been very happy with all of my products. That is until I purchased this Ab-Doer which was a TOTAL waste of time and money.  ---  --- The tension on the arms of the unit is way too flimsy and loose...The foam around the arms is also very cheap foam in fact my daughter used it "once" and there was already a small chunk of foam that came off the unit...She does not even have long nails...The bars that connect the seat to the bottom of the unit stay in place ok when your on it, but they do not lock in the base when your not on it so if you pick-up the unit to move it, it collapses...  ---  --- What's really bad is the so called back massager that is located on the main area of the center stem. It does nothing but hurt your back and is worthless...Even adjusting the bar for different heights is a joke...It's a screw, not a quick disconnect...  ---  --- This is one of those products that make a ton of money by mass advertising but will quickly fad out fast unless there are MAJOR changes done to this unit...It's sad when you watch some of those excercise info-mercials that have all these people with great bodies that may be fooling you into believing that the products really work... ---  --- I couldn't find any reviews on these until now...I will never again buy a product without reading reviews from the customer themselves. We are the best source of honesty on the market...Save your money or just do some sit-ups and leg raises if you can...They work SOOOOO MUCH BETTER than this product !!!  ---  --- If you do some searching, you will see some of the BAD reviews about this product that are coming in...Based on Amazon's review rules, I cannot list where I read them from... ---  --- Have a Great day everyone !!!  --- 	neg

This is my first digital picture frame, so I do not have anything to compare it against.  I am generally very happy with this product - it is very easy to use, and I am happy with the resolution and the picture quality.  ---  --- The only downside to this frame is that the instruction manual is not helpful at all, and as one other reviewer noted, I had to learn how to do things by trial and error.  I also do not like that when you make changes to the layout - rotating or deleting images, it is not "saved" to the memory card and so you need to make the changes each time.   ---  --- However, I like this product enough to buy more of these for the grandparents this next Christmas	pos
You can put up to 6 shelves inside to fully use all the cubic space available. But you may just need 4 and leave the lower two open for big size items to be stored. Rubbermaid has a similar size shed but it can only accept three shelves and waste a lot of spaces. The Rubbermaid shed uses much fewer pieces to assembly than this one. The assmbly is pretty easy if you follow the manu but it does take some time (1-2 hours). After I finished the assembly there were some rain and the inside was try except a couple of water drops. The only concern is its sturdiness since it's assembled with 28 pieces and so far so good. I don't expect it can stand a ternado or hurricane. One thing I wan to alert you: when you buy the shelves do measure the inside and ignore the manu since if you buy the side according it yuo will find the shelves will shift too much to the left or right. You want them more stable, right? ---  --- Recommended.	pos
Twinings was founded in London, England in 1706, and has a long and respected tradition of producing only the finest of teas. English Breakfast tea is a mixture of black teas from Sri Lanka, which are blended to produce a smooth yet flavorful tea. Though often served during breakfast, this tea tastes excellent all day long. ---  --- OK, let's get down to brass tacks - this is another great tea. Harder to over-steep than some of the teas I have known, it consistently produces a smooth and highly drinkable cup. Highly conventional in its taste, English Breakfast tea has a robust flavor that stands up well to lemon and milk, which makes it a favorite among those who like to accessorize their tea. Plus, I must say that this tea is wonderful iced - add some lemon and sugar, and you've got the right tea for a hot afternoon! ---  --- And that's my review. If you want an excellent all-round tea, hot or iced, one that goes well with any food, then English Breakfast tea is for you. If you want tea from a great tea producer, them Twinings is for you. I highly recommend Twinings' English Breakfast tea to all, even those not normally into tea drinking. (Or, perhaps especially to those not normally into tea drinking!	pos

I'm a big fan of the high-end Flukes so I've worked with the best. Well, these defintitely aren't the best, but you can't beat what you get for the price. I got it for my brother for his car and it does the job well. ---  --- First, the bad: --- 1. No auto shut-off. You gotta make sure you turn it off or the battery will just keep draining away. --- 2. No auto-sensing. You gotta set the dial for the range you're looking for. But hey, I like it so much I don't care that I can't be so lazy. ---  --- And the good: --- 1. All the features. You get all the standards PLUS a tach and a dwell-meter! That'll about cover your carbureted cars. --- 2. Price. You can find multimeters that can't do the extras for the same price and even more. Great bargain. --- 3. Alligator clips. Simple things but it'd be a pain without them. ---  --- Plus, this thing will handle all the home electrical work. ---  --- As for the rest: I won't vouch for its durability but Actron is a decent company. They go towards affordable but not junky. The case is made of a light plastic, but it doesn't seem fragile. As for the tolerances, they're not bad: --- DC Volts  --- Range:  200mV, 2V, 20V, 200V  --- Accuracy : ±(0.5% rdg + 5 dgts)  --- Range:  1000V  --- Accuracy: ±(0.8% rdg + 5 dgts) ---   --- AC Volts  --- Range:  2V, 20V, 200V  --- Accuracy : ±(0.8% rdg + 5 dgts)  --- Range:  750V  --- Accuracy: ±(1.0% rdg + 4 dgts) ---   --- DC Current  --- Range: 200mA  --- Accuracy: ±(0.8% rdg + 5 dgts)  --- Range: 10A  --- Accuracy: ±(1.2% rdg + 5 dgts)  ---  --- Resistance  --- Range: 200, 2K, 20K, 200K, 2M  --- Accuracy: ±(0.8% rdg + 5 dgts)  --- Range: 20M  --- Accuracy: ±(1.5% rdg + 5 dgts)  ---  --- Dwell  --- Range:  4CYL, 6CYL, 8CYL  --- Accuracy: ±(3.0% rdg + 5 dgts)  ---  --- RPM  --- Range:  4CYL, 6CYL, 8CYL  --- Accuracy: ±(3.0% rdg + 5 dgts)  ---  --- Audible Continuity  --- Buzzer sounds at approximately less  --- than 30-50 Ohms. ---  --- So for the price, a good deal	pos

After going through nearly 6 mouses (including several of the Microsoft mouses), I settled on this because its round contuour shape and large effective button area that extend very far back.

This item is invaluable in preventing Plagiocephaly (flattening of the head)...I wish we had known about it for our twins.  Newborns especially need a very soft surface for their very soft and malleable skulls.  We used it for our third baby and as a result, he has a perfectly round head and proportioned features.  The incline greatly reduced spit up as the 'flap' between their esophagus and stomach is not developed yet.  Gravity prevents the milk/formula from traveling back up and causing gas and or spit up.  I've noticed the biggest complaint about this item is that infants seem to slip down in it during the night.  This is true, however, rolling up a receiving blanket real tight and placing it in a "U" shape under our son's bottom prevented this from happening ever again.  As a result, he slept soundly, never spit up once, never woke us up with gas pain and has a perfectly round head.  I strongly recommend the Boppy Noggin Nest as well to keep the pressure off the head when your baby is not in his crib.  Also, if your baby is old enough to roll over, this item is not for you.  One other note: the foam wedges on either side do trap some body heat, so don't over-swaddle or put too many layers on...adjust the thickness of your blanket to the ambient temperature.  I would say this is a good item for newborns to about 5 months. It made an enourmous difference in the well being of our third child compared to his older twin siblings	pos

Most of the world still runs on PCs and as a Mac owner (and lover), it can be tough to find software for basic stuff like accounting.  I'm a guy who makes a living making stuff sound good for radio, TV, video games and so on.  As a freelancer, I need something to keep track of my business banking, credit cards, expenses and invoices and this program does just that and very intuitively, just like my Mac.  --- I used MYOB--a Mac accounting program--but found it to be tricky and didn't end up with the comprehensive reports for my accountant that I expected and wound up going over everything expense by expense and invoice by invoice for hours.  It could be that I didn't understand the program well enough, but support is extra everytime you call customer service for help, so no thanks MYOB.  In fact, I put off doing most of my 2006 accounting until January 2007 because I dreaded trying to figure out MYOB again.   --- Then I broke down and bought Quickbooks for Mac.  It did everything I needed it to--a year's worth of accounting in a weekend and I never even cracked the manual.  It allowed me to save the year as a PC file to hand to my accountant on a CD.  A few days later he handed me back a CD with a Mac file of my adjusted accounting and my corp taxes were done and sent.   --- I can't speak for anyone with really advanced accounting needs because I never got that deep into the program, but for my needs it's right on the money.   	pos

In Europe, you find a bowl of dark flaxseeds to the side of the muesli set out on a breakfast buffet. A great source of Omega-3 oil, you can improve your health by eating these tasty, nutty seeds. They are good for the gut and good for the heart. ---  --- The golden seeds are an attractive alternative to the nut-brown seeds. They look nice in baked goods like lighter breads. They taste the same as the dark seeds. Ground, they don't show up in white bread, so you can bust some up in the blender and throw then into your standard bread recipe and add needed nutrients and fiber. ---  --- We like them sprinkled on oatmeal, muesli or yogurt	pos
This thing is being advertised as Dance Dance Revolution.  It is NOT DDR.  It is just a cheap knock off not worth a penny.  My daughter plays a DDR at afterschool and loves it.  She received this for Christmas, tried it once and gave up within five minutes. She said, it says fifty songs but it plays just one.  Well, the 50 "songs" all sound the same.  They are not "radio" or "stereo" quality, rather just computer generated noise.  Totally awful.  Having tried it myself, I am very disappointed and don't blame my daughter for not giving it a second glance.  Total waste of money and total false advertising.  This company should be investigated.  Believe the poor reviews and skip this product!!!! 	neg
I'm in charge of a weekly touch football game where we use an official NFL football from a previous year and I wanted to get another one for backup. I know 'The Duke' is supposed to be the official NFL ball from this year, but there seems to be something wrong with the balls Amazon is shipping.  ---  --- The first ball I got from Amazon was hard as a rock, slick as all get out and had poor stitching in the laces. I got a second one and the stitching was a bit better, but it was still hard and slippery. And when it was exposed to rain, the ball stained the hands of everyone who touched it with red coloring. I have no clue if that's to be expected or not since it's all leather but it seems odd.   ---  --- In any case, you can grip the ball with a good pair of sticky football gloves, which also help mitigate the pain of catching the ball. So, it is usable and throws a nice spiral but maybe I play ball with a bunch of wussies cuz no one else wants to get near that thing out of fear of breaking their hands (which is kind of annoying given how much i paid for the balls).  ---  --- Maybe the footballs just need to be broken in, but I'm not really sure how to do that aside from playing with them, which no one seems to want to do. I've tried to let some air out to make the things more user-friendly, but it doesn't really help.  ---  --- Anyway, I find it really hard to believe this is the ball the NFL played with this year. Something about them just seems cheaply made. In any case, I suggest you save some money and go with a decent composite leather ball. 	neg
I bought this software two days ago, Installed it on my laptop and all of a sudden, my network connection was messed up. I could not figure how to connect to the wireless or wired network.

After much work, I finally uninstalled the software and right away was able to get back on the network. I am not sure if there is some kind of firewall setting with the software, or if it was just the software itself. ---  --- Anyway, I am unsure whether to reinstall this software or not	neg

I called Garmin tech support yesterday (10/17), did wait about 15 minutes to speak to someone.  I called in the morning so it wasn't a long wait.  Since my nuvi is still under warranty (1 year warranty) I requested a RMA for a replacement suction cup mount.  The tech asked how it had failed -- mine also had melted to the windshield so I had to rip it off -- and responded like he was very familiar with the problem.

I didn't have to pay for it and should get here in 7-10 days	neg
I totally love this DVD! They really show how to do grooves, not just some moves that you can only do to a specific music video. These are grooves you can make  your own and go and dance any where with. That what I think makes this DVD series totally different from the rest. The moves are current and fun and the host and dancers are excellent dancers and also fun to watch. It goes slow enough and they turn around backwards to show you how to do it. LOVE IT!!! LOVE IT!!! LOVE IT!!! I am hooked on the Groovaloos	pos
I ordered enough Stevia packets to last me for 1 year. Most of the packets have the sugar hardened.  Every so often I am finding one that is powder as it should be.

I found these diapers while searching for the 7th generation brand diapers. I was impressed and eager to try Tushies because there was no chlorine and no gell used to produce them, I ordered the medium size for my 20lb baby.

It seems like no matter how tight I can get the diapers my son leaks through them, out the sides and up the belly. Because the moisture does not wick away from his skin he also developed a diaper rash- his first and we have been only using these diapers for a week	neg

Everybody I know loves this film. In today's environment, when WKW is being hailed as the premier director from Asia, and one of the world's best, I don't know how many really actually love the film, and how many don't have the courage to state a contrary opinion. Make no mistake, I think WKW is one of the greatest directors I have ever watched - how can somebody who makes a movie like "In The Mood For Love" (ITMFL) not be? Actually, his greatness lies not just in his ability to make a movie like ITMFL, but in his versatility. It is almost impossible to conceive that the same person made both ITMFL and Chungking. Well, his greatness notwithstanding, I can't stand this film. And no, I can't sit, lie, or do anything else with it either. ---  --- So what is it about this movie which gets my goat? The directorial style, and the cinematography. Actually, I think parts of the latter are great, and the parts I don't like are influenced by the former, so let me just talk about the former. WKW uses a particular style which extends across most of his other films, including "Happy Together" and "Fallen Angels" (yes, I've seen all of them, and hate almost all of them uniformly). The hallmark of this style is a very modern, staccato, piecemeal approach, stringing together relatively disparate ideas, scenes, or action sequences (almost reminiscent of Godard's "Breathless", as the editorial review says here, though not quite). His style is further marked by characteristic filming styles - for example, the slow shutter speed effect. Actually, this is one of his peeves, which even spills over to ITMFL, where it oh-so-doesn't-fit-and-stands-out-like-a-sore-thumb. Having watched nearly all his films, and having seen the wide array of situations across which is deploys this mechanism, and having spent hours analyzing the potential connecting theme, I can assure you that there is absolutely no uniformity and sense to its usage. It gets used for dream-like sequences, for grounded reality; for sentimental togetherness, for aloofness; for tears, for laughter; for thoughts, for action; the list goes on. WKW similarly uses other weapons in his vast director's repertoire to some bizarre effects, taking improvisation to an extreme where it stops being laudatory. ---  --- The above notwithstanding, let me round off by saying that if the kind of style I have delineated above appeals to you, then you should definitely watch this film, for outside of his jarring style, WKW has pieced together a great story and actors. As for myself, I will continue to watch every one of his films, living in the suspense of what this genius will do next - make me fall in love, or hate. --- 	neg
Born in Steventon, Hampshire in 1775, Jane Austen was one of two daughters of the Reverent George Austen and his wife Cassandra. She was educated in Oxford and in Southampton, finally attending a boarding school in the Abbey gatehouse in Reading, Berkshire. The environment provided by her home was conducive to writing and she often enacted plays for her family, something that gave her the opportunity to present her stories and develop the characters in depth.  ---  --- Jane Austen's works are imaginative, full of emotion and depicting relationships that transcend time. Jane Austen wrote about society, about propriety and about etiquette. She was highly critical of the snobbery with which the upper classes kept away from others. Her study of human flaws and prsonal relationships provide great material for the development of her characters. ---  --- Jane Austen wrote Pride and Prejudice in 1813 and it still enchants audiences all over the world. The first time I read this book, I read as a child, back in Cuba, "Orgullo y Prejuicio."  ---  --- The writings of Jane Austen shaped my perception of true love as I identified with the love between Elizabeth Bennet and her one and only, Mr. Darcy. With this BBC adaptation completed in 1996, I have been able to relive the experience of exposing myself to a classic, one of the best books ever written. With this BBC miniseries we feel as though we were reading the book, for the adaptation faithfully follows the author's writing.  ---  --- The filming is magnificent, offering us a view of gorgeous scenery, magnificent castles, and locations that bring the book to life, for we can see what we expected after reading the book. The love story presents the struggle of the times, as two individuals fall in love, regardless of class differences, or status, and yet, the antagonism and friction created as a result of said differences. Darcy is a wealthy single man who, upon meeting the family of Elizabeth, boisterous, non-polished, and simple, believes her to be beneath him. The meet at a dance where his best friend falls in love with Elizabeth sister, but Darcy thinks he knows Jane's heart not to be true to these emotions. Elizabeth overhears a conversation during the dance and feels insulted by the proud and distant Darcy, keeping her distance and yet, without her awareness, falling in love with him. Jane Austen is masterful at creating enough tension to keep us all in suspense as to the path these lives will take as some members of Elizabeth family make the wrong choices.  ---  --- The dialogue is almost verbatim to the book, making this series a true delight for those of us who identify with this work. Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth and Colin Firth as Darcy provide magnificent interpretations of this timeless classic, keeping us all dreaming of ever encountering love of this magnitude in our lives. As with most DVDs that we own, we watch by selecting English subtitles, which enhances the viewing by allowing us NOT to miss a single word said by the characters. Who would want to miss a single word in this marvel of the English language? There is a documentary as an additional bonus, where interviews with cast members are included... simply awesome! Interviewed are:  Jennifer Ehle [Elizabeth], Colin Firth [Darcy]. We also get to see those who played Mary Bennet [Lucy Briers], Mr. Collins [David Bamber, Mr. Bingley [Crispin Bonham-Carter] and Mr. Wickham [Adrian Lukis]	pos

I bought this as a backup drive several months ago for my home business after the iomega backup drive I was using crashed and took my backup with it.   ---  --- The Maxtor software installs automatically when you plug in the drive so that part was really easy and it took just a few minutes.  The initial backup was really easy and went pretty fast too.  So far, so good.  The problem is that once the initial backup takes place the backup function doesn't backup new or updated files!  ---  --- The scheduled backup doesn't work at all.  The light flashes so you think it's working but it doesn't backup ANY new or updated files.   ---  --- The synch is useless too.  It's like the backup function.  It will synch your files one time but then after that it doesn't synch any of your new or updated files like it's supposed to.  It's like it takes a snapshot of your computer at a specific time and that's it.  ---  --- To get around the fact that it won't automatically back up my files I have to manually transfer my files every few days or so which is a real pain as I have to remember what files have been updated and/or are new. ---  --- I would NOT buy this product again.  It's not an automatic backup drive, it's just an external drive that will back up one time but then isn't reliable AT ALL.    ---  --- If you need a backup drive look elsewhere. Sorry to say, this one is a complete waste of money.	neg

I wanted an automatic watch for a while, and I was attracted to the green trim on this model. The watch is big and heavy. This is probably true of most automatics. My issue is that it seems to be too thick. I think the glass/crystal back adds a millimeter or so.  --- The band has a slight problem that I can probably fix. Right where the metal of the band contacts the case, one side of the band has bent slightly causing the band to interfere with the rotating bezel. I may have caused this when adjusting the linkage, or it may have come delivered that way. I think I could simply detach the band and squeeze it back into its proper shape. I have actually left it alone as I do not want the bezel to rotate, and the defect is not visible. --- As far as accuracy, it seems to have gained about 20-30sec in a week.  --- Had I seen the watch in a store and tried it on, I would probably not have bought it. I was not happy when it arrived, but I have worn it for a week, and I am now glad that I picked it. --- The only other issue is that I wish the luminous markings were brighter. I purposely picked the black face to be easier to see the markings in the dark (as opposed to the white face), but I have had better luck with other watches	pos

So many books on the market about pregnancy focus on the medical aspect of what is growing in your wife's little belly, and not how that little thing is changing your wife and life forever! This book describes to a 'T' how this life changing event reeks havoc on everyone involved in the process, and it does it in a way that is bust-a-gut funny. Before I read this book, I was like "what the heck is wrong with my wife?"  After reading this book, I was more like "Ohhh, I know why she just ripped my head off... she hates the smell of carrots!"  Great book, fast and fun read, a must read for a new dad. I've bought it for every father to be, and they in turn have done the same.	pos
I agree on "it was too good to be true" statement for this package. --- The material used for earbud and the charger is really cheap !. The  --- charger melted in the car after a sunny day, I couldn't even test it. Earphone quality is not good as well, giving a constant humming noise. The case is the best out of these three so far. So one out of three for 10 bucks. I am not recommending anyone to buy this item. 	neg

It started 31 years ago...when my in laws, from Washington came for a visit (to California), bearing gifts.  A wonderful treat called Market Spice Tea.

This software might be recommended if better utilities weren't out there. This one gives the user a sense of security, but when my system crashed, Fix-It couldn't. I dutifully put in the Rescue Disk, booted up on it, restored my earlier system, exited and rebooted. ---  --- Nothing. Before I'd been able to get into safe mode, but now nothing. So when I manually restored my system, guess which program got yanked? And it freed up a lot of system resources, too. (Had I known how much before, that alone would have soured me.) My system now runs faster and doesn't lag while typing. ---  --- Another small criticism: Even though Fix-It has automatic update for virus scans, I found more often than not I had to go to the VCom site and manually download the anti-virus files. No reason was ever given; I'd just get a message telling me to do it. Very inconvenient. ---  --- Also WARNING*WARNING: This program has strict activation. You can only have it on one computer, so forget putting it on your notebook computer.  ---  --- Finally, be careful when cleaning your registry. Look at every entry this suite wants to delete. If you run it on default, it may remove critical registry keys and settings. In fact, I'd use a different registry cleaner or some of the free ones.  ---  --- Fix-It has some great features, but not enough to make it worth the system resources and a system sluggish system. (Not to mention the anti-virus problem). Try System Mechanic instead.  --- 	neg
I love this show so much!! IT just has so much passion and beauty and all the cast members sing so well!! Sutton Foster as Jo, was cast very well, its obvious she deserved that Tony nomination in 2005, and the sisters, even though they weren't the leads, they all had such great songs, especially Beth, whose song, "Some things are meant to be" always brings tears to my eyes,its just so touching. I would definitely recomend this CD to anyone who loves musical theatr	pos
Well its definetly improved version since the last one, but they still have a lot of things to do.  The biggest problem is Pages.  If text has specific symbols, like Greek letters and u try to export your file to doc, forget it.  u'll have the same problem as 10 yrs ago, either funky symbols or underline dashes.  Keynote is much better.  But if u r a scientist and not a sales man, both packages still have a lot of room for improvement.  However, I'm still happy with this purchase, because it's Apple soft and looks much nicer than any MS software will get in the future	pos
These breast pads are sooooo different from the Johnson & Johnson product.  They don't absorb your milk, which means it still gets all over your clothes.

This game set it of amazing quality. Every piece has so much detail it just looks good without doing anything! The Dubloons are the best part, and like others have said, make the BEST clinking sound when you drop a pile into your hand. ---  --- This game is definately worth buying.... IF you come up with some new rules that make the game more interesting. The gameplay is very uninteresting, boring, and brainless. My wife never passes up an opportunity to tell me how boring it was, and even her younger (12 year old) sister thought it was boring and had more fun playing with the pieces. My wife says I should have bought us Settlers of Catan instead of spending my money on this (before we got our own set... now we have one), but when I bought it I knew it would be just for the game pieces. I am brewing up some good rules to change the gameplay dramatically and make it much more interesting. She likes Settlers so much.. maybe I will get some trade of spices into the game and whatnot. ---  --- Anyways, if you are creative and have a good idea for a ship game, then DEFINATELY get this game set. It is high quality and beautiful. But, if you don't have the interest to make your own game, then pass this one up because you would most likely love to play any other game you own before this	pos
In general I'm a big fan of movie music, but to tell the truth I expected more from this one. This soundtrack is incomaparable to say Lord of the Rings or Star Wars movie music. It lacks depth and emotion and power. Unlike emotionally potent melodies present in LOTR soundtrack the Eragon is pretty dull and uninteresting. I get the impression that the entire album is in fact a variation of a single theme called Eragon. I get the feeling that entire album has only one very long and boring track. I hope they'll make better album for the next movie of the Inheritence Trilogy.	neg

This album is essentially a fusion of great musical minds.  The legendary Khan payes more attention to making this a better experience for the western audiences of the Sufi music by playing more with his (brilliant) vocal skills then with the lyrics.  Micheal Brooks' music stands out and enhances the experience further.  This is not to say that the mainstream Indo-Paki audience won't enjoy this album ( This is one of my all time favs).  It is fabulous background listening while doing work which may need focus - for those who need music to do such things... :)  ---  --- For those who have been thinking of testing out Sufi music, this is the place to start.  This is a fine introduction to the great NFAK and Sufi music. 	pos
I got this bracelet for my boyfriend. Initially, I was looking at two different designs, but I'm really interested with this one. I made up my mind to buy this bracelet.

I don't know what the complaints about this product are.  It seems that people are trying to use it for extreme hold hairstyles.  This is not the purpose of this product.  I use it for my short haircut to make the ends stay spiky and styled out, and it works WONDERFULLY.  No matter how much you move your head, it stays in place, but somehow moves enough to keep you from having a stiff look.  And, when you brush your hair out at the end of the day, it feels like you never put it in.  Hair stays soft and feels clean.  The reason why this gel is thinner is that it isn't as sticky or goopey in your hair as other gels.  And it spreads out easier	pos
Here's an extremely stylish, different film panned by almost all the professional critics which means here's another example of why they should be ignored. You are better off reading the reviews of people here at Amazon. ---  --- Being one who appreciates stylish film-making, I thoroughly enjoyed the images and the sound on this movie. I found it absolutely fascinating. Being a male, it doesn't hurt that Ashley Judd stars in it, either.  ---  --- To be fair, I can see where the story would turn off a number of people.The co- lead, Ewan McGregory's character, is odd and not very credible. k.d. lang's character is unlikable, there is some stupid numerology as part of the story and the ending is unsatisfying . ---  --- Yet, despite the above, the story is very involving and the visuals and sound (5.1 surround) are just so good that they way outweigh the negatives. ---  --- The movie flat-out entertains, which is the name of the game.	pos
For years now I have been buying "bargain" cameras with the foolish notion that I did not need a nice one. Finally, I got sick of it and bought the Exilim EX-Z600. This camera is awesome. The screen is huge, the picture quality is great, it is easy to use and is sooo small. Overall, a great buy. ---  --- The one downside is that I can only connect it to my computer using the dock. Luckily, I have an SD card reader, so I normally just use that to download my pictures	pos

The cable set that comes in this item is what ought to have been included in the Airport Express.  This comes with a 2 meter RCA-ministereo, a 2 meter Optical-ministereo, and a 6ft power cable.

Sometimes I feel like I've been on a diet forever. Of course, I haven't been -- I've been on and off one or another, then back again.  ---  --- I don't believe any tea is a wonder cure for everything, but I find tea helpful in managing my appetite, my stress levels, and outlook on life. I drink this Oolong tea, really enjoy it, and suspect it helps me feel less hungry in the midafternoon.  ---  --- I've heard it's rich in anti-oxidants, and promotes the burning of fat. It may well be. I've lost bodyfat and weight -- but, again, I believe the result are due to a combination of factors that includes regular exercise, counting calories, and taking time to for a deep breath and a warm cuppa	pos

Renowned artist and tarot scholar/writer Robert M. Place has produced a masterpiece in his new tarot 384 page companion book, The Buddha Tarot Companion: A Mandala of Cards. This book affords a rich unique perspective of the Tarot through the lens of the Buddhist paradigm. The companion deck comes in a beautifully illustrated box containing exquisitely designed cards that fit perfectly in my hand, a tiny black gossamer bag plus a bordered little white box with the instructions, "Embellish this box with protective and/or empowering symbols." Other suggestions that greet you as you begin your journey with the Buddha cards include: "Smudge with sage to cleanse and re-energize the cards after a reading." and "Store your deck with stones or crystals that absorb negative energy, promote healing, or provide protective energy." Also included in the box is a mini-book with guidelines on reading these particular cards. Both items are published by Llewellyn, who as always, have taken great care to ensure quality and aesthetics in the way the cards are packaged and presented. ---  --- Robert has done an amazing job in correlating the life of the Buddha with the Tarot journey through the cards. He describes how the Major Arcana fits perfectly with the life of Siddhartha and his journey of enlightenment. Each of the tarot trumps is a stage on the mystic's journey to enlightenment. In fact, it is Mr. Place's belief that the creators of the Tarot were directly influenced by the life of the Buddha, and incorporated archetypes into the Major Arcana based on his journey. He teaches that the ancient wisdoms were not isolated from one another. Instead, "the classical world maintained communications with India and the ancient Western philosophers were familar with Indian philosophies." As well, the Islamic world introduced the Christians to the life of the Buddha during the Middle Ages. "The European Christians were enamored with the story, and they transformed him into a Christian saint - St. Josaphat."  ---  --- I was fascinated by the titles given to the Major Arcana cards. Each of the 23 cards reflect an important aspect of the Siddhartha's personal journey to become the enlightened one, the Buddha. ---  --- Robert Place has created a deck and book that not only meets the needs of people who practice Eastern beliefs. He also acts as a mediator to help people of the Western world learn about and appreciate the noble tenets of Buddhism and its teachings for life. I highly recommend this deck - I found it very easy to follow, the graphics are amazingly detailed and artistically rendered and the companion book clearly helps you to learn to "read" using a Buddhist world view.  --- 	pos

I have several Kathy Smith videos this is the absolute worse! I agree with some of the other reviewers that Kathy has not rhythm and in this video the steps do not match the beat of the music which makes it frustrating and makes her look very uncoordinated. Also, it seems like there a too many people in such a small space, the whole set looks very chaotic. I wonder if Kathy thought up the choreography for this one herself, it is very poor. All those crazy shuffle moves! Any other Kathy Smith workout will be better for you than this one.	neg
The legend goes that there was a time a few decades ago when "The Gramophone" was the unquestioned authority for reviews of recordings of classical music. ---  --- Whether or not that legend is true (I'm too young to know), Gramophone's time has definitely passed. Today there is a multitude of sources of free information on classical music on the internet, from newsgroups to websites. Some of it is less well-informed than Gramophone's criticism, but some of it is more well-informed. What is undeniable is that, for the price of a few mouse-clicks, it is possible to find a far greater range of reviews of recordings on the Internet than Gramophone (with its British-based critics) can offer. ---  --- What is more, Gramophone is tied to a business-model for the classical music industry that is fast becoming obsolete. Historically, the most important classical recordings were issued by a few so-called "major" companies such as EMI, Deutsche Grammophon and CBS (later Sony). These "majors" would buy lavish advertising spreads in Gramophone and so finance the magazine. In return, Gramophone would devote lengthy reviews to the majors' new releases and would produce pages of fluffy interviews with musicians under contract to the majors. ---  --- Today the situation is different. The most interesting new release is more likely to appear as a MP3 on an obscure Russian website than on a new CD from Sony. Small companies, dedicated solely to classical music recordings, produce great results on shoestring budgets while the "major" corporations have virtually abandoned new classical recordings. ---  --- This development causes problems for Gramophone's business model. The new players in the classical music industry don't have the publicity budgets to fund a glossy magazine like Gramophone through advertising. With Gramophone's implicit bargain: "advertise with us or we won't review your recordings", the magazine seems to be becoming more and more irrelevant. ---  --- If you want to subscribe to a classical music periodical, I recommend "International Record Review" or "Fanfare". Both offer substantially more reviews per month than Gramophone. But most of all, I suggest checking out the huge range of classical music information available for free on the web and usenet	neg
I have always been a fan of Sony because they make quality products that are "user-friendly".  That is why I was in a state of complete shock that this little blue cd walkman is made by Sony, because it is on the other end of the spectrum compared to what they usually manufacture. ---  --- First the bad...the control buttons (sound, changing tracks, pause, etc) are tiny and nearly impossible to read.  I found myself having to hold the cd player up to my face to find the right button, and I do not have any vision problems.  The little lcd screen is hard to read as well.  Next, the sound quality is poor and has a cheap "watered down" feel to it.  Then there are the stock headphones that the product comes with.  These are cheap and don't fit well. ---  --- I bought a yellow "psyc" sony walkman a couple years ago, and that one is 3 times the product that this one is.  The sound is near-perfect and the buttons are easy to see and use.  The headphones fit well and the whole package has lasted with no issues at all. ---  --- I wouldn't write sony off simply b/c of this product, but I would definitely do some research prior to purchasing a walkman from them. 	neg

Another gadget I had to have.  For the price, this is a really neat outdoor thermometer that shows the high and low temperature of the day.  One important note is the location of installation.  I live in S.Fla and mounted it on the north facing window.  You must locate it in a spot where direct or even somewhat direct sunlight does not affect it as this will most likely give false readings.  If you have a glass door or window that leads to a screen enclosure, this would also allow for a fairly correct temperature reading, although this could also cause improper readings in the heat of the day as the metal pan roof can reflect heat to the inside of the screen enclosure. --- All in all, I love mine and reccomend it. I bought 10 of them at Christmas and gave them out as gifts	pos

This is very good roasted seaweed.  Excellent, in fact.  Most companies just dry their seaweed but let me tell you, they are lazy and really don't know seaweed.  See, that's the problem with most of the world today, laziness!  I can remember a time when companies and people cared about going the extra mile, when quality still mattered.  It's a shame.  Everyone is all about speed and convenience, speed and convenience.  It's like we're all on treadmills or really fast escalators or something quick and automated like that.  I just don't know what is wrong with everyone.  Sometimes I just have to sit down and shake my head.  ---  --- Roasting makes the seaweed almost taste like chicken and when you use it in your favourite recipes, you will think you've died and gone to heaven.

I myself is a Proform treadmill customer and tortured by their customer services. I also found some reviews on the internet mentioning their machines broke down in several months after purchase. (Mine in three months.) The strategy of the customer service is basically make wild guesses of what went wrong and send you the parts asking you to replace it by yourself. (In one occasion, they even asked me to take off the motor and find a local garage to test the motor to see if it's good.)These back-and-forth guessing games normally drag on for months, and eventually they claim the warranty expired and they can no longer serve you, even though it's still within one year. --- I believe you are looking for a treadmill for exercise, not to practice your debate skill over the phone with some customer service keep saying: "this is our policy.	neg

I counted 12 ingredients that were really just forms of sugar!  It is also loaded with salt.  I would give this ZERO stars if I could, because it has more sugar than most "sweet" cereals.

I don't know what to say about this book. It is the single worst book I have ever read in my young life.  I feel like I've witnessed a horrible tragedy and am at a loss for words to describe it.  I would say at some point in the book, maybe about halfway, every line of dialogue, every characterization, every plot point, is absolutely terrible.  This book is truly an offense to literacy, and I cannot understand how a publisher of any merit or author could publish and print this trash.  I can only imagine that Robin Cook either allowed a child to write this book,or was chronically drunk while writing it. Either that or he has lost his faculties altogether. I have read children's essays that have been better written. --- While it would take a novel to explain all the problems with this book, the highlights are: --- -knowing the mystery 50 pages into the book and being forced to painfully watch the dumb characters discover the mystery --- -cliche mania with lines like, "I going to get to the bottom of this mystery" and when the character's discover something, giving each other high-fives. --- -racist remarks about blacks living in harlem about how they like to steal televisions, own guns, and play basketball. --- -stereotype characters such as mafioso that like to eat spaghetti and named dominick and vinny. --- -incredible suspension of disbelief when the heros, nyc coroners, fly off to africa on a moments notice because they want to finish their case of a dead body. (also paying for their friends to come too) --- -wandering around the main installation easily where the evildoers are working, and asking questions, and getting answers to them real easy. --- -incredible annoying characters that make inappropriate jokes. (i.e. making sarcastic remarks to a guy holding a gun on them) --- -the book spirals into total madness in the last 50 pages to a beyond implausible ending. I got a sense whoever wrote the end of book was on sleeping pills when he wrote it. --- If anyone thinks this book is better than two stars, they need their head examined.	neg
During the time I was considering buying this model, I happen to see the same thing at a local department store; so I bought it. I couldn't wait to take it back. --- I wasn't impressed with the cheap plastic. The pump came with the adapter pre set for a Schrader valve; my tires are Presta. The blister pack says it can be used for both and indicates all one has to do is to take off the "round end", remove and reverse the plastic adapter, re insert and then screw on the cap [tight as per the label]. Seemed simple enough, so, I took off the cap, took out the plastic insert [I noticed it is in 2 parts], reversed and re inserted and then replaced the cap. When I put the end on the Presta valve and then pressed down on the "thumb part", I couldn't help but notice that the plastic would not grab the valve, but was loose. So I decided to change back to the Schrader type [and use my adapter valve]; maybe this would be a tighter fit. So, I took off the cap, and tried to remove the insert, but only one part of it came out; the parts separated; I could not remove the "bottom" half. I was not going to force it out. I put the parts back together, re inserted them into the blister pack and returned it. No thanks !!! --- I gave this product 1 star only because of the way this review process is set up; it doesn't deserve any star or any consideration for purchase	neg

As mentioned, this book is amazingly compact, cramming three semesters of calculus and a bit of ordinary differential equations into just 800 pages. That conciseness also implies that much explanatory material and many illustrative examples are missing. ---  --- The authors mention in the preface that "classifiers of calculus books would call this a traditional book. Most theorems are proved or left as exercises to prove..." Nearly every result in this book has an accompanying proof. For those with a serious interest in mathematics, this is a useful resource. For most others, the presence of so many proofs can be overwhelming and probably is a turnoff. ---  --- Included with the book is a one-page detachable reference card containing a massive amount of valuable information, including common rules for derivatives and integrals, geometric formulas, a few conversion factors, trigonometric identities and graphs (very useful!), and more. The book also has a three-page comprehensive table of integrals in the inside back cover and a listing of geometric formulas in the front, along with a commemorative timeline and portraits featuring the deceased European males who made calculus possible. ---  --- Given all of this, I would highly recommend this book as an 800-page calculus reference text, or maybe as a text in an honors calculus sequence that expects to use the text throughout multiple semesters - then using it saves you money. ---  --- But for those who don't have a super-strong background or interest in math, those who are just taking calculus for a requirement or those who have never seen calculus before, or for those who are just plain math-phobic - using this book just doesn't make any sense. I wouldn't recommend it. ---  --- For those who are stuck with this book for a course, I'd suggest looking for another book to help you out. One possible book has already been mentioned in another review: Silvanus Thompson and Martin Gardner's "Calculus Made Easy", a book that dates back originally to 1910 (!). I've read parts of it, and the book looks good to me. ---  --- I'm sure that there are many other helpful books; try checking your local/university library or looking on Amazon for ideas. An extra calculus textbook that's more student-friendly might be a good idea. ---  --- As for the pages falling out, I haven't had a problem with it (I have the 8th edition), but I don't use the book all that much. ---  --- I haven't found any serious errors in the text, but I haven't read everything thoroughly, having only used the text for Calc III. ---  --- And, yeah, getting the student solutions manual would probably be a good idea	pos

First off I own both NBA 2K6 and NBA Live 2006 and have been playing both since they have come out.  At first I thought that NBA Live 2006 was a better game until I played NBA 2k6 more and more and realized that it was the best simulation basketball game out there.  The addition of the shot stick to this year's game changes the way you shoot as well as play the game.  The game is very enjoyable especially with friends because some of the games can get very intense.  Overall the game is probably the best in the series because it made a major improvement over ESPN 2k5. ---  --- Pros --- -Graphics are the best of any basketball game on the PS2 to date. --- -Free throws more realistic in that you must have a fluid motion as if you were shooting the free throw yourself. --- -VIP is very extensive and detailed to show your stats and tendecies which is a very nice touch to those that pay attention to detail such as myself. ---  --- Cons --- -Steals happen way too often. --- -Very challenging to get 15+ rebounds. --- -Practice mode is still relatively useless other than to perfect your timing on your shot.	pos
Conde Nast Traveler is a magazine for the wealthy or the want-a-bees.  The magazine is geared mostly to North America and Europe.  It tells where to eat, shop or be seen on the two continents.  For example, an article will inform the reader of a new five-star Sushi restaurant in Florence, Italy.  Thus, if you plan to travel to Florence for Sushi (not Michelangelo), this is the magazine for you.  It is a great coffee table magazine for the armchair traveler, for the pictures are gorgeous. ---  --- 	pos
Im going to rate this product a 2 because I like it but I would change a few things if I could.  It does show you a lot of chords and how to play properly and all that good stuff.  The couple of things I would change is the fact that when they are teaching you a chord, you can play along with the program but its only about 15 seconds, then  you have to stop and click play again.  I wish there was an option where  you could choose to repeat it on its own a few times so you dont have to stop every time to play it again.  The other thing is something a little more important.  The product has a program where you could go online to down load a lot of songs to play, its called OLGA.  Well this website is having legal problems and is not online anymore.  So you dont have that option of learning to play your favorite songs from the Beetles or Metalica or The Grateful Dead or anyone else, and thats what they advertise "Play hit songs". So overall, knowing all this I would have shopped around more.  Especially for the price, its defenitly not worth 40-50 dollars when all you get is little 15 second examples on jingle bells and little traditional folk songs. 	neg
I bought this camera a year ago, the camera is goog only for outdoor use with a lot of light, but for using indoor (with flash) is very, very bad. When you use flash the photo are not good, but if you go to beach this may be a regular choice, if you can bought another camera.	neg
I do agree that the quality is nothing to sneeze at.  These fill me up, I know that they're pretty good for you, and I like the nutty essence too.  I guess that I really was disappointed in the taste, though.  The chocolate was slightly bitter-tasting, and took me by surprise.  I love the other flavors, but this one is my leat favorite.  I would recommend the almond butter balls before this one, they're soft and a little more on the sweet side	neg
I give it two stars for the Snorkel, the mask and the fins are just JUNK!!  --- The Mask: The mask is a purge mask...meaning it has a small disk that, in theory,lets you blow any excess water that enters the mask by just blowing. The problem is this, any speck of debris that gets caught between the disk or a simple malformation will cause water to constantly enter the mask. AND if you happen to suck in via your nose you'll definately get a mask full of water. ---  --- The Fins: The're a strap type fin which is good BUT they are so tight you can't wear any dive booties or dive socks which comes in quite handy if you're walking over coral, rocks or any other sharp objects. The biggest issue with the fins is the strap comes off while swimming. This set was for my wife and hers came off I didn't think to much of it until mine did too. You might say, buy smaller fins but they run in a Size x to Size X so you can't buy any smaller.  ---  --- The Snorkel is ok, It's a little short but it works	neg
The information contained within this book was extremely out of date with a strong emphasis on steroids. It is a shame there are not more current and useful books for pet owner out there on this widespread problem.	neg
I thought this would be the ultimate gym bag. The main compartment is too narrow. Your shoes will not fit side by side, you have to stack them. The pockets do not expand wide enough and are not deep enough. The zippers are cheap and stick. It is very pretty but not very functional. My $16.00 bag works much better. --- 	neg
My kids really like to eat this as an after-school or late-night snack.  However, they like it best when it has been heated for 90 seconds instead of the 60 seconds recommended on the package.  My oldest takes it to high school as part of his lunch because it is so quick and he has only 30 min for lunch	pos
This kit is just junk. The "deluxe blower brush" is a cheap plastic blower in the tiniest size. There is a "tweezers" that is just folded aluminum sheet metal - there's no way that is getting anywhere near my cameras. There are a few sheets of lense tissue and a few swabs to use with the cleaning solution. The "lintless cleaning cloth" is an about 3" x 5" piece of something akin to reusable paper towels that you'll use about three times and then throw away. This kit is not worth buying at any price, because it's not worth the shipping charges	neg
I bought this camera for myself at Christmas. It is my first digital camera purchase. I love the clarity of the pics. I love the shutter speed! --- I do wish the lens cap would stay on better, but that is so minor compared to my likes of the camera.	pos

I tried as hard as I could but just could not get into this book.  Not quite as bad as her book, "Impossible," but close.  Danielle Steel is getting so repetitive in her writing.  Basically, this book repeated over and over how much Quinn liked sailing and how he neglected his wife throughout the years and that he didn't realize how much she meant to him until she was dying/dead.  Drivel.  She could have elaborated on what was supposedly the storm of the century but ended it quickly or expanded on the characters themselves, but no.  A waste of time.  Very hard to get through as there really is nothing there to get into at all.  Disappointing, to say the least. 	neg
I am no pro at grilling, but this grill makes it all so easy!  It was easy to put together, easy to use, and easy to clean up.  Everything I toss on it turns about perfectly grilled and absolutely yummy!  There are cheaper charcoal grills out there, but if you're a petite woman, like me, who doesn't grill for a living, it is well worth the extra money for the little conveniences of this grill.  I got the 18 1/2 inch grill, and it has plenty of room for preparing dinner for 4-6 adults.  Since putting my grill together, I have cooked out every weekend	pos
I have read every Hiaasen novel, except "Flush" and "Naked Came the Manatee." I have enjoyed reading almost every one of them [There are exceptions -- "Basket Case" definitely was not up to the mark, IMHO]. The best among them, in my opinion, are  "Strip Tease", and "Double Whammy." "Double Whammy" is funnier among the two. "Strip Tease" is a little more serious. ---  --- This is one novel I read once in a while whenever I get the urge to laugh out loud. Those characters are crazy	pos
I pulled the lid of the Philosphy Vanilla Birthday Cake bottle and inhaled the wonderful smell of vanilla birthday cake.  It smells 100% like its glorious namesake.  While some people complain about feeling strange bathing in birthday cake or a strawberry milkshake, I think of it as being just another type of aromatherapy.  Cake makes me happy, birthdays make me happy, this birthday cake smelling body wash and shampoo really makes me happy!   ---  --- Plus as a bodywash and shampoo it functions very well.  My skin feels smooth, and my hair feels light, silky and not weighed down.  My hair still smells a little like birthday cake, which isn't as good the second day, but it's not overpowering.  I don't think I will use this as my everyday shampoo, but it is great to throw in a gym bag for a quick after-workout shower	pos
We (my husband and I) brought this toy for our 2 year old last Christmas because then she was an Elmo fanatic. She still plays with this toy even though her intrests have shifted to Dora! At first I wasn't quite sure what this thing did except make noise but as I watched her play with it, I realized it taught her to follow directios. --- It's a mode where elmo asks you to follow the light and the keys light up one by one as you press them and I was truly amazed at my baby actually following the directions. --- This toy also teaches numbers. Overall, this toy is great for toddlers and tends to stay a favorite unlike those toys that end up at the bottom of the toybo	pos

This game did what the prequels couldn't for me... it drew me back into the Star Wars universe with a vengence.  I am not a real big gamer, and really don't like console games but this game is a must have for any fan, casual or hardcore.  Knights also comes in a PC version for those who don't have access to a console or like me don't really care for them.  In fact the PC version has more Mods available for it I believe so I would probably recommend it first. ---  --- Knights, or Kotor as it is known in the fan community is set 4000 years before A New Hope.  It's the sweeping tale of a talented Padawan who comes late to the Force and holds the fate of the galaxy in their hands.  Since this is an RPG the best part is the Jedi is YOU!  What really drew me to this game was the well developed storyline and the flushed out characters.  The other members of you party have backstorys that play directly into the plot in the form of sidequests during the course of the game.  You almost feel like they are real and I found myself becoming emotionally attached to the party memebers as the story progressed.  Their responses are also influenced by your dialog choices, and can even affect the main character's relationships with the other party members.  This is a Bioware game as well so there is the option to romance one of the other party members.  You can also choose which side of the Force to follow.  The player can either be the quintessential Light Jedi, evil as Palpatine, or somewhere inbetween.  Your choices throughout the game affect your alignment in the Force and also what powers are less exhausting to use. ---  --- The dialog is fantastic and rarely comes off as cheesy (unlike certian prequals which shall remain nameless) and the voice actors who portray the other characters are wonderful.  Even the dialog for the main character has the option to be funny without necessarily gaining you dark side alignment.   ---  --- The game gives you the choice to play as a male or female character which actually influences what side quests you can pick up, as well as having a minor effect on the main story.  Personally I thought this was the most gratifying aspect of the game.  I got to play as a kickin female Jedi who holds the fate of the galaxy in her hands.  Due to this as well as the ability to choose your alignment there are four possible endings to this game. ---  --- Knights has been able to hold an excellent replay factor as well due to the number of Mods available for the game from other fans.  LucasArts actually encourages and even supports fan mad mods on thier website.  When you get bored with the main storyline there are mods out there that change everything from looks to clothes to Force Powers and even dialog.  There's even a Mod out there that restores the cut fifth ending that was only available as a female character. ---  --- The game mechanics are pretty easy to get a handle on.  The combat options give you the ability to either choose what attacks each character in your party use or leave them automated.  Those who aren't real familiar with computer games should be able to pick up the basics fairly fast.  Those who like first person shooters may find it a little frustrating as the attacks themselves are automated.  For me this was a plus as I'm not a fan of "button smashers." ---  --- A work of advice to someone who hasn't played the game or isn't familiar with it's storyline, avoid searching on the internet for info on it as much as possible.  This may be frustrating if you are someone who likes getting walkthroughs but believe me, the storyline's twist is not something you want to spoil.  You'll enjoy the game storyline much more if you don't spoil the surprise.  There are gaming sites where you can get cheats and only cheats if your a cheater like me. ---  --- Not only will teen players enjoy it but I know plenty of 20 and 30 somethings who adore this game.  It does a great job of capturing the feel of the Original Trilogy.  If you like Star Wars at all, run... don't walk and buy this game	pos
This isn't a full review but some thoughts I've had after using it for a long time. --- Stabilization- The fact is that if this is the camera you take everywhere with you, you are going to either lose shots or have to use the flash. If flash doesn't bother you, no sweat. But I've never like the look of it. --- Ease-of-use- Great. --- Voice memo- I use this feature all the time. It would be nice if it had a pause button because without it I end up with many small files. --- Ex- This is where you set the exposure. Casio does a great job putting everything in one place. The only thing they should have done better is that if you have changed a selection (e.g. ISO 200 to 400) and hit the shutter release it should take the shot. Instead nothing happens. You have to click set first. It's an extra step that you have to make during a critical time	pos
I spend hours pouring over reviews trying to decide which ultracompact was the best deal and the best overall camera.  In the end, it came down to Panasonic's FX01 and Cannon's SD600.  I read the warnings from other reviewers that the Panasonic's images weren't top quality, but I chose to ignore those reviewers because on paper the FX01 looks like it would out perform the SD600.  I was wrong. ---  --- After using the FX01 for a few days I knew what those other reviewers were talking about - grainy photo after grainy photo.  I really really wanted this camera to be great, but it just wasn't.  Actually, my old 3mp camera took better shots then the 6mp FX01!  Very disappointing.  I ended up returning this camera to Amazon (very easy-great service) because of the poor image quality.  I mean, wanting good photographs is why you take photos, right?  I know someone with the SD600 and he's very happy with the quality.  Judging by the customer images on the SD600's page on amazon, I think I should've gone with Cannon	neg
This was a great movie.  True the Cube was a trap but it showed the greatest danger was the people inside. ---  --- If you do an indepth look  you will realize  all the names of th epeople inside the cube are names of prisons in 4 different countries, and furthermore  their personalities decribe what the prison is like. ---  --- Kazan (autisic guy) come from  Kazan Prion in Russia  which is a psychiatric prison ---  --- Alderson  comes from  Alderson prison in West Virginia.  This prison commonly uses isolation as a punishment.  Alderson died alone having never ran into anyone. --- Rennes  comes from Rennes Prison In France.  Rennes was kinda the groups mentor.  He showed them 2 tips on how to survive, the  ---  group took these as policy.  Rennes Prison is where most of modern prison policy originated. ---  --- Holloway comes from Holloway Prison in England.  Holloway is a prison for women ---  --- Leaven And Worth come from Leavenworth Prison in Kansas --- Leavenworth has stict rules so does math wicj Leaven is a whiz at. --- Leavenworth was bulit corportely by architects.  Worth was an architect. ---  --- Quentin comes from  San Quentin prison in California.  Both Quentin's are brutal. ---  --- The makes of this movie really did their home work to make those connections. --- The plot was good also,  total strangers  with their memory of how they got there wiped out have to rely on each other to survive	pos
Extremely dissapointed in the colors I received.  Out of 10, 6 were black, 3 red (2 shades), 1 pink.  I could deal with 6 blacks and 4 different (and I mean different - not all red-toned) colors, but not with what I got.  Useless. ---  --- I'm upset beyond words.  Will never buy from this seller again, and will not recommend to anyone I know, unless the seller comes through and fixes this	neg
I have had a Weber Silver B grill for several years.  The grill is great, but the steel flavorizor bars rust and have to be replaced (I replaced my bars twice in five years).  I have just started using the SS bars, but I am sure they will be better than the old bars, and well worth the extra initial cost.  If I had been able to get the SS bars earlier (not usually available from local markets), I probably would not have had to replace the bars as I did (twice).  I highly recommend spending the extra dollars for SS bars when the originals fall apart	pos

I was skeptical when I first heard they were making a "Freddy vs Jason" movie. The chances of getting it totally wrong seemed quite high. After viewing the film, however, I was pleasantly surprised. The plot makes a twisted kind of sense, the performances by Robert Englund and Ken Kirzinger are inspired and enthusiastic, and the special effects are top-notch. ---  --- As a Nightmare on Elm Street fan, I was pleased that the movie seemed to fit the tone of previous Nightmare movies. I was, however, intrigued by the Jason backstory and scenes. Since then I have become a fan of the Friday the 13th pictures also. ---  --- If you like either franchise, you will most likely enjoy Freddy vs Jason. Even though the final battle might not end the way you would prefer	pos
When I tried this program out, I at first had some trouble running it. But Then I went to the website at: www.kutoka.com and click on the support tab and then select EasySpeak Spanish. They give you a link for the version of Flash 8 you need to run. After this everything worked well. ---  --- While some may have been offended by bathing suits. Not me and not my kids. There is absolutly nothing obscene here folks.  ---  --- This program is the best thing going for learning spanish quickly! And it is fun to use with the many games and puzzles that you work out with real life scenerios. Very artistic and fun. You can go to the bank, the hospital, and several different places, learn a new set of words and situations. that you could really use in a foreign country. My hats off to the designers and creators of this program. Well done!! Bravo! Muy Bien. 	pos

Metheny's an innovator and has been all over the map over his long career in terms of styles, moods, textures, and sounds. ---  --- Here we have an early effort in which he takes his guitar and overdubs an introspective, wide-open-spaces musical journey across America, weaving in jazz, folk, country, rock, mountain music, and everything in between.  If you love his work on Joni Mitchell's Amelia (performed live on Shadows and Light), you'll love the sound of this record. ---  --- The mood is mellow but not dull, quiet but not silent, and the results are spectacular.  This is the cd to take with you on a trip across the western frontier, or a short hop to Burger King.  Works either way	pos

Isn't it frustrating when a book spends a lot of time building up the problem-to which you say, "Yeah! yeah! That's me!" and then gives you no answer, or a weak one to which you say, "No duh!" I'm afraid this book is one of them. The title is misleading because you assume he will help you find the life you've only dreamed of, or at least point you in the right direction to get started! But I was left depressed after reading it because it basically says that God gives us desires that we can't have on earth so that we will long for Him and Heaven. I don't believe that's the abundant life Jesus promised. So I went to the Bible. (I should have gone there first!) I looked up every time it talks about desires and got my answer. "Delight yourself IN THE LORD and He WILL give you the desires of your heart!" Ps. 37:4 So I set out to seek Him. I started reading "Knowing God" by J.I. Packer and began to get answers to all my questions about desire! I hope you'll find them too-in Him	neg

I've had multiple PDA's that have crashed and multiple phones in the past.  I had a great Nokia phone, but wanted to combine into one unit so I decided to try the Dash about 6 months ago.  So far, I've had no issues with service.  Been able to make and receive phone calls, call clarity is excellent and with TMobile, I have service in my office unlike other co-workers phones.  Everyone is jealous - their pda phones are much larger and not as nice looking.  I really enjoy having the email and internet feature.  The only issue I've had at all is with the volume control - when I'm surfing the net or playing ball breaker, I hold the phone and often hit the volume control.  Everything else works as described and I'm very happy with my choice. ---  --- When I was looking to combine my phones, I was comparing this phone to the blackberry and after reading many reviews, I picked this one.  I'm very happy I did. ---  --- [...	pos

I bought one of these items in December '04 from Adorama.  It had directions written in raised letters on the canister itself.  I just ordered here and received a second one in March '07 and the "new" model has no instructions.  Other than that, it looks identical to the old one, so I assume the contents are the same. --- Here are the exact words written on the old one: --- "HYDROSORBENT 40 GRAM SILICA GEL" --- "WHEN PINK, REACTIVATE 3 HOURS AT 300F" --- The pink referred to is the little circle in the center of the canister. ---  --- I keep this product with my camera (in closed stuff sack) and it seems to work as advertised - though I guess you just have to have faith that it does - no easy way to prove it (except maybe in extremely humid climes)	pos

This game matches with the real thing quite well, but has too few questions to endure.  If you've never seen the show, it's simply a series of fifteen, each increasing in dollar amount until the last, million-dollar question.  It's drawn out.  There's a speech clip for each dollar amount, answer, and other things.  The infamous "final answer" option only appears when you take a while to answer, unfortunately.  The lifelines are realistic, minus the fact that "phone a friend" is really "phone Regis's friend".  The "fast finger" scrambles the choices, and the first correct key pressed wins.  The graphics are pretty good and there are neat animations.  I recommend this for Millionare fanatics or trivia people, but only those who won't run out of questions	pos
this ramp is terribly designed for a skateboard. First of all, i thought this would be a bit larger.

If you are considering purchasing this item for use with a skateboard,i recommend something else.	neg

I was very excited to hear that this new Muppets Holiday offering was coming!  The previous two Christmas albums ("A Christmas Together" w/ John Denver & "A Muppet Christmas Carol") have long been family favorites at hour house in December.  However, this time I am disappointed. ---  --- Most of the songs performed on this cd include voices not done by the original puppeteers that made them famous.  I realize it is impossible to perfectly duplicate the voices to match the puppeteers that are no longer with us.  But, to focus on these voices so much (Kermit, Rowlf, Dr. Teeth, Statler & Waldorf, The Swedish Chef) in this album, only produces a disappointing reminder that the "Muppets" we grew up with are long gone. ---  --- Maybe I am being a little hard on this cd.  But, there are plenty of Muppets they could have focused on for this project that are still performed in the original voices (Robin, Sam, Honeydew & Beaker, Rizzo, Louzeland, etc).  Those voices added to those of Ganzo, Miss Piggy and Fozzie would have made for a more familiar feel. ---  --- There are a couple of good cuts on the album.  One is "Merry Christmas" by Pepe.  The other is "Santa Baby" by Miss Piggy. ---  --- Sadly, over all I can not recommend this cd.	neg
I have been looking high and low for a fragrance that wasn't strong.  I have tried so many perfumes and body sprays it is ridiculous.  I have finally found the one I will use for more than a week.

I was amazed.  Also, I noticed that they told me I smelled good.  They didn't say your perfume smells good.   ---  --- I am not sure how to describe the smell.  It reminds me of that out-of-the-shower fresh smell that we wish we could have all day.  I will never use any other fragrances but Philosophy fragrances.  I plan on trying all their other wonderful scents as well	pos

I love this cleanser!!! I have combination skin and I sometimes have breakouts, especially when I am stressed. This cleanser is great because it sloughs off the dead skin without irritation. I also love how it doesnt dry out my skin! And I have a lot less breakouts now, and when I do, its not as bad as it used to be. Even if you have sensitive skin, this cleanser is perfect, of course there are other great cleanser options if you think this will irritate your skin. Also, this cleanser really helps to minimize/clean out your pores. I really noticed a difference after using it for only a week. --- I also recommend the Perfecting Lotion especially if you have slightly oily skin. I use it during the day and even at night(!)because it really improves my skin and I dont wake up with zits in the morning :)Plus, It saves me money since i dont have to by an acne treatment gel to put under my lotion	pos
It's to bad I can't give negative stars as this package certainly deserves them. This program is total garbage. A gargantuan waste of both time and money.  ---  --- Seemingly with every menu change, it recatalogues your entire photo collection, on ALL DRIVES, which takes HOURS (like 12+) to accomplish. And, while it will scan and catalogue all of the drives on your computer, don't even think about selecting a folder and expecting it to display the contents of that folder and all of it's subfolders. Ain't a gonna happen... but is will happily go through and catalogue them again for you, but, of course, after waiting hours for the software to finish catalogueing, it doesn't display the contents.  No, that would be way to logical. ---  --- After realizing that my computer had slowed to a crawl, I checked the memory usage and found that the Corel Photo Album 6 Deluxe was using 6 to 7 times higher than any other program running, and that includes Norton Internet Security, a notorious memory hog! Guess we now know what the DELUXE part is! ---  --- As far as I am concerned, Corel Photo Album 6 Deluxe is neither intuitive nor is it the "Best of" anything. It is a creeping, bloated dinosaur and a total waste of your hard earned money.	neg

I have a 6 month old who absoutely loves this walker.  We started using this when he was only 4 months old and being the wiggly, active baby he is, he loved being able to push himself around. Now, along with his "walking", he loves to push the buttons to hear the music and see the lights.  Along with that, he likes to pull and pet the plush toys on the side while "chatting" with them.  This is a great walker; just always remember to keep an eye on baby at all times! I highly recommend this for those babies who love to move around on their own.  It also provides mom and dad with about 25+ minutes of catch-up-with-to-do-list time!!	pos
I bought a couple of Bob vidoes through Amazon for my son, age nearly 2, who loves the series. We were crushingly disappointed by these videos, though. The wonderful voices of the UK version (Neil Morissey et. al) have been replaced by American voices. WHY do they do that? For us it means the videos are unplayable because they just ain't Bob. British shoppers and anyone familiar with the original Bob should be warned. (Can I get my money back?	neg

I finally got a DS and one of the first "older" games I tried to hunt down for this wonderful system was Phoenix Wright.  I've been "Jonesing" for this game for awhile now.  It's unique and entertaining.  The choices for the court sections can be kind of linear but it's too much fun to not "love" this title. ---  --- This is the type of game that makes the DS so unique and proud to say that "I own this system".  More games should take note and follow in it's footsteps.  This is a must buy for any DS library. ---  --- Other titles in this type of catagory that are must buys are: Trauma Center and Trace Memory. ---  --- This system was made for these types of games.  These games are why I will always trust in Nintendo for high quality and interesting games.  Game on!	pos

I bought this scale as an upgrade from a Wal Mart cheapo scale.  Hated it!!  I should have read the dimensions more carefully, but it was so large that it became the focal point of our bathroom.

This movie is high in my top 10 off all times list, and is probably the best 'mainstream hollywood' movie I can think of. I watched it for the 3rd or 4th time and it is just as enjoying, thrilling and suspenseful as it was when I saw it first more than 10 years ago. My 12 years old daughter watched it with me for the first time and enjoyed it just as well. Great performance by all cast but especially Hanks, Paxton and Beacon. Probably Ron Howard best film ever	pos
Norton is still the 800LB. Gorilla of Antivirus software, but I think more and more people are realizing that bigger does not mean better!   --- The old days when Peter Norton made an excellent antivirus program are long gone, and these days Norton is just a mass produced product of Symantec's. --- Customer service is through an Internet Database, and you must pay over $40 just to speak with someone even when Norton lets you down and lets a virus slip in.  The biggest problem is that this program is a huge hog of system resources.  It is no wonder that the ratings are so poor on Norton these days. I bought Trend Micro's PC-Cillin and have not looked back.  There product is less expensive and includes free phone support, and they have received all sorts of awards for their product	neg

This software is focused on learning the rules of the game.  Movement of different pieces and pawns is demonstrated through an assortment of arcade-type games.  There are some decent books for learning chess for beginners, but learning through a computer game program makes it much easier and more fun. ---  --- The program doesn't contain any instructions,so some people may find it frustrating figuring out what to do in the beginning. However, there is a symbol in the top right corner, clicking on which brings down the menu at which point navigating becomes a piece of cake. ---  --- Just knowing the rules of the game enables one to play chess, but not exactly to win, so the second CD in this series (Learn to Play Chess 2) continues where the first one left off and goes into different tactics and strategies.   ---  --- The software is recommended for 8 year-old children and older - kids at heart may have fun learning chess with this program also	pos

I will try to keep this brief... by the way I'm only 10 hrs thru... only just got out of City #1 Rabernastre, Dalmasca and now in city #2 Bahjerba (sp?): ---  --- Quickly, my first impressions of the game were strange... I was like "MEH I dunno if I want to keep playing..." but after maybe 20 min of getting of the 'wierdness' it really sucks you in. Ughh I really wish I didn't have midterms coming up so I could go home and play! ---  --- Pros: --- - Love the battle system! It's still strategy but it doesn't require you to have random battles... ughh I'd hate the "whzzzhhh" of the starting of random battles... I can still feel in control but doing less actual work. --- - Like everyone else says, CG always good. --- - Story... though not as much character development/focus as previous ones, I do like the whole war/polity centered plot. It does follow FFT's tradition. --- - I actually like the license board... some people have said it's a pain in the beginning, but so far it hasn't been the case for me... granted I did very early in the game decide to level up Vaan a bit (~40 min or so). You really just need to know to only use the board when you really need to... don't randomly buy spots on the board just as things become available as its difficult for one person to learn EVERYTHING. Plan, plan, plan. (Right now by the way I'm constructing my chars in the way the game hints at... its only one way to do it, but first time around I'll follow it... the already licensed equipment/abilities hint at what they'll be good at.) --- - HUGE game. Lots of stuff to see... and quite beautiful. --- - Character design... course there is always someone to love... (Har har har... as a fangirl I must say I love Basch :D lol... tho I love the babyface of earlier FF characters I think Vaan is too babyfaced. He looks like a kid.--haha I'm a college student and such a fangirl... haha... sad isn't it?--If I were a guy, I'd say I'd like Fran the most... this is of course subject to personal opinion.) --- - I like subs and I like how they are not bland... they have fancy font this time :D. (Kinda reminds me of Nochnoi Dozor.) Makes the game really movie-ish. --- - Widescreen capability... (Looks SWEET on my widescreen PC monitor.) --- - Course everyone always talks about the realism of selling pelts and what not... I also like that. --- - Free-moving camera... Thank heaven for that. I LOVE it. I hated the still camera immensely in FFX. --- - Cute monsters... lol love the cactuar like monster and the rogue tomato! --- - Also love how you can avoid some boss moves by skillfully moving around them. ---  --- Cons: --- - HUGE game... (yes also a con)... lots of time running around. Good thing all the characters don't run as painstakingly slow as Tidus did in FFX. ---  --- Meh... neutral: --- - Voices - I dunno what is up with people liking the previous FF's voice actors but anyhoo I thought this time there were better ones. The prev. FF's voice actors were okay but not great. Here the voice actors are really good, but the choice of some of them seems strange... like I have a problem with Fran's voice... it was a strange choice and a strange voice. Also Balthier's voice doesn't seem to go with his look, but I really do like the voice acting by itself. (In sum, some voices, though really well acted, didn't seem to fit the actor's look... however, I do favor good actors with mismatched roles over okay actors with well-matched roles so I  give the voice acting a mild thumbs up.) After reading a review which mentioned mispronunciations, I feel I must also address that... As someone who speaks some French I did twitch when I heard "Marquis" pronounced both as "Markus" and "Marquis" rather than "Markee." I also did twitch when they pronounced "fete" as "feet" rather than "feh-t." --- - Soundtrack - I liked all the music (there was a lot) taken from FFT... esp the battle music in the Estersand, I think it is... totally taken from FFT (obviously as both take place in the same world)... I did enjoy the non-midi renditions of the themes... but the rest of the new guy's music was just 'meh'... wasn't particularly bad, but it didn't really stand out much either	pos

I have a 2 month old high-end Dell PC with tons of memory and disk, running Windows XP Pro.  This game doesn't work.  Period.  First of all, when I installed it, it reset my graphics options.

After numerous tries, and killing the program with the task manager, I finally attempted the other Activities options.  Clicking on them does absolutely nothing!

Mercifully, VH-1 hasn't released the nauseating, moron-targeting 'I Love The 90s' DVD series (yet), so you'll have to settle for a similarly appalling companion soundtrack disc. ---  --- This is precisely the kind of CD which shouldn't even exist anymore given the availability of this material on the internet, legal or illegal.  There's no rhyme or reason to the collection, and the songs you might actually want to remember...you probably already downloaded them. ---  --- The source show is easily one of the most appalling projects MTV/VH-1 has produced in some time.  It's basically a bunch of 'comedians' and third-tier celebrities talking about the 80s or 90s (or rather, the highlights of what corporate product was released in 1996, say) with such fond memories and gusto, hoping the next generation ingests this poison with the understanding that Mambo No. 5 was a 'good, memorable song' for instance. ---  --- Avoid at all costs.  Take pleasure in denying Tag Team their royalties when you find their 'classic' song on online...for free	neg

One thing you will find reading through many reviews is a dissatisfaction with the state filings. This is my own experience and this may be the last year I use TaxCut because of it. First of all, it would not allow me to e-file my state return but didn't explain why. I later discovered that for most states you apparently can't e-file a partial year return. Then when printing out the state return it told me I had to also include a form that was mentioned nowhere else in the program. I later found out that Taxcut does not support all state tax forms! I then had to get that form and fill it in manually, and then discovered I owed less than before because Taxcut had incorrectly calculated my capital gains. AND there was nothing on the missing state form that could not have been completed with data the program already had. ---  --- TaxCut also advised me I could save $1000 off my fed bill by contributing to an IRA. So I opened and IRA and contributed $4000. When I went back to TaxCut and entered the details it told me I wasn't eligible for any tax deduction. I was ready to be tied up! This software is seriously dysfunctional. ---  --- I'm guessing by this stage you get the idea. Bottom line: I will be looking elsewhere to complete my tax returns next year. ---  --- Oh, by the way, if like me you were unable to efile and you paid for the efile option, you can get a credit from H&R by calling 1-888-4TAXCUT option 2,2,0	neg

I used herbalism for a few weeks after discovering lush products through a friend. My face, esp. my forehead became very greasy, and every pore on my forehead became inflamed. I thought it was stress and continued using it until my next lush run when they gave me a sample of aquamarina. My face cleared up instantly. When the aquamarina ran out I went back to herbalism, but -surprise- the skin problems reemerged. Now, I'm using aquamarina instead and love it, though you can't get it through amazon for some reason. Check the lush website. I'm sure this won't happen to everyone, but give that pink glop a try instead	neg
This is my third heart rate monitor. I purchased this one because the battery died in my last HR watch. I thought I could replace the battery, but when I tried to replace it, I broke it. Oh well. . .  ---  --- Anyway, I purchased the Reebok Fitness HR Watch because it was on sale (50% off retail). I couldn't find any reviews on it so I "rolled the dice."  ---  --- With my two previous HR watches, it was pretty intuitive as to how to set and operate them without reading the instructions. With the Reebok HR watch, I had to read the instructions a couple of times. After a couple of training sessions, I began to feel comfortable on how to operate it and use its settings.  ---  --- There are a few PROS on the Reebok HR watch:  ---  --- (1) The chest heart rate strap will work with Precor cardio machines with heart rate monitors. ---  --- (2) The chest heart rate strap's battery is easily replaced. (I don't know about the watch.)  ---  --- (3) It has a lot of features that you'll find in higher priced HR watches.  ---  --- Now, the CONS:  ---  --- (1) The heart rate reading is much too small if you're near-sighted or need reading glasses.  ---  --- (2) The shape of the crystal cover causes a glare under certain indoor and outdoor lighting so it's difficult to read the small heart rate reading.  ---  --- In conclusion, because the heart rate reading is too small and there's a glare, I can't read the watch unless I slow down, steady my arm, and position my arm at a certain angle to deflect the glare. Because of this, I'm disappointed with this watch.  ---  --- If you've got good eyesight, you can add 1-star	neg

I was never much of a Chili Peppers fan over the years, but I thought I'd give them a chance and listen to this disc.And just as I always thought, it's crap. Very few bands have been able to pull off the repulsive people/repulsive music combo as thoroughly as these guys have. I feel like I need a bath after just looking at their picture. As far as the "music" is concerned, the singing is awful(deadpan monotone voice), the instrumentation is very limited, and the overall production is 2nd rate. The ONLY plus, if any, is that the band manages to show some progression on the newer material, which is still not very good. The fact that this band has been successful over the years just proves that a lot of people have REALLY bad taste.         	neg

Take a brief look at the lives of some Jewish Hungarians during WW2 in Auschwitz concentration camp. I don't think any of us can even begin to imagine the hell these people went through. Watching thousands of your friends, families and neighbors being gassed to death and then loading their lifeless bodies into crematoriums until the only thing left are their ashes you are covered in. It just goes beyond anything I can fathom. These people did what they had to do to survive just one more day in the hell they were thrown into. Would I make the same choices they had? Would it be worth living one more day, doing what they had to do? I don't know, and I do not think any one of us have the right to judge their decisions. I do know this movie does an excellent job of showing how is might of been for those poor souls	pos
I wanted a glass hummingbird feeder and decided to try this one on my window before springing for some of the more glamorous-looking blown glass ones. I mounted it on my kitchen window, under an awning on the northeast side of the house, not at all expecting anything to happen. A ruby-throated hummingbird found it the very first day! ---  --- It took some force at first to separate the mounting bracket thing from the feeder itself. In fact, I had to drop it first for it to break loose and detach! Fortunately, nothing broke. I probably could have just soaked it in some hot soapy water and it would have come apart easily. ---  --- You can't beat glass. I'm just totally getting away from plastic these days...	pos
Castlevania: Curse of Darkness is a game that even the die-hard Castlevania fan might not much get into. Lament of Innocence wasn't a terrible game, but it wasn't great. And Curse of Darkness just goes to show that when a 3D Castlevania game marches forth, it has problems. Sometimes scary problems. Like Lament of Innocence, it had so much potential to be good--this title more so. But it doesn't deliver, and that's a sad revelation to admit to, especially after having so much enjoyment with the DS smash: Dawn of Sorrow. ---  --- Ever since the 1997 all time best, Symphony of the Night, so many main characters in the series have to be like Alucard in SOME way. Hector in Curse of Darkness is no exception. He looks a little like Alucard. ---  --- But we're not here to discuss that. Hector is a Devil Forgemaster, one who has given up his powers. Dracula is dead, but the land is overun with the curse of monsters on the world of Valachia. Hector, however, isn't concerned about what kind of shape the world is in. He's more concerned about an evil Devil Forgemaster by the name of Issac, who has killed his beloved. If you couldn't guess, it's time for revenge. And so Issac leads Hector into a place full of traps and obstacles he must overcome. And by doing so, Hector will slowly recover his Devil Forgemaster skills and whatnot. The story actually unfolds with excellent voice-acting, but there isn't much story. ---  --- Since Symphony of the Night we've been given this Metroid style exploration when it comes to Castlevania. This is marvelous, and once again, makes its way into the 3D world of Castlevania. You explore a large castle riddled with goodies. This includes weapons, subweapons, armor and much more. ---  --- Playing the game can be quite fun. Most of the game, as you might have guessed, is spent running through endless hallways of defeating monsters. That isn't as boring as you might think. You can perform some cool looking combos on enemies, but each one must be finished with the B button. You can also lock onto enemies and perform combos. This makes the camera go crazy, though, but this is forgiveable. Battling without locking on is actually much better, and it isn't too hard to do without. Although, if you want to steal from your enemies, you'll have to lcok on to 'em. Speaking of stealing, it's nice that you can actually do that. Many a time a monster will leave himself open for stealing. This usually occurs while it recovers from taking damage. Again, you must be locked on for it to happen. ---  --- Likewise, unlike Lament of Innocence, they actually use the level up system. In other words, there's actually a point to battling through hordes of monsters this time. ---  --- You also have little helper monsters. You can compare them to the familiars found in other Castlevania games (like Symphony of the Night and Dawn of Sorror), but the better comparison would be Pokemon. They lend their assistance and gain experience from defeating enemies, just as you do. It's nice not to have to go at it alone, but we Castlevania veterans would prefer to go at it alone. Each enemy also drops evolution crystals. Collect enough of them and your monster will evolve. You won't grow to like them, though. That's the sad part, and they don't really enhance the gameplay. The monsters have special abilities, though. Golem like creatures can open heavy doors, imps let you bury underground. But you can't help but admit it would be nice if your little innocent devils were actually characters. Also, no evolution crystal is the same. You can take advantage of the system by collecting different types of crystals and seeing how your little buddies evolve. ---  --- One of the nice things about being a devil forger, you can make your own weapons! And Hector can do it at any time he wants! That's right, no running back to some stupid shop to do it! Monsters often drop raw materials, and you can use them to make new weapons or make your current weapons stronger. You can do this simply by opening the menu. I don't know about you, but that's pretty satisfying to me to be able to do that. ---  --- The weapons have their own little downside however. With the exception of the sword, none of them are highly helpful in combat. You start the game off with a short sword, and you'll grow accustomed to its fast speed and easy use. Other weapons just aren't fast enough, and enemies aren't weak to a certain weapon "type". This makes the weapon crafting system a little useless at some points. Unless you're a person who likes to use "cool" looking weapons as opposed to swift and powerful weapons, you won't have THAT much use for the weapon crafting system, except to power up your sword. Thus, experimenting with weapons garners no fun. ---  --- It is pretty cool, I must say, to be venturing somewhere that isn't Dracula's castle. Instead you actually venture through the world of Valachia. Meaning you'll trek through swamps, mountains, valleys and a lot more. So if you're tired of Dracula's castle, this is quite a change. ---  --- The problem with this "world" is that you don't see enough of it. There's not enough detail to it. You have to follow a beaten path (so it isn't really that different than Dracula's castle in Lament of Innocence), so you can't go off and just explore the places you're at. The game also suffers from what Lament of Innocence suffered from: the lack of detailed enviroments. You'll no doubt run down the same path/hall/corridor several times over. If it weren't for the map you'd find yourself lost, thinking you must be in one of those "looping" ares, or that you took a wrong turn and ended up running in a circle. ---  --- The monsters are also not so great. What I love about the 2D Castlevania games (especially in the new Dawn of Sorrow) is how much variety is thrown into the monsters. The attacks they use on you. Even if they're the same looking monster, they throw in some new attack that you don't expect. Curse of Darkness (like Lament of Innocence) has no variety. You'll run into the same batch of monsters constantly, and they'll never do something new. Later in the game you'll find yourself fighting nothing but reincarnates of different colored monsters that do nothing new. Likewise, all the monsters you'll ever see are encountered pretty early on. The moment you run into an Axe Armor, you've run into 'em all! They'll never change. ---  --- I sound like I'm being picky about the enemies thing, but I'm not. It takes away from the challenge of the game. The fact that reincarnates don't do anything new makes it more true. And that's not the worst part: the game overall just isn't a challenge. The bosses can be, at times, but if you've been playing 3D action games, I think you'll find even the more challenging bosses to be no challenge at all. The early boss battles in the game are fairly easy. Later on, however, they get start to get hard, and that's when battling them actually becomes fun. Again, though, if you're an action/adventure pro, you'll probably beat most of them on your first try. ---  --- I wish I could say the graphics are great. Hey, Hector looks great in combat. But the enviroments don't have enough detail. Too many of them are simple everyday enviroments we've been seeing for a long time now. Where's the detail? You know... like... maybe the leaves on a tree moving? We're at that point where there could be some kind of interation with the enviroment, instead of it seeming like we're running through a still-life painting. Visually, it doesn't look half bad. It's just that there could be so much more. The bosses look cool, and the framerate doesn't slow down at all, but there isn't enough variety, or detail. ---  --- However, I must say this: the music sounds AWESEOME! As usual, the Castlevania games have some of the best music there is to be heard in gaming! Is it better than Symphony of the Night? No, it's not. It isn't better than Lament of Innocence either (which also had steller music), but it is still among the best you'll ever hear in a video game. Likewise, the voice acting is actually really really GOOD! I just wish I could've heard more of it! ---  --- Curse of Darkness had the potential to be a good game. But there are a lot of things that keep it down. It's a fairly fun game to play, but it lacks innovation. You won't be able to separate it from the other action/adventure 3D games. It's got nothing that makes it stick out. ---  --- If you MUST have this game, however, I'd say wait for a price drop. If you're really looking for a good Castlevania game, I'd suggest getting a hold of "Dawn of Sorrow". It's a much better game. ---  --- The Good: --- +Great Music! Some of the best in gaming! --- +Good weapon system --- +It's pretty fun to play --- +You can steal from enemies! --- +Great Voice acting! ---  --- The Bad --- -Little innovation --- -Lack of cutscenes to advance the story --- -Too much of the game gets recycled too fast --- -Too easy --- -The game doesn't look bad, but there's little imagination in the environments --- -Not a whole lot of different enemies --- -It's too easy --- -Boring level designs (not enough of them) --- -You just can't help that the game has almost no innovation! It's no different than your average action/adventure 3D game ---  --- Get Dawn of Sorrow, or one of the other 2D versions of the game. They seem to fare so much better than this one does. Even the die-hard fan of Castlevania has to admit this one is rather bland	pos

The flight into New York had been a long one; but I was gently revived when Kirsten Dunst met me at the airport.  She was to be my escort that night at the Lincoln Center where the President would present me the Distinguished Writer's Cross-the highest award this nation can bestow on an author.  I quickly slipped my only suitcase in the backseat and sat next to her as she drove her Mercedes S class sedan to the Waldorf Astoria downtown. ---  --- "I have to admit that I didn't you who you were until I read STARLESS GRASSLANDS.  I don't mean to embarrass you; but that book changed my life." ---  --- I tried to be polite and gracious toward the compliment.  For the remainder of the trip we had a nice conversation while I approved the fluid motion of her hands and legs as she maneuvered the controls of the automobile.  I very much approved of her legs. ---  --- As I departed the car, Kirsten leaned toward the open door to catch my eyes. ---  --- "Don't forget.  I'll be by at seven so we can go to the ceremony together.  Please be ready." ---  --- I expressed gratitude for her generosity and promised to be waiting for her seven sharp.  The hotel staff greeted me and soon I entered the elevator for a quiet ride to the eighty sixth floor.  As I entered the suite, the steward took my request to have my suit blushed, prepared and returned in a few hours. ---  --- Finally, a bit of peace.  I poured a small measure of whiskey into a chilled tumbler and then walked over to the large window looking out over the city below.  For a few moments I contemplated the remarks I was to make at this evening's formal ceremonies, then I heard the hushed movement of stocking feet behind me across the room.   ---  --- I turned around and out of the bedroom to my left in walked Sandy Bullock dressed in a black sheer see through cat suit. ---  --- "Well, Crabby, aren't you glad to see me?" ---  --- Before I could recover from my surprise another set of feet wisped across the floor from the sitting room on the right.  It was Jennifer Aniston dressed in the same black sheet cat suit. ---  --- "Sweetheart, don't look at her.  Come here to me." ---  --- "Get out!" screamed Sandy.   ---  --- "No, you get out.  It's not fair.  I left Brad for him so I get him!" ---  --- The two of them stood in angry silence staring at each other for a tense moment.  Then Sandy leapt at Jennifer and instantly they were in a bitter fight hissing and scratching each other.  It was a ferocious sight as pulled hair, shrieks of pain, and nylon tearing could be heard.  Then almost a quickly as it began, the fighting pair disappeared into the sitting room.  Several sharp punches were heard then a definite thump as a body fell to the floor.   ---  --- Sandy marched back into the room victorious.  I ran to the door of the sitting room only to see Jennifer laid out on the floor out cold, spread eagle and naked.  Before I could think of what to do Sandy tapped me on my shoulder.  I turned around and there Sandy stood.  A little worse for wear.  Trying to catch her breath.  Nude with her torn cat suit draped across her feet. ---  --- "Forget her.  She won't bother us now." ---  --- Sandy brushed the stray hairs out of her face, smiled and stepped out of her nylon costume.  She posed standing and anticipating my admiration.   ---  --- "Now I'm all sweaty and warm.  I need a shower."  Sandy turned her lithe body and walked into the bedroom and into the bathroom beyond. ---  --- I turned around and wondered what I should do for poor Jennifer still laying unconscious on the floor.  Then I heard Sandy calling. ---  --- "Crabby, why don't you come and help me?  You could soap up my......" ---  ---  --- OOPS!!!!  Sorry!!!  Err...just a little fantasy of mine.  I meant to honestly review this movie but my more realistic nature took over.  I swear my pitiful fantasy is actually much better than the story told here.  You see, the cover of this DVD displays Ms. Bullock prominently with her name in big font letters.  But in truth this movie focuses on Tate Donovan as the main character and only on Ms. Bullock as his unlikely love interest. ---  --- As much as I "love" Sandra Bullock, I have to admit her filmography has not been kind to her.  Her best films have been WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING, WRESTLING ERNEST HEMINGWAY and the much-unappreciated HOPE FLOATS.  Unfortunately for each of these gems are several terrible movies like FIRE ON THE AMAZON, HANGMAN, SPEED 2 and this movie. ---  --- The plot revolves around two "losers in love" who are unappealing both in looks and personality.  Donovan comes across a love potion from a gypsy woman (an unrecognizable Anne Bancroft) and soon both Donovan and Bullock have the most desirable members of the opposite sex at their feet.  All goes well until others find out their secret and Donovan and Bullock discover that their true love is actually between each other. ---  --- The story is predictable and unfortunately not very funny or all that sweet.  Chances are you can find a copy of this DVD fairly cheap and it is not a bad way to kill some time while you're waiting for your own boyfriend or girlfriend to get off work-or your friends to wake up from their naps-so you can really do something worth wild.	neg
Not knowing fully what I was getting into, on a whim I purchased this monopod hoping that is was a half-way decent product, I mean-it was so cheap.  I was pleasantly surprised to find how sturdy the unit was and that what I had was a very high quality monopod.  This was my second monopod and so I had another to compare it with (the other was bought on an auction website).  In comparison the Opteka was a far better monopod in height and robust thickness and I use it exclusively on my miniDV shoots	pos
This movie is a wonderful follow up to the first...Anne has the same charming spirit and the cast is just as wonderful as they were the first time. I highly recommend this movie to anyone	pos
I just recently bought the Blackberry Pearl and I love the device. Its stylish, beautiful, small, and it has some awsome features. However, since i bought it from Amazon, Cingular took forever just to approve me and give me a new number. So I constantly had to call amazon and ask them about my order. Then I receive the phone almost a week later than the day I placed my order and as I follow the instructions my phone didn't want to work. So the representatives told me there was something wrong with my SIM card... when it wasn't. Luckily I called Cingular and a very HELPFUL representative helped me set up my account and ACTUALLY the service when Amazon told me there was something wrong with my SIM card LOL. Overall, Amazon should be more careful how they describe their phone activation process because it wasn't easy. But whatever I love shopping @ Amazon and I truly love my phone and I bet you will love it too. :)!!	pos
THE battery is good after a full charge.  It lacks in holding the promised charge.  I find after 2 weeks it is questionable, depending on how many pictures were taken before the camera sat waiting to be used again. I got over 100 pictures when used in 3 days, Which is more that my AA nimh 2100mah. Which I bought from Walmart {so probably not a super battery}  The wallmart batteries actually hold the charge longer {very sad}.The charge time is not to long when charger from half charge. --- Over all, I hope the next ones I buy will be better than these.  My solution is to carry a non rechargeable battery in my case for when the Delkin dies.  I also try to give it a full charge before leaving the house, as there is no memory effect.  I also recomend checking to see if there is a firmware upgrade for your camera.  Every camera shuts off when the battery is at a different power level.  My Nikon coolpix 3100, seems to shut down sooner than later.  All reviews should mention what camera they are using for this reason.  Have been using 3 months now.	neg

I have been using Cindy Crawfords tapes since 1993. I used shape your body while I was pregnant 10 years ago ( Don't be horrified )  living in the tropics and with a few adjustments I did that workout in the pool minus the situps combined with walking. I had my first birth naturally and within 3 Hours and had the best legs ever. ---  --- My first impression of Cindy was that she is honest. She does not pretend to be the expert and she really has a Genunie interest in exercising this shines throught on the DVDs.  I have tried many other celebrity videos and you just don't feel comfortable with them. She does not try to exercise and be perfect at the same time. Really  she is there just to help and with alot of sympathy.You cannot help but like her. ---  --- New Dimension is fantastic I have started doing the 10min workout everyday. You do not have to do alot to get results just target the right areas. People can workout for an hour and not get the same results. --- New Dimension is not just a post pregnancy DVD . This is great for women over 35 that want to control their pelvic muscles the other two workouts on the DVD are more than you will ever need to work all your body . I still mix it up with first two DVDs --- I have just purchased the set of three DVds again to replace worn out copies . Cindy looks like she will be in my lounge room for a very long time. --- Please enjoy !!!!!!	pos
The phrase "more efficient sourcing" means that Lands End is now buying these in China.

Have used this lens from the deer stand while hunting, at sporting events (indoor and outdoor) and at concerts.  Fast focusing and great image stabilization (IS does use quite a bit more power, though).  Have not had one problem with it. Solid build and has a little heft to it.  It is a bit pricey, but I chaulk that up to it being about the best on the market.  Would recommend it to anyone looking for a top shelf lens.	pos

Jack London needs to be given his proper due. He is a tremendously talented writer and his understanding of life matches his tremendous knowledge of the snow-enshrouded world of the upper latitudes. Although The Call of the Wild is a short novel and on the surface a dog's story, it contains as much truth and reality of man's own struggles as that which can be sifted from the life's work of many other respected authors.  ---  --- Jack London's writing is beautiful, poignant, and powerful, yet also somber, morose, and infinitely real. London doesn't paint pretty picture, nor is the story elevating or uplifting. As an animal lover, I found parts of this story heartbreaking from Buck's removal from the civilized Southland in which he reigned supreme among his animal kin to the brutal cold and even more brutal machinations of hard, weathered men who literally beat him and whipped him full of lashes.  ---  --- Even sadder are the stories of the dogs that fill the sled's traces around him. Good-spirited Curly never had a chance, while Dave's story is only made bearable because of his brave, undying spirit. Even Spitz, the harsh taskmaster, has to be pitied, despite his harsh nature, for the reader knows this harsh nature was forced upon him by man and his thirst for riches. Buck's travails are long and hard, but it is his nobility of his spirit that makes of him a hero, despite the primitive animal instincts and urges that dominate him. Buck not only conquers the weather, the harshness of the men, the other dogs and the wolves he comes into contact with, he thrives.  ---  --- Hopes for redemption with John Thornton are dashed in the end, and that's when Buck finally gives in fully to "the call of the wild," becoming a creature of nature only. While this is a sad ending, the reader also feels joy and satisfaction at Buck's refusal to surrender and his ability to find his own kind of happiness in the harsh world in which he is placed	pos

This unforgettable story illustrates the crazy, life-changing adventure of a seventeen-year-old boy who struggles to let go of his fading childhood and accept the phoniness of the adult world. Holden Caulfield's loneliness and lack of motivation combined with a traumatic childhood cause him to leave behind his youthful days at Pencey Prep to venture into the dynamic adult world of New York City. Holden tries to hide his youthful innocence as he mirrors the habits of other adults, going to bars, drinking, and purchasing prostitutes. However, his bickering and sarcastic attitude suggest a hidden desire to stay young, a desire he stubbornly buries beneath his new, mature lifestyle. Holden, like many others, longs to live in a place that is simple and motionless, a place where one needn't worry about the past or the future. Holden also hopes to preserve the innocence in others, such as his sister, so they don't turn out like him, depressed and regretful. Through Salinger's vibrant attitude towards Holden's experience in New York, we readers learn to stop running from our past to prevent losing our youth altogether. The Catcher in the Rye has survived generations as one of the world's best bildungsromans, not because it illustrates the fading youth and growing maturity of a memorable character, but because it demonstrates the confusion of a character as he fights desperately to protect what remains of his childhood	pos
The satin finish and the design are very attractive.  I had to pump each chamber about 100 times to get it primed but after that it worked great.  You might want to prime it with water instead of shampoo to get things going.  The directions, which I lost, said something about priming. ---  --- Installation was easy.  It includes both glue or 4 short adhesive strips.  I went with the adhesive strips and it seems secure.  I figured if I ever have to remove it, I could just pull it off and use Goof Off to remove the adhesive. ---  --- If you fill one of the chambers with body soap, I recommend Neutrogena Rainbath Refreshing Shower and Bath Gel, Original Formula and a natural sponge.  I bought a synthetic sponge that looks like a natural one at Wal-Mart and it's a little rough	pos
I knew that this concert DVD was an acoustic show so I wasn't surprised that the tempo was slow at the beginning. But to start the show with Gilmour tuning his guitar was a bit much.  ---  --- Once he did start playing, Gilmour was having such a hard time finding his rhythm that I found myself praying for the drums to kick in.  ---  --- By the time things settle down, the really glaring problem with this DVD comes to the surface. The mix is horrible. The crowd noise drowns out Gilmour at times when they cheer a song they recognize, he is almost inaudible when talking between songs and at many points the backup singers completely cancel him out. I found myself constantly adjusting the volume which really takes away from the "concert experience". ---  --- There are high points in the show, but the low points are rock bottom. Comfortably Numb is a song that millions of people know by heart. Two versions are provided on this DVD - from the concert and in the bonus section. Neither of the guest singers (Robert Hewitt and Sir Bob Geldoff) know the words, have to read from sheet music and based on their phrasing have never heard the song before. Gilmour would have been better off asking for a volunteer from the audience.  ---  --- The very best thing on this DVD is, oddly enough, in the bonus section. Screamin' Jay Hawkins' I Put a Spell on You, a blues standard performed with Mica Paris and Jools Holland, almost makes the DVD worth buying. Almost.  ---  --- Watch Jonathan Demme's beautiful treatment of Neil Young: Heart of Gold if you really want to see a great acoustic show. That is the gold standard.	neg
This philosophy kit really works for people with consistant light to moderate acne. I've tried just about everything out there-prescription topicals & pills, Pro-activ, and all the over the counter stuff. I have adult acne, I never experienced acne as a teenager. When I first started using Philosophy's kit I didn't notice a huge change in the first few weeks, beyond pimples clearing up faster. Around week 5 or 6, I began to notice that I wasn't waking up to a new zit every morning and I didn't feel oily at the end of the day. Now, I have been using for 4 months and feel like a new person. I don't have to cover my face with concealer or retouch make-up throughout the day. I can walk out the door with just powder on my face for the first time in years! I would recommend this kit to anyone who can't use benzoyl peroxide and is frustrated with all the other products on the market	pos
After playing Grand Theft Auto III, I thought there was no way Rockstar could top themselves.  In fact, when the advance word for this game got out, I actually thought this was nothing more than an ADD-ON for GTA3.  Stupid thought, I know; on the whole, GTA:VC is bigger, badder, and more audacious than GTA3 ever was. ---  --- So, here's the story: ---  --- In 1986, Tommy Vercetti -- a hitter for the Forelli crime family in Liberty City -- is finally released from prison.  Sonny Forelli, his boss, immediately sends him down to Vice City to close a major drug deal being handled by Ken Rosenberg, a shyster lawyer and the Forellis' contact.  No sooner is the deal closed than gunmen break it all up, kill everyone but Tommy and Ken, and take both the drugs and the cash.  Now, Tommy has to recover the money for Sonny...but before long, he decides to make a name for himself in this town.   ---  --- The setting is pure '80s excess, through and through.  If you take the bottomless amoral corruption of Scarface, the day-glo polyester fashion of Miami Vice, and the innate cheesy greed of Ronald Reagan's 1980s American culture, you'll have Vice City.  You'll see it in the fashion sense of the citizens, the local architecture, and the cars tooling around on the road.  You'll even hear it in the radio stations, which boast an array of heavy metal, dance, Latino, and bubblegum pop music the like of which you haven't even thought of since the '80s.  I swear; try listening to one of the radio stations and see if the memories don't come flooding back.   ---  --- The voice acting is, as usual, superb.  Ray Liotta did an outstanding job bringing Tommy Vercetti to life, and in making an otherwise loathsome sociopath into a strangely likable character.  And there are others as well; Burt Reynolds, Dennis Hopper, Gary Busey, Lee Majors, Fairuza Balk, and Robert Davi all turn in great performances.  But Philip Michael Thomas, who played Don Johnson's partner Tubbs on Miami Vice, gets special mention; in more ways than one, his character -- Lance Vance -- is the one to keep an eye on. ---  --- While the main story missions only take up a third of the game itself, it's the addition of a new feature that not only rounds things out, it also adds length to the game, and really makes you feel like you're establishing a criminal empire.  They're called asset properties.  At a certain point in the game, you have the option of buying certain businesses.  Once you buy one of these asset properties, and you complete its mission strand, that business will start generating a daily amount of money for you to pick up.  Some of them are perfectly legitimate, such as the taxi company or the nightclub.  Others are a little sketchy, like the boatyard or the strip club, but others are absolutely illegal, like the protection rackets, the "ice cream" company, or the car showroom.  They add a great amount of depth, and they let you establish contacts across town.  Needless to say, once Sonny Forelli comes to town to "check up" on you, make no mistake...he's now in YOUR town. ---  --- So, if you feel the need to get away from it all and indulge your inner Tony Montana, book a trip to Vice City.  Like San Andreas, it's a great place to visit and unwind...and also like San Andreas, you'll be glad YOU don't live there	pos
I've had an old Weber for 15 years - still works well! However, as it was getting too small for my growing needs and starting to show its age, I "upgraded" to this model. --- The new one has more bells and whistles - I do love the smoking burner/box combo. The rest of the features are nice too. However, this thing is almost impossible to get to 500 degrees to sear a steak or do some other high-temp cooking! It runs through a tank of propane in just a couple of serious days of cooking and once you're at less than 3/4 tank, don't bother with high heat - it's not there!  --- On the other hand - very few flare-ups and mid/low temp cooking is great	neg

This is one of the best-tasting energy/snack bars I've tried.  It has true flavors (think a chewy chocolate brownie with small chocolate chips), little or no "off" flavors or aftertastes, and it's relatively filling, especially if accompanied by water or an additional quick snack, such as fruit.  It's a small bar, but it's packed with 3 grams of fiber (12% of daily needs based on a 2,000 calorie diet), and it's certified 95% organic.  These organic ingredients include organic rolled oats, organic oat Flour, organic oat fiber, organic and milled flaxseed, and actual natural flavors.  Even the sweet stuff is organic:, including organic chocolate (made with--you guessed it--organic evaporated cane juice), soy butter, cocoa powder, cocoa butter, tapioca syrup, and fig paste. CLIF's website proclaims that  "CLIF ZBar is the first kids' snack created to comply with SB-19, California's Senate Bill limiting fat and sugar in foods offered within the state's school system...We source ingredients which do not contain wheat and are not genetically engineered."  Although aimed at kids, adults and teens will enjoy this as well.   ---  --- Ingredients: Organic Rolled Oats, Organic Chocolate Chips (Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Organic Unsweetened Chocolate, Organic Cocoa Butter, Soy Lecithin, Natural Flavors), Organic Evaporated Cane Juice Syrup, Organic Brown Rice Syrup, Organic Tapioca Syrup, Organic Fig Paste, Organic Oat Flour, Organic Cocoa Powder, Organic Soy Butter, Natural Flavors, Organic Oat Fiber, Organic Milled Flaxseed, Organic Chocolate (Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Organic Unsweetened Chocolate, Organic Cocoa Butter, Soy Lecithin), Salt, Baking Soda. For those with allegies, CLIF includes the following caution "Contains soy. May contain traces of milk, peanuts and other nuts." ---  --- Vitamins & Minerals: Calcium Carbonate, Ascorbic Acid (Vit. C), Niacinamide (Vit. B3), Ferric Orthophosphate (Iron), Zinc Oxide, Cyanocobalamin (Vit. B12), Thiamine Mononitrate (Vit. B1), Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (Vit. B6), Riboflavin (Vit. B2), Folic Acid (Vit. B9), Beta Carotene (Vit A). ---  --- Nutritional Information: In one bar (36 grams) there are 120 calories, 3 grams of fat (5% of percent daily values based on a 2,000 calorie diet), of which one gram s saturated fat(but no trans fat), 0 cholesterol, 12 grams sugar, A total of 22 grams carbohydrates (7%), which includes 12 grams of sugar and 10 grams of other carbohydrates, 125 mg of sodium (4%), 110 mg. potassium(3%), 3 grams of dietary fiber (12%) and a gram of insoluble fiber, and the following vitamins and minerals:  Vitamin A (6%), B1(30%), B2 (15%), B3 (20%), B6 (20%), B12 (10%), %).

Man!  What's the f#$%ing deal with companies handing over their biggest game franchises to second and third party developers???  Haven't they ever heard the old saying, "Dance with the one that brought you???" ---  --- This game is horrible, and if you say otherwise you're in bad need of therapy because you're so desperate for a video game that you've convinced yourself this is worthy of your time. ---  --- Or maybe your time is truly that worthless...in which case you should contemplate drastic measures. ---  --- First off, the game is VERY linear.  "Call of Duty 2" truly felt like an open battlefield, whereas this one feels like a ride at Disneyland.  Sure the scenery is beefed up and beautiful, but how about those character animations?  The mouths aren't synched to the dialogue, and they do that mindless hand-waving thing when they talk...just like all cinematics did back on the PS1 and N64.   ---  --- The AI is horrible.  In Call of Duty 2 you couldn't just hold your crosshairs in the same spot and wait for the idiot German to pop up in the same place so you could plug him.  In this one you CAN---but you just don't care to.   ---  --- Also---"IT'S GLITCHERIFFIC!"  I shot a German and he flew straight up into the air, completely off the top of the screen!  I snuck up behind another German and hit him with a melee attack----the friggin' dude did two front flips and flew like twenty yards.  Mind you, he was in the standing position the entire time.  Not unlike tossing an action figure across the yard. ---  --- This game left a stale taste in my mouth, and really just pissed me off.  Call of Duty 2 was 360's only killer app.  If nothing else these people need to realize that once you have a great game---all we really want as gamers is a great big expansion pack!  They could've added 12 more hours of additional content to Call of Duty 2's campaign missions and I would've paid $60, cash on the barrelhead son.   ---  --- Way to go jacka@@es. ..	neg

I was very excited about this product, given the good reviews. However, I found that refilling the pencil took so much force that I was afraid I'd break it. Even worse, the eraser is useless, due both to the design and the material. If I could find a replacement eraser that was taller & better, this would be a much better product. If I have to carry this plus a separate eraser, it's not really saving me much. ---  --- Oh, and the highlighter isn't a marker. Maybe I'm stupid, but I assumed it would be. It's just an orange ink pen, which is not the same as any other highlighter I'd choose to use	neg
Being an Oriental I am fairly familiar with films released by our geographical neighbours, although not as extensive as standard Hollywood productions. With Japanese films, whether it was made by a Kurusawa or a  more obscure artisan, I can fairly adjudged them on a whole as lethargic in  pace, inconspicuously lacks background music/instrumentals, and are  generally pressed on celluluid films that are simply comparatively  substandard.  Village of Dreams, while touted as an award winner  is a  glaring testimony of this stunted Japanese film-making characteristic.  Review it yourself. The pace alone wantingly needs tighter editing. It was  the same character that can be seen even in Kurusawa's Ran - a "highly  acclaimed" work that in my case, I couldn't even view for the third  time, because even its DVD resolution has a quality that can only be  likened to the eye-view of a person who's suffering his earliest stage of  creeping glaucoma.  Village of Dreams is so "relaxed" as if the  filmmaker expects people like me to have an available time that they  enjoyed in 1940s Japan in an obscure countryside. At the very least, the  straight narrative of this film is a consolation, but with RAN, the actions  were so hard to follow, you'd be puzzled who was fighting and attacking  whom.  The most unforgivable quality of this DVD transfer  is the poor film  stock. The picture approximates that of a "third generation"  recording of a VHS copy. This means that you'll be sorely dissapointed of  having to get a VHS-quality copy COPIED, in turn, from another VHS copy  which was copied from the original VHS "master tape".  Of course,  the DVD transfer is not at fault, its simply that the Japanese despite  their touted techno prowess just couldn't give us a decent film stock, that  could at least preserve their comparatively well-made gems. The glaring  deficiency of films like this comes even more obvious, when shown on high  resolution TVs. I've viewed this film in a 29-inch Sony Wega Flat TV, and  in a 50-inch Mitsubishi projection TV, from a Pioneer DVL 919 and 909. If  not for the antics of the two children leads, Village comes off as  wearisome. I bought this film despite its hefty price tag mainly because  I'm a film collector. Its works like this that whets my appreciation for  world cinema. Unfortunately, Village's poor resolution takes away  gratifying cinematic enjoyment, as well  as negating its  "collectability" factor. This should have looked more glorious if  it could approximate the celluluid quality of examples like  What Dreams  May Come or Dark City, but of course that's asking too much from those  editing-challenged Japanese filmakers.  I want to ask Amazon for a refund  because this is not well worth its price value. I was compulsed to buy it  because of its cover, I thought it was at least as exotically  glorious-looking as KUNDUN, but it proved to be just a small, obscure  production. Critics may raved about it, just like those Canadians did with  BLACK ROBE, but the final word is that they're just run of the mill, albeit  thoughtful, films....	neg
I ordered and paid in full (through Amazon) for a gift subscription to Vogue Kitting last Christmas, 2005. The recipient never received a single issue and was treated very poorly when she phoned to inquire on more than on occasion.  ---  --- It is a quarterly publication but no longer seems to be consistently offered on news stands in major bookstores. Read the policy regarding refunds and cancellations carefully before you give them your money! ---  --- The content of the magazine may be worthwhile but their inability to deliver as promised and poor customer service earn them one star	neg

We have the 49MHz Whisper Connect and love it (see our review of that one). We needed a second monitor to replace a 900MHz Fisher Price monitor that is 4+ years old, and decided to try this one out. We set the base across the room from our daughter and had her talk at her normal voice, and we could barely hear here with the volume turned up. We thought we must have a defective unit, so we returned it and got another, and we had the same problem. There is no interference or static with the monitor - but also no sound. We're very unhappy with it and would not recommend it	neg
Upon receiving this planter, I was quite surprised at the quality of it for the bargain price.

Our son got these blocks when he was 2 months old.  My husband enjoyed them more at first, but by the time our son was 5 months old he loved playing with these!  He probably couldn't hold on to them well until he was 5 months old, so that is why he enjoyed them more at this age than earlier. ---  --- At 10 months, he still enjoys playing with them.  They have lasted through "both" children.  I would highly recommend these blocks for infants, and so far even into the toddler age, he enjoys playing with them	pos

This product is great. Its much easier to get in Canada that's why I ordered it online since I am now living in the US.  However after the fact - I did find it available at Cost Plus World Market.  Next time I will pay attention to the volume of the product. The picture is not the right one. This Double size is really waay to much for my use.

I couldn't agree more about this product. It's appalling how badly made it is. The concept is very cute - a toolbox that unfolds into bridges and roads for the small die-cast vehicles. My 2.5 year-old has a hard enough time dealing with frustration without this toy adding to it! The bridge on the right doesn't properly attach or stay up and the road pieces do not attach properly. It's also a battle to get the tool box to connect together. My son always wants to play with it, but I can't cope with his cries of frustration when it all falls apart. I think this toy will have to mysteriously "disappear" one night while he is sleeping. They should withdraw this rubbish from the market and refund us all our money!	neg

This accessory system does not fit my Kohlcraft umbrella stroller.  I can find a place to put the parent cupholder, but there is no place at all to put the child's snack tray.  The stroller will not close when it is attached anywhere on the stroller.  The whole purpose of spending the money on this "system"  (which was considerably more expensive than others in the store) was for my child to have a snack tray.  Therefore, it's going back to the store.  There are plenty of other cup accessories out there that are far cheaper than this... even the Prince Lionheart cupholder alone was very expensive...  ---  --- The product itself is also very cheaply made.  The "s" hooks look so flimsy I wouldn't trust them... again, they sell thicker, sturdier "s" hooks that look like they will work much better than this, so that's what I'll purchase.  Plus, the parent cupholder is also extremely flimsy... already the "arms" have fallen off several times and that was just moving it from the table to the kitchen counter!     ---  --- Thirdly, I'm not sure if it was the "clips" that came in my packet (perhaps a defect) or if they are all made this way... but it is extremely difficult to get the screws into the clips... and then they didn't fasten correctly.  No matter how I tried (I worked on it for close to an hour and I consider myself pretty good at these things!), I could not get the clips to tighten properly.  They continued to be loose... even with using the smaller screws.  Perhaps my stroller tubing is "too small"??? Very unlikely, but it just might be the case.   ---  --- This is going back to the store, where I will purchase the insulated parent cupholder for $5, a package of two (thick) "s" hooks for $3 and my child will have to learn to "deal" with holding her snack cup and straw cup.  I will save myself $10, a headache and backache from attempting to continue to get this on correctly, and my child will get the added bonus of learning to be responsible for her own items!!!  Do yourself a favor and don't bother with this product!!!	neg
Movie got 2/3 through and just quit. No problem, this is Windows right? Just reboot and start where you left off. Only for whatever reason I can't restart this movie from anywhere but the beginning.

I must agree with some other reviewers of this book, and say that it is a very dry list of factual data, interspersed with Bill Wyman's moans and boasts. His gripe with Allan Klein about money seems to be quite valid, but he mentions it about a thousand times. Mick and Keith get quite a pasting- again it seems quite valid, but do we need to hear it so many times?    Bill opines that Keith Richard's voice is weak and that his own songs were ignored by the band. Listen to his only self-penned Stones track of the 60s, on "Satanic Majesties", and you will conclude that this is quite a self delusion- his voice is far weaker, and his songwriting at that time was also inferior.     The book seems to be more authoritative on dates, but we can only take Bill's accuracy on faith. My knowledge of the Stones is not enormous, but even I can see some big factual errors. For example he tells us that neither Taj Mahal nor Marianne Faithfull recorded songs for the "Rock n Roll Circus". A recent re-issue has proved him completely wrong.      As another reviewer rightly said, Marianne Faithfull's autobiog is a much better read	neg

This is one of the great biopic films ever made.  More often than not, film biopics are too rushed.  They try and squeeze in every aspect of their subjects lives, and they end up giving short shrift to the person and their lives.  This is not one of those films.  It just covers Woody Guthrie's adult life, from when he hit the road to when he became a big time folk singer, and his passionate defense of the working man.  The look of the film is deliberate, in that it's washed out.  The hoedown scenes at the camp are some of the best in the film.  They're really lively, where the extras and everyone seem to be really enjoying themselves.  The film has a real genuine feel to it, like you're actually watching real people.  David Carradine is amazing as Woody Guthrie.  He makes you think you're actually watching Woody himself.  He did his own singing and stuntwork on the film.  Ronny Cox is excellent as well, and he does his own singing too (remember, Cox played the man who jammed with the hillbilly in Deliverance).  Randy Quaid and Melinda Dillon offer great supporting roles as well.  This is a fabulous film, and it feels short at 2 1/2 hours.      	pos
I got this video thinking it would be like the baby faith videos with fun and creative elements for learning development. My baby watched about two mintues and was gone. I think this is pitched as a baby video but it's really more geared toward older children. None of the elements have anything to do with the music, making is virtually useless as a learning development product. I give it a big "thumbs down". Try any one of the baby faith products like God Made Me, God Made Music and God Made Animals. They're awesome!	neg

The only misstep so far in a wonderful series.  I was so eager for the book, I got a copy of the British edition, before it got to the US.  But I was disappointed.

Yes, Ben Witherington is a (relative) conservative, but don't hold that against him. Yes, he has strong opinions, but don't hold that against him, either, because they are well argued. The fact remains that this is the best overview of "Third Quest" Jesus scholarship I have been able to find. Admirers of the Jesus Seminar may not appreciate his critique, but it is very fair and well-thought out. One of the benefits from a book like this, besides giving interested parties a launching pad for further research, is that the different views of Jesus can help one achieve a well-rounded portrait of the Savior. No one scholar gets it right all the time (not even Witherington, with his own view of Jesus as God's wisdom), but the different insights are valuable, because Jesus is bigger than what any one person can comprehend. That should be a cause for humility (something some Jesus scholars have lacked, at least in print). I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in contemporary Jesus scholarship	pos

I read the mixed reviews on this site before purchasing, so it's my own fault for still going ahead and purchasing!  I was hopeful the product would work for me. ---  --- I've tried 3 of these in different locations in my yard, all with the same result:  mounds of dirt leading right up to the Molechaser!  They seem attracted to it, not turned off by it.  I only wish I could upload a photo of the dirt mounds that literally are less than an inch away from each device! ---  --- This product has done nothing to discourage moles, voles, etc.  In all three locations, the lawn damage continues. ---  --- Don't make the same mistake I did.

Like you (I'm sure) I saw this machine on television (mistake number one) and then ordered it online without ever trying it first. This machine is a joke. If you cannot get your legs over your head then MAYBE this machine is for you. But this is NOT for serious users who stretch everyday. I can do more with my $5 stretch band from Target than I can with this big heavy space-taking piece of junk. The resistance is zero, and just laughable over all. Save yourself the money, and frustration - buy a lightweight no-hassle stretch band!	neg
This concept is very interesting and new fangled (at least to me) as far as plush animals.  The interactive/internet/game aspect is very clever and provides a lot of fun for kiddos.  I got this for my nephew and he likes it.  It keeps him entertained.  One thing--they just don't make stuffed animals the way they used to as far as quality.  Justin is not rough with his toys, and this hippo has already lost some of his hair.  I wish we could find good quality plush anymore.  I hate the idea of disposable toys because I grew up with tonka toys and teddybears that I still have.  I still have my Raggedy Ann and Andy dolls from about twenty-five years ago, and they have never lost hair.  So buy the hippo for fun, but don't expect him to survive	pos

I thought I'd be nice in giving film two stars even though it pretty much deserves none at all. I wasn't old enough at the time, but I'm sure fans were slightly bemused at the re-emergence of Friday the 13th.  Tommy, now a teenager (and a bloody old one at that) is residing at the local mental institution still traumatised by the terror of Jason and also the death of his mother.  Tommy is plagued by dreams and nightmares convinced that Jason is back from the dead.  And it seems he may be right, when a series of murders begins. But who could it possibly be THIS time. Jason is dead, isn't he? --- It's up to Tommy to fight his demons once again and get to the bottom of things before he himself becomes the victim of Jason Voorhees? --- Friday the 13th Part 5 is a perfect example of how sequels in horror can ruin what went before.  The body count in this is ridiculously high and the gore itself leaves a lot to be desired.  Was it really necessary? Is too much, too much? --- The only ounce of credibility in this film is Harry Manfredini's reprisal musical score.  Other than that, you'd be forgiven for skipping this Friday the 13th entry	neg
The idea behind this toy is great & ours has lived up to its durability claim.  My husband did not complain about adding songs to it, so it could not have been too bad.  Batteries:  this eats through them like crazy - and we used Duracell.  Volume:  the idea of volume control is good, but the highest volume is way too low.  I can't even hear anything until I get it to the mid-setting.  My 5 yr old son takes his to wrestling matches to listen while he waits his turn, but the background noise of the gym drowns out the sound in his headphones.  We probably should not have bought this until next year, maybe Fisher Price will have improved it by then	neg

Just received the flex skin and my first thought is that this is way over priced.  This is a $5.00 piece of soft plastic that will do very little to protect the unit.  It will protect against scratching, but only the areas of the unit you're not really concerned about.  The screen is totally exposed, so it can be scratched when in the unit.  I'm sure that's so you can see the screen better, but a clear protective cover (that can open and close) over the screen would have been nice.  Anyway, at $25.00 this is too much to spend.  I'm ordering a leather cover with a kick stand (which by the way you need if you want to stand it up on your desk or on a table) for less than the price of this product.  I feel I just flushed $25.00 bucks down the drain, hopefully you will not. 	neg

The Firms "Super Body Sculpt" is a 40 mins, 3 parts workout which is broken up into Upper Body, Lower Body, and Abs.  Each segment has its own warmup and cool down. It can be performed one segment at a time, or all together for a complete total body workout.  The Upper Body flies by quickly with pushups, lat rows and french presses and biceps.  The Lower Body section focuses a little too much on Squats, and by the end of your last leg press exercise, there are more squats  that will make you want to scream "Enough".  I found the Abs section too short and not enough emphasis on crunches, and too much on obliques.  The stablization exercises are a great bonus to this DVD, and are my favourite.  Overall it is very well instructed.  You can pyramid up the weights if you are strong enough, especcially during leg presses and squats.  I usually do all three segments to get the full benefits I need, and this DVD is great as a beginners tool to a firm body	pos
This is by far the best movie that I have seen that portrays the real life of a Gypsy. Though it is not a documentary, but you will learn a lot about the Gypsy way of life, their music, and most of all FLAMENCO in a very beautiful and touching story.  ---  --- Your breath will be taken away from the very first scene.

Many years ago, an acquaintance of mine was the property manager of a low-rent motel.  One morning, while he was in the back office behind the front desk, two men jumped over the counter and started beating on the door.  He could see them, but they could not see him through the privacy security glass.  The men continued to beat on the door, trying to get in.  He waited inside patiently, with his Glock pistol.  As soon as the door fell and the men ran inside, he shot them both.  They turned out to be high school teenagers who were trying to break in to obtain crack money.  I recalled that many in the community dissaproved of his actions.  It turned out that he had plenty of time to leave through the back door and call for help.  When asked why he had to kill them, he simply said, "I own the life of anyone who threatens my personal safety.  I did it because it was my right and I could."  Fortunately, it was considered self-defense. ---  --- I remembered that he always carried a short stick, attached to his keys.  It was not until many years later that I finally figured out what that little wooden stick was.  I became interested in self-defense and decided to buy a baton for myself. ---  --- This was my first Kubaton.  I was concerned because this one has a pointed end.  The pointed end, although not sharp compared to a blade weapon, will easily punch a hole through four layers of very heavy cordura cloth with little effort on my part.  I was afraid that if ever I had to use it, the amount of damage it will cause and its design would make it hard for me to claim that I was acting in self-defense.  I bought another Kubaton, from the same manufacturer, with a flat end.  The replacement baton is exactly like this one, except the end is flat.   ---  --- I tested the replacement and it will also punch a hole through heavy canvas.  But it takes a lot more force to do so.  More importantly, to the average person, it looks less aggressive than this one.  If I had to use it in self-defense, a presiding judge or jury might be less likely to think of it as a weapon. ---  --- If you are not concerned about perception, then get this pointed baton.  If it can easily punch a hole through layers of cordura cloth (the same material used in heavy duty outdoor bags, outerwear, and hiking shoes), it can easily injure an attacker who might be wearing several layers of clothes.  But please understand that some might put this in the same category as they would a knife.  That might make it difficult to claim self-defense, in the event that you have to use it to protect yourself.   ---  --- My old acquaintance was well-versed and knowledgeable.  He not only knew how to use his weapons, but he also understood where the line is between self-defense and assault.  He knew just the limits of what he could get away it in the use of deadly force to defend himself.  This pointed baton, made out of hardened aluminum alloy, is probably for such a person. ---  --- MY FRIEND'S TIP: ---  --- Here's a tip from that old acquaintance of mine.  The keys themselves are a part of the weapon.  And you can make them more effective, which will increase the damage from the baton.  Take some keys that you no longer use.  Any metal key would do, but try to find different sizes.  About four of them would do.  Take the keys to a grinder (even a rasp will do) and sharpen the teeth of each key.  Now, put the four keys in the keyring along with your regular keys.  Face the sharp keys in opposite directions.  Meaning two should face one way, but the other two should face in the opposite direction.  The idea is that when you swing the baton like a flail, the sharpened keys would cut into the attacker's flesh.  The keys are faced in opposite directions so that you can do major damage regardless of which direction that you are swinging.   ---  --- CITAN'S EXPERIMENT:  ---  --- Please keep in mind that you can also cut your hand.  I tried this technique.  I wore a pair of leather work gloves and swung against a wooden post.  The sharpened keys bounced back and hit the back of my hand.  Without the gloves, my hand would have gotten badly cut.  For what it's worth, I swung against a large watermelon and the keys didn't bounce back though.  I don't have anything else to add here, except maybe it might be good to swing against an attacker's fleshy parts to prevent the keys from rebounding.  I'm not an expert though.  But it was fun trying it on a watermelon	pos

John Waters is a very brilliant and odd film director. he brings camp, trash, filth, humor and morality to all of his movies, pushes peoples buttons, goes farther than most dare (and then some) isnt afraid of being censored and does what he does and to me thats brillance. true alot of people will think his work is tasteless stupid and gross but thats the whole point! lol! people who dont have a sense of humor or who are not open minded will not like his movies. these are not for right wing conservatives but they should see them (especially a Dirty shame) to broaden their minds a little more. my personal favorites are Pink Flamingos, A dirty Shame, Female Trouble, Polyester and Desperate Living.

For the price, this product should receive the Cruciatus Curse ad infinitum. The material is all synthetic (I was expecting a wool blend, though the ad said nothing about what the hat and scarf were made of), the relatively loose weave means it will not last as long, and one of the tassels fell off the scarf after just one wearing. I dislike being taken advantage of just so I can make my daughter happy. She is disappointed as well. It was a lot of money to pay to get the Hogwarts crest on a patch that wasn't even fully embroidered. J.K.

The Musical Director for this abomination should be called a Mutilation Director, because that is precisely what he did to the music of this show.  So the only advice I give to future Musical Directors that want to revive and revamp a show: If it's not broke, please, please, please don't try and fix it!  Some things are just perfect the way they are.  Don't buy this CD.  I did and it is now a coaster where it gets better use	neg
Purchased five of these sets thinking they would be fun stocking stuffers.  Wanting to check out what I purchased, I opened one of the five.   The geodes are tiny (not as pictured).  It was like breaking open dirt-clods... that have a small empty space inside... but not crystals.  Maybe it was a "dud" box, but will probably be returning the other four.	neg
My son loves music and really likes Dan Zanes.  We started with the videos on Disney and the "catch that train" song really got us singing, so we ordered this CD.  Now my son sings along with it, dances and jumps around.  Dan Zanes really is fun for the family	pos

This is one of those products that is good in theory but not in practice.  I thought, "OOh what a nifty idea, a head bumper!" The whole idea was great; BUT if your baby is a wiggle worm like mine, then the head bumper guard is a waste.  I actually found this item to be more of a hazard than anything.  Because my son wiggles while he sleeps he ended up with his arm stuck under the side guards wrapped in a semicircle around the bumpers.  Don't ask me how he did this.  The good thing was that if he wet through his diaper the pad underneath absorbed the urine.  Other than that it was a hassle to keep in the crib	neg
I am impressed with this product. All the parts were clearly marked. All the parts were included in the box. The directions were excellent. No complaints here	pos

I purchased this camera for my 6 yr old daughter. It isn't even good enough for a child's toy camera!  --- She had asked for a camera with a flash and screen for viewing what she had taken photos of. This camera looked like it would fit the bill. It was small and "cool" looking, had a dock (great idea), Li-ion battery (great idea) and a skin (great idea.) Unfortunately it lacks the ability to take decent photos in varied environments (We are not always outside in the sun!) If they would put a better camera in the same package it would become very desirable. --- Save yourself the grief and buy something else. I'm getting a 5MP HP (for less money even!	neg
A Man Escaped is one of those films that improves with repeat viewings. Bresson makes a strange choice in omitting the opening chapter of the memoir the film is based on which deals with the hero's curiously distant emotional response to killing a collaborator, which does throw some light on the sudden apathy and inertia that paralyses him once he is on the brink of making his much-delayed escape, but in other respects it's a perfectly contained and executed movie.  ---  --- The performances are very strong (Bresson was still aiming for naturalistic performances at this time) and the Christian allegory - that we want redemption but instinctively back away from it - is not overstrained: although this time round I noticed a few more references to religion than I recalled, it's there if you want to see it but never at the cost of turning the movie into a sermon. ---  --- New Yorker's source material is not especially good, but considering how bad most 35mm prints that go round the revival circuit are, it may well be a case of making the best of what material was available to them	pos
I thank the creators of this film which took me back to the days of growing up in Detroit.  All the time time I was learning every new Motown song and every new dance step to go with the newest hits, I had no knowledge of the Funk Brothers. I grew up on Detroit's "North End" and a lot of the Motown stars came from this area. I connected to the film immediately when it opened to snow-covered English tudor homes on Detroit's Northwest side. The film has wonderful themes: fame, success, heartbreak, the beauty of friendship among musicians, failure to be recognized, recognition much too late, and attempts of redemption, if not apology. I think the whole city of Detroit, or at least my part of it, was heartbroken with the news that Motown was moving to Los Angeles. In the film the musicians are given their due, a la their Cubano brothers and sisters in "Buena Vista Social Club.	pos
This was the break through record for Pink Floyd that would place them in the super-league. The strength of the record lies in the song writing that is simple yet engaging and Dave Gilmore's guitar playing and voice is superb. Production wise this is well polished and the presence of the sax and backing vocalists just give it that little extra commercial potential. Overall the record works well as a whole yet I do feel 'Money' seems out of place. The problem with records like this that it is too easy to enjoy and all the sharp ends are neatly filed off and well packaged for your consumption. --- Now don't get me wrong I think this is a magnificent record but is it really Pink Floyd's greatest album, I tend to think not. Is it the greatest record of all time? Most certainly not. Because a records sells 35 million copies does not make it automatically great. Because everybody and their grandmother thinks it's great, does not necessarily make it great. The problem with this record is that it sounds of its time, not that that's a bad thing, its just that it does not transcend time. The real indication of a great record is how many people it inspires to make records that sound like it. I can't think of many records that sound like this without sounding retrogressive. Some records released at the same time: Can's "Future Days"(1973); Nue!'s "2"(1973); King Crimson's "Larks' Tongues In Aspic"(1973); Robert Wyatt's "Rock Bottom"(1974); Tangerine Dream's "Phaedra"(1974) are by far more influential and enduring than Dark Side. If you don't own Dark Side then buy it because it is a very good record and deserves its five stars, but make sure you buy 'Piper at the Gates of Dawn' also. 'Piper' is Floyds greatest, most influential and definitely one of the greatest of all time. Besides, how many people who think 'Dark Side' is Floyd's best have actually heard 'Piper'.	pos
Dragons are certainly among the most quintessential elements of the fantasy genre and their likenesses comprise one of the cornerstones of the art associated with it. DragonArt: How to Draw Fantastic Dragons and Fantasy Creatures is both an enjoyable browse and a useful guide for anyone interested in creating their own dragons or other fantastic creatures with pencil and paper.  ---  --- DragonArt is divided into three major parts, Fantastic Dragons, Unique Details, and Other Fantasy Creatures, along with an introduction, a section on how to use the book, and a brief guide to fantastic creatures.  ---  --- Lessons in this book are progressive in nature, beginning with fundamentals and moving into increasingly advanced aspects of dragon design, all illustrated with step-by-step illustrations that are punctuated by helpful tips and tricks throughout. And author/artist Jessica "NeonDragon" Peffer has a clear, easy writing style that can be easily comprehended, absorbed, and acted upon, an example of which follows below.  ---  --- "Okay, so we're going to discuss the anatomy of a creature that exists nowhere but in our minds. Sounds kind of silly to say that something made from pure imagination does not look correct, but that will happen if your creature doesn't look believable. To help make your dragon as real as possible, base its structure on real creatures," she writes at one point (page 44). "The ideal dragon is likely a mix of cat, bird, and reptile body types. The trick is choosing which parts to keep and which ones to throw out. You want it to feel like a single creature."  ---  --- This advice, incidentally, is very reminiscent of that given by Leonardo Da Vinci in his notebooks for drawing creatures of this ilk, making Peffer well read or naturally very insightful, either of which speaks well for her. Under "How You Should Make an Imaginary Animal Look Natural," the increasingly famous Renaissance man writes, "You know that you cannot invent animals without limbs, each of which, in itself, must resemble those of some other animal. Hence if you wish to make an animal, imagined by you, appear natural -- let us say a Dragon, take for its head that of a mastiff or hound, with the eyes of a cat, the ears of a porcupine, the nose of a greyhound, the brow of a lion, the temples of an old cock, the neck of a water tortoise."  ---  --- DragonArt also includes guidelines on drawing a number of other sorts of fantastic creatures, including basilisks, chimeras, gargoyles, and griffins.  ---  --- For those interested in applying the guidelines presented in this book, a companion DragonArt Kit: How to Draw & Paint Fantastic Creatures that includes a compressed version of the book and some art supplies will also be available soon. Author Peffer is also the creator of the popular fantasy art Website NeonDragonArt.com, which can give anyone potentially interested in this book the opportunity to get a sense of the kinds of creatures they can learn to create themselves.	pos
Yet another historical novel into which a lot of research and work was clearly put, but the result is dissatisfying largely because the author doesn't know how to write. ---  --- My single biggest objection to this book is the constant and annoying use of the author's alternative grammatical rules.  Comma splices and run-on sentences are not, and never will be, acceptable to me.  Occasional use can be overlooked, but Shaara peppers every page with them, tacking four or five or more predicates on to the same subject.  The effect is so glaringly obvious that it becomes difficult to continue reading. ---  --- The following example is made-up, but it is a good imitation of how Shaara writes: ---  --- "He turned in the saddle, rode toward his headquarters over the ridge, refused to look back toward the man receding in the distance, focused instead on the day ahead, forced himself to confront the bigger problems at hand." ---  --- One often finds whole paragraphs composed of several run-on sentences in a row like this.  The result is a book that reads like a rough draft, or maybe not even that;  it reads like a collection of notes preparatory to writing a rough draft.  I don't understand how authors get away with publishing such half-finished work, and I don't understand why readers put up with it. ---  --- Another problem is the lack of convincing characterization.  Everyone is vaguely noble here, with the exception of a few complete cads.  Washington loves his wife and longs for peace and home.  Cornwallis loves his wife and longs for peace and home.  Greene loves his wife and longs for peace and home.  I think you get the picture.  Few characters stand out on their own.  Even Lafayette is just another young officer.  The author assumes that we already carry our own perceptions about the major characters and will plug them in at the start of the book.  And Shaara's attempts at making his characters witty never work.  The result is a cast of characters that is tedious and dull. ---  --- Beyond that, I'm doubtful about the author's device of switching focus among the various characters in each chapter.  It's fine when we leap across the Atlantic and jump into Franklin's mind.  But the rest of the time, it doesn't work well.  I find that I sometimes have to flip back to the start of the chapter to remind myself who has the focus.  Either I'm a lazy reader (and I'm not), or the device isn't working well.  In addition, this device constrains the author to keep the narrative focused almost entirely on Franklin in France, and Washington, Green, Cornwallis and Howe in America.  That means that we get only glimmers of the happenings in Parliament and the royal court in England, and the continental congress in America.  In effect, this novel is really about Washington's military camp and Howe's dinner table, which makes the narrative unbalanced. ---  --- Some aspects of the story are interesting.  I enjoy reading about Washington's maneuvers, and the repeated frustration at coming up with an empty bag and finding that the British have eluded him.  I learned a fair amount about just where the various forces were, and when.  But I wish now that I'd just bought a decent beginner's history on the war.  Most of the book, as literary fiction, left me cold	neg
My son likes this item.  The cars also fit his train set from imaginarium.  The only thing I didn't like about putting this together was the elevator.  Very tight fit and doesn't like to go up or down easily.  But everyone likes playing with it, from the 18 mo old to the 10 year olds	pos
Is there anything more sanctimonious than filming your last concert and inviting a bunch of fellow overrated hacks (Clapton, Neil Diamond, Joni Mitchell) to the occasion, as if it's some monumental event? Please! As if the Band were anything worthwhile in the first place. Sorry, but the whole concept of a bunch of Canadians (well, four of five anyway) writing this stuff about Americana always came across to me as pretentious -- and it doesn't get much worse than that stupid shot of Levon Helm wheezing through "The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down." ---  --- These guys were just the beneficiaries of Rolling Stone/elitist rock critic propaganda. (And to think they made fun of prog bands for writing inane lyrics -- huh!) I think Martin Newell put it best when he called the Band "dreadful bearded ghastliness."	neg
This is a pretty cool game that kills off the lonely, boring hours of my life, but I feel that some of the levels have too long of a time limit--Not that I can finish them that quickly, but I think they should be designed to be shorter levels. For instance, I think the Make the Moon level gives you 25 minutes to complete it. Well, that's just great if I have 25 minutes to kill, but that's quite a bit of time to just sit down and space out the world while I roll junk up into a ball. So like 10 tries on that level kills off 4 hours of my life, which gets me closer to my sweet, sweet death, but sometimes I like to have my playtimes in shorter fixes. For those times, I play Zuma, but I wish I could play a shorter version of Katamari	pos

Received exactly as stated. My only complaint is in the description- they don't state the length of the cable. My tower for my computer is in another room that I keep at 65 degrees which is maintained constantly. I had to extend this cable by soldering on another 3 feet of wire, as the usb ports that are connected to my computer are mounted on my wall. I projected the cable to be about 6 feet, and if you do yourself, you're in for a surprise. This cable is only about 3 feet long, otherwise everything is fine. One last thing...The description doesn't state this but, the cable actually comes with the drivers for the phone models, which really helped me. ---  --- On a better note, shipping took a mere two days compared to the six days USPS estimated	pos
Loved this camera the first month or so that I owned it.  Two years later my feelings are very different.  Batteries need to be recharged constantly.  Camera rarely turns on after being off it's dock for more than an hour.  All I can get is a flashing red light signifying that the batteries are dying.  Zoom is worthless, pictures turn out very blurry and pixelated.  Flash is also way too bright, half of my pictures are annoyingly "white" looking because of this.  Definitely going with Canon on my next purchase	neg
My 6 & 8 year olds sons received this toy for Christmas. They are HUGE Pokemon fans so just the fact that it has Pokemon pictures on it made the toy worth it. Fortunately, it also happens to be fun to play. 2 to 4 players try to allow the fewest balls possible past their own paddles. The fewest points wins. Each player has their own scorekeeper for up to 5 games. Setting up the game after every round gets a little tedious, however it's not so bad if everyone helps. The 2 best things for me are that I don't mind playing (unlike the actual Pokemon cards which are a boring nightmare for me!) and it doesn't require batteries!! My 3 year old daughter likes to play too although she loses every time. We just don't tell her. --- If your kids like Pokemon, this is a good toy	pos
I am a grandmother of nine!!! I heard a man playing harmonica in a furniture store while his wife shopped and it was wonderful! Instead of being annoyed, everyone within earshot was all smiles and a small crowd formed. I wanted to be able to do that also as I love music. I had tried piano and was all thumbs- but this Lee Oscar Major C Diatonic Harmonica is just the berries. It took me some time to figure out the breathing but there are lots of sources for good instruction. I would practice in the evening while my husband read. I kept saying "Honey, do you know what I'm playing?" He would say no. After about a week of this routine, my husband started to play "name that tune"! I have been so thrilled. This is a great harmonica with beautiful tones and the best price around. You won't regret this purchase if you love harmonica. I especially like the fact that the reeds can be replaced, if necessary, by unscrewing the case. This Lee Oskar harmonica is great- but the bottom line is practise. At some point I know I will feel comfortable enough to play in the hardware store while my husband shops	pos
I had a lot of fun with this stove while it lasted but it did not last long -- about six months! I live on a sailboat and I used it every day; maybe someone who goes camping once a year will have a better experience. The burner did not simmer well (the flame kept creeping back up) but the grill worked great until the stove itself died. It seems to have a design flaw -- the regulator has an unusually narrow diameter tube and the propane tubes inside the stove are flimsy and wobbly. I called Century and they said this is the way the stove is supposed to be. Hmmmm. I did not think it would last long but I liked it so much that when it died I tried out another one. This one was immediately defective and I took it back. Neither Century nor Coleman seems to make a tough propane stove any more. Camp Chef may be a better, though much more expensive, choice for a person who does a lot of camping	neg

If Shakespeare could come back to life and see what they made with his play "Othello", he would remove Heaven and Earth crying out for justice.

This adapter vignettes badly at wide-angle settings on my A700, so much so  --- that the field of view for which there is no vignetting is essentially identical --- to that without the adapter at the widest setting of the regular lens. --- Thus absolutely nothing has been gained by using the adapter.

I couldn't watch this till the end. Bad production values, gimmicky, desperate to make a point about violence and voyeurism and evil and wanting to make it evah so clevah while my neurons slowly commit suicide from the énnui.  ---  --- If you wanna go all deep thoughts on violence and still get shaken - both intelectually and viscerally - try something like Miike's "Ichi the Killer".

This book is nothing more than a chaotic brainstorm session with no pertinent information at all. You could save yourself time with a pen and some paper and a group of friends because thats all this author did. Book doesnt SHOW you how to start up any of the ideas it just lists them.

The packaging the bracelet came in was quite upscale, nice black leather case, MUCH nicer than the bracelet deserved, however. --- The bracelet itself is light weight and the heart attached is ridiculously cheap. It is not rounded as pictured, but flat like a dog tag (only much smaller). I'm using mine as a base for a charm bracelet but I would never wear it by itself. I understand though that it is NOT an expensive bracelet and the weight is probably about right for .925 silver at that price	neg
The video editing part of this software is completely useless.  It didn't come with a manual and I ended up buying on my own a book about how to use it.  It hasn't made a difference.

A little less psycho babble and a bit more logistical information would have suited me better.

My husband and I just bought the Family Feud 2nd Edition DVD TV Games. ---  --- I have to say we both LOVED this game when it was first on (and on GSN as repeats) and I like the computer version. ---  --- We played this once by ourself and a couple of times with friends and we all have found that this game was boring & as someone said they can't believe they put this out. ---  --- If you are going to get this game then buy the computer version. ---  --- You have  --- 5 rounds ---  --- Round #1 --- Round #2 --- Double Money Round --- Triple Money Round --- Fast Money Round ---  --- You have Team A and Team B. ---  --- If you get one wrong answer and you click wrong then it says go for steal. --- HOWEVER, you only get one X. ---  --- Per Guide...IF an answer is revealed that Team A did not have written down, they press Wrong Answer button and pass the remote to Team B. --- Team B now has the opportunity to steal the round. ---  --- So most of the game was passing the remote back and forth. ---  --- IF the steal answer matches any one of the remaining answers they steal the round (even if you-Team A had that written down) and takes the money for any answer the other team has answered correctly (even if they got 4 out of 5 and both Teams say have the same answer) ---  --- The game itself was simple and basic. --- There was no real fun to it. ---  --- We tried to play it with others and they said afterwards that they found it boring and not all that fun. --- One person said they would have more fun watching the game itself on TV over playing this version of the game. ---  --- You get two markers (red and blue) to write on the two wipe-clean score cards. The negative on this is that the markers do not write all that good on these cards even though they were meant to. ---  --- Another thing is that the same game will come up more than once. --- We had the same question and answer come up even though we only played twice. ---  --- This is the 3rd or 4th DVD game we have been given or bought. --- This is the only one where we disliked it so much after playing it a couple of times that we are giving it away as we will not be playing it again	neg
Wired Magazine has proven to me something it had never even occurred to me to imagine: That there is a level of cynical, style-whoring, inaccurate, myopic snarkiness that goes beyond merely "trading substance for style." Wired is consistently behind the curve these days, but that doesn't stop the publication from spinning every article like a golden truth you were too lame to know. In articles about controversial subjects, one side is routinely saddled with straw man arguments that are so blatant and artless that I find them offensive even when I disagree with the parties who have been set up for a fall. Just as often, features which don't discuss a contentious topic still have an edge to them, making fun of a person, group, or idea in a way that isn't enlightening or even humorous, let alone warranted by the subject matter. --- Generally, Wired is as mean-spirited as it is self-congratulatory. This attitude appeals primarily to the demographic of tech wonks and IT industry tourists professionally and personally deflated by the bubble burst, desperately trying to assert their relevance and relive their high-flying, know-it-all glory. Any content is easily outweighed by the sheer volume of half-truths, shoddy reasoning, and straight-up falsehoods which could easily be revealed and corrected by a casual investigation of the subjects treated in pages choked between high gloss, Yuppie/GenXer-targeted corporate mind-poison (advertising). --- Isn't the world of technology interesting and magical enough without mixing the spin, double-talk, and factual misrepresentation of a presidential debate with the impotent, absurd bravado of Battle Bot pre-match trash talk? People know little enough about how tech rules the world and how it can, quite plausibly, save it. This magazine could evangelize for technology's promise and educate about its current and future potential. Instead it concentrates on one-shots written in a style that passes for "hip" that forwards an attitude rather than a message, with an emphasis on sensationalism over accuracy, having more in common with advertising than edification	neg
I was very disappointed in the content. There were not enough color plates and transparency in the color was lacking. Many of the instructions were used with black and white sketches and plates.

This magazine is devoted to American inventions and technology that have affected our lives.  In essence, this magazine is a historical magazine about American technology.  Within each issue are multiple articles about a historical invention.  The articles can either focus on the technology or focus on an individual who has been a key contributor to the advancement of that technology.  Typically, each issue also has an interview with an inventor or inventors whose contributions have materially affected our lives or society.   ---  --- The scope of the magazine is broad.  There have been articles on the Trans-Canada highway.  Another recent issue had an excellent article on tunnel boring machines.  In yet another article the development of refinery cracking was described in the context of the development of higher performance engines.  The contribution of high octane gasoline to the winning of the air war was mentioned, an interesting piece of trivia of which I was previously unaware. ---  --- The scope of the magazine is beyond the physical sciences.  Biology and the development of medical technology are also covered.  While the magazine is written at a level that an educated non-expert can understand, some of the biology related articles challenge my attention. ---  --- This magazine is an excellent source of technological history.  However, while the technical jargon used is that appropriate to a technology, this magazine is not light reading for those unfamiliar with a specific field.  As an example, I had to read portions of the article on refinery cracking a couple of times to understand the general description of how the cracking process works.  Therefore, while I highly recommend this magazine to anyone with an interest in the history of technology, realize that for some readers, for example elementary school students, this magazine could present a reading challenge. ---  --- Most articles also provide pictures or other artwork.  Frequently this artwork is unavailable from any other magazine source because there are so few magazines that deal with technological history.  The quality of the images varies because many of the pictures have not been well-preserved, but in many cases they are the only pictures available. ---  --- This magazine frequently mentions the Inventor's Hall of Fame in Akron, Ohio, which is sponsored by the United States Patent & Trademark Office.  A number of articles have covered inductees to the Inventor's Hall of Fame, showing that while the articles are historical in nature, they are also currently relevant. ---  --- There are a large number of magazines that are either about technology, or have had articles about technology.  There are a large number of trade magazines that cover technology.  Sometimes these magazines even have articles about the history of an invention.  However, the "American Heritage of Invention & Technology" is the only magazine of which I am aware the covers the history of invention and technology.  While the focus of the articles is American technology, it is inevitable that the relationship of foreign invention is covered occasionally as well when that technology was important in the development of American technology.  I consider this magazine to be excellent for anyone with an interest in historical technology, and is an excellent complement to other historical magazines.	pos

This shaving brush is perhaps the most inexpensive way to get a pure Badger bristle shaving brush. I've now been using it for a year and a half, and it has not shed any real amount of its bristles like the cheaper brushes on the market. The brush head remains densely packed and quite soft. Hopefully, it will remain that way for some time to come. In the meantime, I do enjoy the close and comfortable shaves that are aided by this brush. Because of it, I have sworn off of canned shave gels for every situation except travel. They just can't compare to your average $1.50 cake of shaving soap and this brush.

It is reputed to relax the muscles of the digestive system which helps relieve nausea. Peppermint combats flatulence, promotes bile flow and digestive juices, and has a mildly anesthetic effect which also eases indigestion. It is supposed to relieve anxiety and tension, soothe headaches and calm symptoms associated with the menstrual cycle. ---  --- Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface	pos
In 1976, MY FAIR LADY returned to Broadway, in a revival touted as the "20th Anniversary" production.  Perhaps most famously, this particular revival was the first big professional splash of a young soprano called Christine Andreas...   ---  --- At long last, this much sought-after cast album gets its CD premiere.  Christine Andreas is one of the best Eliza's ever captured on disc, and Ian Richardson's performance as beleaguered tutor Higgins is full of wit and humour.  George Rose (in a Tony-winning turn as Eliza's dustman father) is very enjoyable in his main numbers "With a Little Bit of Luck" and "Get Me to the Church on Time".  Jerry Lanning also makes for a fine Freddy, with the winsome "On the Street Where You Live". This recording also features the "Embassy Waltz" sequence, which was never included on the OBC, and only featured as a bonus track on the reissue of the OLC. ---  --- The production itself heavily recreated the original production, complete with Oliver Smith's sets and Cecil Beaton's costumes.  Hanya Holm's choreography was revived thanks to original dance captain Crandall Diehl.  Christine Andreas picked up a Theatre World Award for her breakthrough performance.  The show opened at the St. James Theatre on March 25th 1976, but later moved to the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre where it closed the following year after 377 performances.   ---  --- The following year, Andreas returned to Broadway in another important revival, the 1978 production of "Oklahoma!" in which she made a thrilling Laurey (cast album available on RCA); before cememting her position as Broadway's ingenue of choice, with the role of Frankie Frayne in the 1983 revival of "On Your Toes" (cast album available on Jay/TER).  More recently, she played Marguerite St. Just, in the original company of Frank Wildhorn's flawed "Scarlet Pimpernel" (cast album available on Atlantic). ---  --- I heartily recommend this particular MY FAIR LADY	pos
I also purchased this product & was extremely disappointed when I found out it did NOT work.  Like the 1st reviewer wrote, it basically is a mini-fan that moves BUT it does NOT cool the car down at all!  There was absolutely NO difference in the temperature of my car after I installed it!  DON'T waste your money	neg
I bought my wife a Nuvi 350 for her birthday last August (overall, we love the Nuvi, but the mount...no). The biggest "advantage" of the Nuvi over other GPS systems is its portability. Unfortunately, the suction cup appears to have been designed to subvert this feature. The cup sticks to the first window it is attached to very well...and then won't let go. When we tried to transfer it (after being attached only a couple of days), it left pieces of itself to the windshield and was very difficult to reattach to another windshield (though with difficulty and repeated tries, we have been able to move it).  ---  --- What this means is that you need a mount for each car you want to use this in. The mount and the charging/power wire (which you will also need since it is cumbersome to remove from the mount) are pretty darn expensive ($60-70) which is ridiculous for a "portable" system	neg
I played "Atmosfear, The Harbingers" on VHS in the mid-90s and several years later bought a copy of the game through ebay.  Then, I saw this DVD update and gave in to temptation when the price was marked down.  Here's my judgement: 1) The mechanics have been simplified.  This has it's pros and cons.  It could have been made easier to learn without removing as many components.  2) The gatekeeper has less of a nasty/funny balance in the DVD update.  3) It is a major upswing to have his dialogue randomly disbursed. ---  --- One reviewer seemed to think the game was boring.  I'll guess, instead, that the people he parties with don't have the attention span for board games.  Too bad for them.  Atmosfear - The DVD Board Game get's a B+ from me	pos
i think the people who give one stars aren't following the directions...wash your car at sunset and it dries perfectly (even in texas)...i don't think it really matters how you wash it; using the filtered water and not drying the car in the sun is what gives you no streaks or spots...the only problem i have is that it uses more soap than stated on the product...also the filter doesn't as long as i would like...this might be 'cause i was washing a van and not a smaller vehicle..	pos

I've owned many pens over the years, expensive and cheap, but this Parker stands out as my "everyday" favorite. Yes a Mount Blanc is fine, but I've never felt comfortable carrying one around in everday work since I could lose it. The parker, on the other hand, is like a good pair of blue jeans--comfortable and accessible. Additionally, the styling will grow on you--it's unpretentious yet refined. A true classic	pos
The ideas behind 15 minutes aren't bad at all. Take one Robert DeNiro, put him in New York, mix him with some American-dream hunting Eastern Europeans on a killing spree, and try to provoke some emotions, and have a sly dig at the American justice system. Lets see...nothing happened...only repulse. ---  --- If, like everyone else, you plan on watching this film because DeNiro is in it, you will be dissapointed. He puts in a tired performance, almost as if he knows the film is a load of B.S. The attempt to be hard-hitting goes horribly wrong, instead it's just repulsive over the top violence, and its pointless...naked prostitute gets hacked to pieces, why? There are ways to create provoking films with such violence but they have to have meaning, such as 8mm (the horrible subject of snuff movies, hard-hitting meaningfull film), 15 minutes is far from meaningfull. We all know there are some deranged psychopaths out there doing just that, but when converting it to a film, it needs a deeper meaning, otherwise it turns into melodramatic Hollywood [...]. ---  --- If you like brain-dead gore and violence, lack of plot and cringing melodrama. Go ahead	neg
Item never came.  However in their defense refund was promptly given out.  I only wish that I had a chance to receive this one	neg
I already have a single jogging stroller (not a BOB) and have been happy with it. We are in the process of adopting our second child, which we had less than 24 hours notice about, so a lot of money is going to legal costs, baby stuff, and my time off of work, and as a result I was concerned about spending this much on a stroller, but is was worth every cent. With the BOB Duallie, I am ecstatic, overjoyed, delighted, thrilled and looking forward to my next trip out.  ---  --- For my first trip out, I put my 2 year old and 11 week old in and went for a six mile walk. The trip was so smooth, both kids slept for most of the time. The seats recline enough so that my baby is nearly flat, no problems with his head bobbing around (pardon the pun). The shocks give this stroller an incredibly smooth ride, which transits to less work for my arms. I didn't realize how much effort went into the other stroller, pushing it and turning it. The smooth ride also allowed us to walk faster, a plus when trying to lose weight. ---  --- The stroller can turn in circles on itself, allowing for extremely sharp turns. Very nice, especially when inside a small store, like Starbucks. The windows up top are well placed enough that I can actually see my kid's face, not just their little bodies. The straps are the easiest to adjust of any stroller I've used. There is extra padding along the shoulder straps to cushion the kid's shoulders. The straps at the waist don't come out of the sides, (this is kinda hard to explain) the strap is attached in the center of the seat, and the sides come around the child, more like a belt and allowing for a snugger fit. Even my 70 year old mother had a great time pushing the stroller.  ---  --- As for the Mesa Orange, it is more like a burnt orange, with brown trim and I am very glad I got it! It is not at all like the neon orange it appears in some of the photos. Be sure to get the tray, I forgot to order it with the stroller. The storage is a little shallow, but being double wide, there is still plenty of room for stuff.	pos
This is a great item for any collector or new fans to the X-men. All the older along with the newer issues look great. The CD includes all issues of the Uncanny X-men (1-461) along with Giant Sized and annual issues. There is also comprehensive biographies on the more popular characters and artwork and layouts of the Xaiver Institute. Could it of had more content, maybe, but this will keep one busy for a long time. With easy maneuverabiltity, this is a highly addictive CD with virtually months of entertainment	pos
One at the front: The really own words of the master are excellent. One must make sure that only 43 sides of the only 7 x 5 inch small book are interviews with Bruce Lee. The rest consists of interviews with the former  interviewers. However, as a paperback this book costs not really a fortune.  But the words of the master are absolutely worth-while, as already  mentioned at the beginning	neg
Yes, it plays videos (DivX + Windows Media tested so far). ---  --- Yes, it plays and sorts your photos. ---  --- Yes, it plays MP3s and sorts them by their ID3 tags (artist/genre/album/etc.). ---  --- Yes, it comes with a good TV audio/video out cable (letting you use the Zen like a high-def digital video player). ---  --- Yes, you can download your CompactFlash card directly onto the Zen hard drive. ---  --- Yes, it syncs with your Outlook tasks and calendar.  Wha?  Yeah.  It's hidden in there too.  Along with an MP3 alarm clock. ---  --- If you're going on vacation with a digital camera anytime soon, this is the multi-tool for you.  Leave the laptop at home.  The Zen has plenty of battery life and plenty of room for music, movies and photos to keep you moving for days when you're unwired from the office	pos
I opened one packet (which was quite large for a serving, and shared it with 3 others in my office. We all took one spoonful and in unison said it was terrible. No one could continue eating it, and I sent back 8 of the 9 packets. Not edible, in our humble opinion.  --- Sorry	neg
I think this is a great film.  Many critics and a few reviewers always complain about it's running time (128 minutes), insisting it's too slow.  Almost ALL of Clint's films (the ones he's directed) run long.  The running times range from just over 2 hours to just under 3 hours (the longest being Bird, at 2 hours, 40 minutes).  Sure, the film isn't PC, but it was made in 1975, when you didn't have to be PC.  But there is one thing that almost everyone agrees on...the mountain climbing scenes at the end of the film.  These are nervewracking and incredibly authentic.  Clint did all his own stunts in these sequences, and many professional rock climbers and mountaineers have praised these sequences.  And they are very intense to watch, because you know the actors are really up there.  No CGI in those days.  This is one of the reasons they work so well.  CGI looks fake anyway.  It makes movies seem like cartoons.  People know it isn't real.  CGI reliance should be reduced in Hollywood, as it takes the tension out of action scenes.  ---  --- Check this film out.  It's worth all of its 128 minutes.   --- 	pos
Because of tummy troubles, my doctor ordered me on a very bland diet.  Well this stuff is JUST what the doctor ordered, as it is almost completely tasteless.  I can't give it a one star which qualifies as  hating it, as I can't hate anything that has pasta as one of the ingredients, but it is not good.  It makes Kraft Mac and Cheese seem very exciting!  I would not reorder and would fear ordering anything else from Annie's.  This would only be for young children who hate anything with a taste to it	neg
I had seen the "gold/orange" face version of this Casio watch for years but didn't know it came in black (and white) until I found it on Amazon. I really like the classic good looks of this watch... nice rugged case, smooth-clicking rotating bezel, sturdy band, etc. For <$60, this watch truly delivers awesome quality and value. The digital features are great too. I've received a few compliments from co-workers on this watch already. Overall, an awesome watch for the money and I couldn't be happier with it	pos

Who would give the green light to this?  ---  --- It is a total remake of the 1968 classic. The only difference is that there is  a slight revamp to reflect modern times.  ---  --- Since it mirrors the original then it deserves what the biggest complaint hsould be of it...it pales in comparison to the original. This was really weird to remake this movie.  ---  --- "Dawn of the Dead" was cool b/c it had a new, fresh spin to the story. This has no scares, no atmosphere, no innovations and no riveting performances.  ---  --- Skip this one 	neg
How many times can you wear out the same story line. Kahlan lost, Kahlan found, Kahlan lost again, Kahlan found again. Or Richard lost, Richard found, ohp...Richard lost again, Richard found again.

They sparkle well and look as good as anything else I have seen at the mall stores.  I like the non-cup style studs, as I think they allow more light to flow through the stone.

I have very fond memories of this short lived Irwin Allen classic.The picture and sound on the dvd's is better than i remember.The video transfer is very nice and the sound is crisp albeit in mono.I give volume one of the "Time Tunnel" five stars for pure television enjoyment.Volume one contains the first 15 episodes of the show,The unaired extended version of the pilot,Irwin Allen's behind the scenes home movies, visual effects,camera test,still galleries and promotional tv and radio spots.Once again it is lacking in cast interviews. many of the actors from this show are still alive,so why didn't the studio interview them for the dvd set?.It would be a welcomed addition to any release to see the actors today and get their thought's on the show.My only gripe is that this show only ran for one season,so why split it into two volumes?.Surely the studio could have compiled all 30 episodes into one boxed set at a reasonable price	pos

I give this movie 1 star because it lies to the viewer. This movie is NOT Bram Stoker's Dracula, but a rip-off of the character and then puts the modern spin on the story. If it was named something else or even kept the name Dracula out of it to begin with but called him a different name I'd give it 5 stars. ---  --- If you want to see the real Dracula story first read the actual book by Bram Stoker, then watch the silent film Nosferatu. Nosferatu is the only Dracula movie that gets the story right. Dracula is a monster, he's not a star crossed lover at all and wasn't intended to be. People wanted there to be some hidden message so they could justify a reason for their otherwise worthless literature degree but there simply isn't one. It's a horror tale, not a vieled porn book, and certainly not a love story. If anything the ones that fail to understand Dracula time and again are his victims who fall prey to his seduction by being anthropomorphic toward him	neg
I bought these because they come with foam inserts to help collect leakage. I'm a 38 DD and use the large flange for my medela pump, so I too found the sharp edge that contacts the breast was cutting into my sore areola/nipple.

My sore nipples got nearly instantly better using my brest friend (great proper latch!), and treatment for a mild yeast infection. Hope this helps	neg
I have been suffering from depression since I was 15 years old. My mother bought this bracelet for me at the age of 21 as a surprise (after some hinting; I was patiently waiting to buy it on my own!) I must say it is one of the most beautiful and meaningful gifts anyone has ever given to me. I don't believe I have taken it off for a single day in the several months I've owned it; it fits perfectly, matches everything and its beautiful message keeps me more centered and hopeful. It also keeps me feeling close to my mother while I'm away at college. She doesn't know it yet, but I hope to buy her the same bracelet for Christmas. It's a simply amazing gift for yourself or someone else	pos
The railings on the Schwinn 820p did not line up with the screw holes on the frame by several inches!  It was impossible to assemble. ---  --- With any quality control at all, these measurements are checked on every item that leaves the factory.  Human error is then not a factor.  This is a defect that should never happen. Schwinn/Nautilus has zero quality control.  That is simply a fact of the most basic quality control standards.   ---  --- You are therefore definitely taking your chances with this or any other Schwinn or Nautilus product.  With zero quality control, no telling what else can prove to be wrong. ---  --- And though the warranty says "1 year on parts", the warranty then goes on to say that there will be a charge for the installation of any defective or replaced parts.  So what is the 1 year warranty on labor?  Nothing, obviously. ---  --- I wish I never had purchased this product, myself	neg
My children have loved playing in this tent. I like it also because it is not huge and doesn't take up a lot of room, but it is also not made out of very durable material.

This book is terribly organized.  I'm not sure what happened in writing this book, but it seems clear that Professor Jones did not compile this in the chronological order that it is printed in. ---  --- My main complaint is that rather obscure concepts/people/events are repeatedly referred to, and then only later does Jones bother to define them.  (I would almost prefer that he not define something at all, rather than offering a definition 100 pages after his first reference to it!)  The fact that the book has an index only further infuriated me - clearly the author/publisher knew where all these terms were located throughout the book, yet did not bother to offer a definition in the appropriate/first reference to the concept. ---  --- Examples are numerous, but here are a few: --- **robe nobility: referenced on pages 139, 152, 183.  Defined? (pg. 183) --- **sans culottes: first referenced on page 189, defined on page 231. --- **Louis-Sebastien Mercier: referenced on pages 11, 138, 178, 189, 200, 204, 212, 213.  When did Jones provide information (that he was a "journalist, dramatist and observer of Parisian mores") on just WHO Mercier is?  Page 215. ---  --- Aside from that, there are some plain old errors.  One such is in the text box on Saint Genevieve.  Jones mentions that she negotiated with Frankish military chieftains in the 570s and 580s.  She died in 512AD, so the negotiations seem improbable.  (470s & 480s would be correct, but I should not have to figure that out.) ---  --- The redeeming quality of the book is that if DOES offer information on Paris if you are willing to sift through the above mentioned annoyances.  And Paris is not such a bad subject	neg
First thing to do is to make sure which lens you are buying. The kit lens comes with Canon 20D, 30D, 300D, or XT is the lower version, non USM one. On the higher version USM ones, you will see the red color "USM" at the front of the lens.   ---  --- According to the reviews, compare with the non USM ones, optically they are the same. However, the USM motor does focus faster and much quieter.  ---  --- People complain about the build quality. Actually I feel that it is really not that bad, much better than the Canon 50mm f1.8 II. The USM auto focus performance is fast, never hunt, and much quieter than the 50mm f1.8 II. It fits nicely on the XT. ---  --- Do not compare this hundred dollar lens to other lenses cost three times or more. We have to compare apple to apple. If you know the limitations on this lens and use it wisely, the images will come out nicely.  ---  --- 1. This is not the lens for indoors low light conditions. If you need to take lots of indoor pictures and the flash is not allowed, go get a different lens. (For example, I use a Canon 50mm f1.4 for this kind of situation.) ---  --- 2. The distortion on 18mm is quite a bit. Avoid taking strait lines (like buildings) pictures on the edge while wide open. However, this can be easily corrected on computers. ---  --- 3. Step down the aperture to F8 or F11, the resolution will be improved a lot even at the corners.  ---  --- Overall, the performance is very good for a hundred dollar lens. It is very light weight and highly portable while traveling. This fits my needs as a cheap but fast with good image quality walk around lens. 	pos

I got this for X-mas and I am a huge Spyro fan! I started with the second one and this is now the fifth release not counting gameboy games, and the second on Playstation 2. The last one, Enter the Dragonfly wasn't SO successful and I feared there wouldn't be another; but here it is! And SO many things have been added. Buying items at item shops, keychains for keys to open boxes, riding around in the professors new gadget ball, mini-games featuring not Spyro, but his friends,etc. i kind of miss flying Spyro through the rings in the speed race, but...This new Spyro is clearly trying to keep up with newer platform games that others seem to enjoy, but luckily they have kept things from being too hard that you give up eventually and you don't have to worry about wandering around and getting lost in the game. Spyro must learn new tricks like spin pole,etc. as he moves along, and he even meets little dragons like him- Ember,Flame. Hard enough to keep you playing to get through the challenge, but it never seems overwhelming. Some of the mini-game's second levels are a pain, but you can come back later. The strategy guide is also helpful. This time, I don't think anyone can complain that Spyro hasn't evolved or that it's the same old thing, but Spyro fans love Spyro even if it was the same game but with new adventures and levels. He's Spyro! Hours of enjoyment	pos

I have used this pillow for the last 2 months, with 2 to go.  I do like the shape of the pillow, I just wished it was a little longer.  I had been trying to use a king size pillow to cuddle with, but it was TOO big and hard to turn with.  This pillow makes it easy to keep next to you and to turn over.  I would just like it to be longer so I can have the little end between my legs, and the rest up higher so I can cuddle with it.  When between my legs (which helps) the rest of the pillow only is around my stomach and I wish it came up to my breast area so my arms could cuddle around it a little easier.  I would still give one to a pregnant friend as it is nice to sleep with.  Beware, my husband calls this the "Sperm Pillow", but if you can get past that, it's a nice pillow. 	pos

The review before this one is what got me interested with this produce and so I decided to buy it and let me tell you, it was the best choice ever. I have no real experience with any other wipes, but have read reviews of all the promes other have given like wipes dry out or turn color...THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN WITH THIS ONE. I love that I just put the whole pack in, plastic and all, and it stays nice and toasty for my son's bottom. He loves it and no longer has to deal with cold wipes anymore. I love the spring inside to keep the wipes on top. I love that it heats from the top. The wipes never turn yellow and is ALWAYS moist. I also love the little handle on the top, so I just have to pull the plug and easily carry it to another room if need be! The product is hight recommended	pos
This is the Japanese version of breadcrumb (pan=bread, a Portuguese loan-word, and"ko-"  is "child of" or of "derived from".) Panko are used for katsudon, tonkatsu or cutlets served on rice or in soups. The cutlets, pounded chicken or pork, are coated with these light and crispy crumbs and fried. They are not gritty and dense like regular crumbs. They are very nice on deep fried shrimps and decorative for a more gourmet touch	pos
I bought this product for my 3 month old for Christmas and when I went to play with it, the remote didn't work. I did everything it said to do and it still didn't work. So, I took it back and just exchanged it for another thinking it was just faulty. When I took it out, the remote to it also didn't work. It says it has to be on "Play" (not Try me or Off) and it has to do it's short musical fanfare after you push the button on the front and then you can use the remote but nope. You should be able to control the volume, the song options, and be able to switch from colors to music but no. It just plain doesn't work. I really want it to work because it would be great in the car but sadly, I will have to take it back but this time I'll get my money back......I do not suggest buying this product	neg
If you find iMovie complicated, this product is not for you.  If you prefer automatic quick solutions this product may not be for you.   ---  --- If you find that you would like more control of your video/audio than you find in iMovie but don't want to spend a lot of money, boy have you come to the right place. ---  --- I take quite a lot of home video (new baby and all) and found that iMovie would frustrate me when I couldn't do some more advanced tasks. ---  --- iMovie is a great intro product.  If you are new to video, use it until you find that you feel limited (many will never will get to that point). ---  --- When (and if) you find that you feel some constraints in iMovie, then move up to FCE. ---  --- A note for most, iMovie and FCE typically are not for DVD/Hard Drive camcorders.  They don't have the output necessary to directly connect.  You may want to check with your camcorder manufacturer to see what they have to convert the DVD/HD to content that is usuable in these products	pos

The music on this album is performed so exquisitely; the orchestrations so subtle and yet illuminating, that one is almost tempted to forget what a "What for?" musical this is.  ---  --- Donna Murphy plays the title character of Fosca, a hugely unprepossessing woman who suffers from more maladies than there are stars in the sky. She lives in a remote miltary outpost where she falls in love with the handsome, virile Giorgio. Giorgio in turn is having a torrid affair with the beautiful, but vapid Clara, a married woman back home. However from the time Giorgio comes into Fosca's sphere, she becomes this relentless succubus in her pursuit of him. She shows up EVERYWHERE he happens to be; her ferocity matched only by her inexhaustive capacity for self-pity. To depict Fosca musically, Sondheim comes up with the most monochromatic score of his career. Everything is SO lugubrious, dark, portentous, tragic; punctuated by militaristic strains (with snare drums)because the soldiers like to...umm...march.  In the end, Giorgio is worn down enough by Fosca's attentions that he succumbs. He believes he has fallen in love with her, shortly after which she...dies. ---  --- As I mentioned earlier, the material is beautifully performed (Marin Mazzie and Jere Shea render the opening "Happiness" with a marvelous sense of delicacy and sensuality. Donna Murphy evokes the proper pathos in the haunting "Loving You."), but you come away wondering what the point of it all is. If Sondheim is trying to show us how love is largely a chronic disease, then he succeeds admirably	neg
I am totally a fan of cloth diapering now that I've actually done it.  I must admit I was very apprehensive before I actually used them because I thought it would be so much work, but it really amounts to doing a load of laundry every other day... not hard.  These diaper covers are fantastic.  I have not had a single leak with them.  When my daughter was first born, a friend gave us several packs of newborn disposable diapers that we used for the first few weeks, and we had numerous leaks.  We actually used the newborn size of Super Whisper Wrap for the first two months and are on the small size now.  She was 6 pounds 11 ounces when she was born.  I use the chinese prefold diapers with them.  I tried two different types of the Gerber prefold, but they're just not as absorbant and were quickly saturated.  What sold me on these covers is how I can wash them with diapers when they are soiled and I don't have to hand wash them or anything	pos
The last reviewer didn't see any point to this software. Partially that's true---you don't need it to create your photostamp, you can do the same thing online. However, there is one big plus to the software product: buying a single sheet of PhotoStamps direct from their website costs $24.99 + $2.99 shipping, at this writing. In contrast, Amazon is selling this "boxed" version ---which includes a free voucher for a single sheet of stamps---for seven bucks less than that. Do the math	pos

Just today I randomly selected a movie, that movie was "Henry".  I had never heard of it before, and I figured that I was in for your average, run-of-the-mill low budget slasher flick.  Though it is low budget, it is by no means your ordinary serial killer movie.  In fact, the gritty film and minimalist effects only adds to the stark realism of this nightmarish character study. ---  --- Meet Henry, a very quiet and serene man with vacant and staring eyes as well as a calm disposition.  Watch as he goes to work, watch as he hits the bar with his buddy Otis, and watch as he calmly and systematically butchers random people.  This film does not exploit the violence though; it is very frank and direct, treating it as though Henry were doing nothing more than cleaning the dishes or taking a stroll in the park. ---  --- This movie is a lot of things, and when it was all over, I just had to sit back and take a few breaths, have a cigarette - and try to gauge my reaction(s).  I was surprised to note that while this film is disturbing, it is also pretty funny in some parts, though only funny in the blackest sense of the term.  There is no social commentary in this movie, nor does it provide any closure.   ---  --- The DVD is great, awesome extras including fragmented interviews with the genuine serial killer Henry Lee Lucas, awaiting lethal injection on death row.  Very fascinating	pos

Pros: Uses less batteries than the Space Shuttle... (6 AAs) ---  --- Great idea gone to H*** quickly due to LACK OF PRODUCT SUPPORT!

Red, blue,white pearl (paper?) - Yellow smiley faces. Green metalic.

I have had this awesome little device for about 5 years now.  In that time there have been TWO attempts by car thieves to take my car (a Honda Civic).   ---  --- The first attempt it looks as though they saw it and moved on (door was open, things shuffled about).  This was while it was parked at my school in the midst of a string of Honda Civic thefts (there had been no less than 10 thefts of modified civics in the past two months--which is what inspired me to buy this).  Given the context of the situation and since nothing else was taken or disturbed, the only logical conclusion is that they were after the car itself. ---  --- The second attempt was by a much more aggressive would-be thief.  This one worked at the clutch lock for a good long time.  When I got to my car the next morning, the clutch pedal covering was broken off and the pedal bar itself was bent slightly off to the right, however the lock remained solidly in place.  They even broke into my trunk to retrieve the tools to try and pry it off.  They had no such luck.  The pedal cover was replaced for $10 and all was well. ---  --- I would trust any car to this in any situation.  Certainly you should use an alarm as well, and be conscious about where you leave your car, but this is a fantastic deterrent. ---  --- This product is the best 60 bucks I have ever spent on my car.  GET IT	pos
Drummer Hoff is an unusual story that uses repetitive phrases and rhyming to tell the story of Drummer Hoff, the man who "fired it off." In this story, a group of men are preparing to fire a cannon. Each man brings something different. One man brings the barrel, one man brings the carriage, and at the every end of each stanza it says "but Drummer Hoff fired it off." ---  This story uses childlike drawings to demonstrate the pattern of rhythm in the story. The colors are fairly bright which in turn give the story a comical appeal. The story itself doesn't have any significant moral element to it...it is just a fun book. The rhyming in this story is very catching and the pictures really make the story very humorous. By the end of the story the reader can see that the big explosion has just caused a big mess. ---  --- Children will like the flow the story and parents will enjoy reading it aloud. A good holiday gift.	pos
The texture of this cleanser is waxy.  I could barely get it off my face, and I broke out badly after using it.

I tried to think of alternate uses for the product, but finally threw it away	neg
At first loved it because the travel system, with stroller, is so light and doesn't look doudy like other systems.  --- But: the harness buckle is so difficult to fasten that the baby gets irritated before we even get to the car. The straps never tangled, but it is extremely difficult to adjust as needed. The carrying handle has to moved up/down with two hands, a button on each, that must be simultaneously pushed to lower the handle. Difficult to perform when you're already reaching into the center of the car to even get to the baby. --- Yes it is a trendy color with the gray, but it is not cotton and is not padded well and does not breathe! It is horribly hot for the baby. Still love the stroller by combi, but I never recommend the car seat to ANYONE. Luckily, time to move 5 month old to a larger seat anyway.	neg

I am by no means a computer idiot, I audit computer systems security for a living. I have had to contact customer support (webchat) at least 3-4 times during the first 30 days of installing the software. The install was on a brand new system (Windows XP Pro), with all of the Microsoft patches and service packs and little to nothing else installed.  ---  --- First Pest Patrol would crash numerous times a day until technical support walked me through a complex workaround to prevent an Active Protection error window appearing over 100 times every 10 minutes (which you had to click to clear each one). Second, the firewall would tell me I was not authorized to visit certain webpages until technical support walked me through a complex process of deleting certain files created by the firewall and resetting the firewall after a process involving safe mode. Third, Pest Patrol never would run a thorough scan. I'd receive two separate errors that either said a fatal error occurred with the Pest Patrol GUI, or that system resources was not available. I contacted the customer support and they told me that yes, sometimes Pest Patrol doesn't work at all unless you use MSCONFIG to disable all startup services (systems.ini, etc) reboot, run Pest Patrol, then use MSCONFIG to enable the startup services. It was a canned reply during a live web session, which means that the operators were probably used to giving since it likely occurs to many people. ---  --- I haven't tried out the third solution yet because I wanted to remind myself to write an Amazon review. ---  --- If you are looking for simplicity, or don't know much about computers, look elsewhere. Otherwise you will be in for one major headache trying to implement several technically involved workarounds. I'll give it two stars, since it didn't cause my dog to choke, explode my house, or cause irreparable damage to clothing (which is my one-star). 	neg
This effort shows it's age. In addition, there is a uncomfortable tone in the narration that smacks of a reliance on a pseudo-scientific method somewhat reminiscent of Mengele. I suppose it's possible for it to be taken as tongue-in-cheek by those at the post-graduate level of study at the Cheech and Chong School of Anthropology. However, I have to admit I was unable to prevent myself from throwing this one in the trash after one viewing	neg
When this show was on back in the day on Fox I couldnt believe I was actually watching something I could relate to. There doesnt seem to be really that many Tv shows that deal with dark and The Real Life experinces of Real People. If ya ask me when it was on. It was actually something that gave me some relief. I deal everyday with some experinces re-lated to the show. Its somewhat of a constant battle. Enough about me. Im really glad all 3 Seasons are out. And im also glad I didnt have to wait many years either. One thing I didnt like about Fox when Titus was on they kept moveing it around. It wasnt fair for the show. Then the next thing ya know there were some repeats then it was gone. Im not really happy with Fox cause Titus still should be on tv or had a much longer run then it did. I hope Chris shows up in something else soon. Hes got one of those faces ya never forget	pos
I did the research on this product and it was one of the best. I don't know that to be true due to the fact that the software that they sent me was a demo version that was outdated for use.

I never subscribe to anything! This magazine is great. There are usually quite a few recipes with ingredients that are easy to find and a nice mix of healthy recipes and indulgent recipes.

I've made 4 of the recipes out of this last Everyday Food issue and they were very healthy (lots of veggies, chicken, brown rice, salmon etc.) tasted really good, and were also fast which is a bonus for me. I'd give this magazine 10 stars if I could :-	pos

Flying Down to Rio is the film that marks the first pairing of Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire. The two are not the main attraction though; the film stars Dolores del Rio and Gene Raymond in a tempestuous love affair. Raymond is a band leader who always falls for beautiful women. Del Rio is engaged to a man in Rio de Janeiro but secretly harbors feelings for the American. In a back and forth romance, the two occupy plenty of the film. The rest is taken by extravagant musical numbers including "I Like Music," "The Carioca," and "Orchids in the Moonlight" on top of a wonderful number that exhibits chorus girls dancing on top of airplanes! ---  --- The cast is good and the story is pretty standard, but it is the music that spices up the film. Definitly take a look at this movie, which is filled with inuendo only pre-code films could get away with and music only those early musicals featured	pos
The installation instructions require you to tighten the fitting to the point that you break the little black intstallation tool.  Once the tank is empty it can not be refilled unless the station has an adapter.  I have not found a station with one yet.  You can not get the adapter off the tank with out the tool you broke.  They dont sell the black tool and it's designed so nothing else fits.  You have to purchase the whole fitting just to get the tool.  Another $17.00 down the drain. After my third one, I finally fabbed a tool out of a bolt head by grinding the head into the right shaped triangle. 	neg

I had never read any of  Vernor Vinges books before, but i had heard he was an excellent author, so I thought I would try this.  Boy, am I glad I bought it used on Amazon for about only $4.  I simply had no idea what was going on in this novel. The plot is unintelligible. I dont know what the Bioweapon  the jacket refers to is? I dont know what "the Rabbit" is.  I see that numerous other reviews here, did not know what was going on either. I do not understand how someone could write so incoherently.  --- The concept of someone who had Alzheimers getting cured & entering a future society is great - but it never goes anywhere.  The only reason I did not fall asleep, was that I was trying to figure out what was going on, but I did could not  even finish this book	neg

Malfunctions: --- 1. The port for connecting to a PC became loose and unreliable, frequently disconnecting while I was trying to transfer music. --- 2. The little knob stopped working properly:  it was no longer possible to fast-forward. --- 3. Finally, the screen cracked for me and no longer displayed anything. ---  --- Design issues: --- It would be nice to be able to access music by ID3 tag (i.e. artist, genre, song title). --- It takes a long time to start up, generally ~20 seconds but up to ~2 minutes if you just changed the music on it. --- It's nice that you can delete music on the player without having to connect it to a computer, for instance if you have it on shuffle and you come across something that you never want to hear again.  However, the interface to do this was so inconvenient (including audio playback stopping and long lag times) that I rarely used this feature in practice. --- The earbuds that come with it didn't stay in my ears well; I bought new ones. ---  --- Good things: --- I loved the fact that it had an FM radio and a voice recorder (the reasons that I bought it). --- It's easy to access the hard drive from any computer, without any software needed. --- The large storage capacity proved fully necessary. --- You can change playback modes with a single button press (shuffle versus ordered, all songs versus current folder only). ---  --- My basis for comparison:  I've also owned a Creative Zen Jukebox (which I liked a lot but which I sold because I wanted the FM radio and voice recorder on the iAudio) and, currently, a used fourth generation iPod, which has been working well so far except for some occasional quirks	neg

Xenosaga: Episode 1 took us in. Although the flaws in that game were many, the story was sufficiently entertaining and interesting to warrant the praise that was given to the game, and the clunky play mechanics. ---  --- Xenosaga: Episode 2 was awful. Plain and simple, it was awful. Any of the interesting cliff-hangers from episode 1 were either answered stupidly, or not at all. The game not only possessed a lackluster storyline, with extra characters introduced merely for confusion's sake, but I have NEVER seen a battle system more user-unfriendly, and more monotonous and clunky than that of episode 2. At times, I wanted to throw my PS2 against the wall, particularly when fighting the patriarch. A terrible game which seemed to kill the series... ---  --- ...until Episode 3, which is a throwback to simpler RPG fare, and works quite well. In Episode 3, the battles are actually interesting to fight (at least early on - I enjoy the use of the boost counter for once!). No more will you guess at whether Shion's attack is useful against enemy A, or whether you should switch to, say, chaos. Instead, characters are divided into three classes: attackers, defenders and supporters (healers). It's a pretty simple system, no? ---  --- Also, the story kicks back into high gear. I won't spoil anything, except to say that finally, the Testaments, which were alluded to in Episode 1 but completely ignored (other than tangential referral) in episode 2, have returned, and let's face it: Wilhelm is a much more compelling character than, say, a young Albedo. Finally, the wheels which began spinning in episode 1 come full circle. In fact, it seems as if episode 2 could have been skipped entirely, with no loss of continuity. There are numerous nods to Xenogears in this game, and by the way, the gear sequences are actually quite fun (the character battles in episode two were only trumped in boredom...by the gear battles). ---  --- In any case, Xenosaga 3 is a worthy addition to the library. It has flaws (again, it would be nice to have action sequences and movie sequences move more seamlessly, although it's infinitely better than episode 1 or 2), but it's a fun game	pos

I own a black '02 Jetta TDI and am anal about maintenance, including the exterior. I'm always looking for the one wax product that best suits a black car, and have found some that work well. The NXT Gen Tech Wax isn't one of them. One requirement for me is a wax that doesn't leave a white residue to clean up and detail out. The NXT box clearly states that it leaves no white residue, but I'll attest to the fact that it certainly does. In that respect, it's no better than any other wax that leaves a residue. But the worst is the film it left on my car's finish. I waxed my car with NXT, then went on a 150 mi trip to visit relatives. I went in and spent some time with them, then we decided to go eat and take my car. The sun was shining, and as soon as I walked outside and looked at my car, I could immediately see a haze on the hood, top, and trunk lid. I did plenty of polishing after waxing, so it shouldn't have done that. I borrowed a towel and wiped it off, but it returned. When I got back home, I used alchol to remove the NXT, returned the NXT to the store, got some Eagle One Nanowax, rewaxed, and it's gorgeous....with no haze or swirl marks and absolutely no white residue. Good riddance to NXT	neg

 People actually gave this movie 5 stars! Are they for real? If you want a good shoot'em up action movie with lots of hip hop and blunt smoking then this movie is for you. It is fun to watch, but to say it is true to life is like saying cabin boy is politicaly thought provoking. It is a fantasy about how rappers wish there life styles really are. Their are so many Scar Face ripoffs it's offencive, and the conclusion is so weak it looks like they said "Okay, we don't have much film left, we gotta' rap this up real quick. DMX, find religion...and cut." Rent the movie, try to figure out what the hell the jamaican guy is saying, ignore the horrible acting of Naz, then return it.

This keyboard folds out well and I liked the feel of the keys. ---  --- However, the IR connector needs to be in direct connection with the IR port in the PDA.  For the iPaq, this port is at the bottom of the handheld.  The 210 degree arm does not rotate to this area.  In order to have the proper connectivity, you have to turn the handheld on its side.  This then requires another software program download (not freeware that I can find) to rotate your screen to the landscape view, unless you can read sideways without getting a headache. ---  --- Before buying this product, check your handheld to see if your IR port is between 4-8 o'clock - if so, this may be a difficult keyboard to use	neg

This album gives me goosebumps.  I got it because of Eric Dolphy, but there is a lot more to listen to on this album than Eric Dolphy alone (though he's excellent as usual).  The inclusion of Booker Ervin gives the album the perfect texture, as his style in many ways contradicts that of Dolphy. Although the styles are different, they complement each other perfectly.  Mal Waldron is a great composer, and many of his most excellent ideas appear on this album.  The song "Thirteen" is a fine example...you'll just have to listen to it.  Everyone on this album smokes.

Never Be Sick Again offers a major breakthrough in medical thinking regarding health and disease.  I am a biochemist doing medical research at UCLA. A friend gave me this book to read, and I was very skeptical.  After reading it, I couldn't stop thinking about what it was saying.  I even lost sleep thinking about it.  After many weeks, I have come to a conclusion - the author is right.  There is only one disease and there are only two causes of disease - revolutionary!  Once you understand this simple concept, it changes everything.  If your mind is not closed to new ideas, the profound insights in this book will change your life for the better.  It will give you the power to both prevent and reverse almost all disease.  With this new understanding, from now on, I will approach my research in an entirely different way.   --- C.L	pos
Nancy Drew: Last Train To Blue Moon Canyon (13) ---  --- -Before I Begin... --- My review will be spilt up into sections and have a in-depth look at that topic. If you hate reading medium/long reviews or just don't have the patience I would not continue reading, but if you want to learn the most about the product before you buy it you'll continue. ---  --- -Gameplay & Interface --- This is a point-and-click mystery, the arrows and hands are simple and easy to use. They also have made and improvement in the arrows since the last game. The hands manipulate items or add them to your Inventory(Toolbox). When playing the game you also have a panel at the bottom of the screen including a: Inventory(Depicted as a toolbox, which I think should be a backpack instead) a Camera Cell phone and a Journal, Help and a Menu Button (Other games have a Coin Purse when money is used in the game). The Main Menu is pretty simple. However, the loading and saving a game is a little clunky and you can't delete saved games. It also prompts you about your decision; it makes saving/rewriting games take more than one click. For this type of game the interface is perfect, but I'll knock off a star for the irritating save/load page. --- **** ---  --- -Plot --- A fairly used plot in this series, finding treasure. But Her Interactive made this treasure finding story a little more interesting. Jake Hurly, a miner and owner of a custom-built train, falls in love with a young French woman named Camille on the way to finding gold. Camille later dies, Jake possibly finds treasure but he is nowhere to be found and his now "haunted" train is found out in out in the Nevada desert with the engineer dead. Many years later, Lori Girard (Daddy's little fame seeking, rich girl) finds the train and puts it back into shape for a trip to Copper Gorge, Colorado. She invites infamous guests along on the train to find out what happened to Jake Hurley and where his mine is using the clues Jake left on the train. A pretty simple treasure story (This series often uses that story but in different ways) now turned into a intriguing mystery, good work Her Interactive. The game also has some side mysteries like Lori getting kidnapped and someone throwing an emergency brake(Both happen to be publicity stunts). But you find who did those things only minutes after each event happened. What I didn't like was there was not really a culprit because there was no crime committed. The very end is when a crime is attempted after you find out who the culprit is. The Jake Hurley part of the plot was fantastic but the sub-plot(s) weren't very exciting. --- **** ---  --- -Characters --- I loved the characters, but you couldn't really interact with them as much. Lori Girard was one of my favorite characters, I loved watching that dumb blonde trying to get publicity and how she always kept forgetting Nancy's name. Since Lori is the hostess she was probably the main character. Tino Baldcucci is a great character as well. He is a Private Investigator but all he really did to get such fame was being at the right place at the right time. He is as conceited as Lori, you'll probably interact with him a lot more than John Grey. John Grey is the first black male to be in this series, he is the host of Ghost Hunters, a cable show on the verge of cancellation about ghosts. He's a pretty good character but not a leading role unfortunately. Then there is Charleena Purcell a romance novelist introduced in Nancy Drew: Secret Of Shadow Ranch (10), who is nice and very smart. She is in the process of making her book that's on a deadline, who you'll find out used one of Lori's story ideas in her latest book without permission. I like her better now then when she was in ND 10, to bad she has no memory of that game.  And finally there is Frank & Joe Hardy. These teenage brothers work for American Teens Against Crime (ATAC) and who were invited because their dad was friends with Lori's dad. The boys were nice enough to invite Nancy along as well. I personally liked this addition to the game because you get to play as Frank as a short-order cook. They really don't have much to do with the case, they are just a good source of info. I am looking forward to playing as them more in Nancy Drew: Creature Of Kapu Cave (15). I really didn't like how there was not a lot of character interaction in this game. But when you did interact at times it was really fun. That's something to add to ND 16 and beyond. --- **** ---  --- -Setting & Graphics --- I love being on a train, the feel was so exciting. Seeing the scenery pass by in the windows were great. The cars were so detailed and beautiful. I think my favorite place in the train was the Projection Car. Later you stop at Copper Gorge, a little town in Colorado. There was the mysterious crypt and a Museum/Taffy Shop that was cheesy but enjoyable. The crypt was small and there wasn't much to do, but I mean in real life all you do in crypts is mourn. The graphics were great. Very realistic. Its amazing how much the graphics in this series keeps getting better and better. This was probably the most unique setting in the series. I personally love trains, boats and planes so this made me really happy. --- ***** ---  --- -Puzzles/Activities --- The puzzles were fairly easy. I liked how a lot of the puzzles were combined into one to find where Jake's mine is. What was disappointing was the repetition of the puzzles. There were about four or five pipe sets you had to connect which got a little annoying. You also had to retrieve a lot of items like gemstones, tools, duct tape, a pen and other stuff. I don't understand how they made finding the gemstones easier than playing an almost impossible game with Tino to get a simple pen. Some of the puzzles were unique, like Camille's doll sorting puzzle and her favorite dance step, playing "Camptown Races" on the piano, and using metal slugs in a mathematical way to open doors on a scale. But some of these activities needed no skill at all like combinations, a word search, and a two memory games. This game had variety but also repeated some puzzles as well which brought down its score. --- *** ---  --- -Ending --- Once you find out where Jake's Mine your sent off there to get a head start for a "treasure". You'd think that after all the puzzles you went through you would think finding the treasure in the mine would be somewhat harder than everything else. You open the entrance, memorize a couple things, follow some lizards and then use the info you memorized. Not that difficult if you are smart. Then you find the "treasure" and your so called "culprit". You wouldn't know this person is the culprit when he/she finds you in the mine and talks to you, but then he/she loses trust in you and you get caved in. Then you get out(I thought this was fun to do, felt like a roller coaster) to stop the "culprit". I liked the ending and what the treasure was but getting through and out of the mine was relatively easy. Although the culprit was kind of obvious, I liked what the culprit's plan or goal was. Overall it was good ending yet a little easier than I thought it should have been. --- **** ---  --- -Overall --- This was one of the better Nancy Drew games out there. Definitely one to add to your shelf. The flaws in this game don't affect the game that much as they could have if the setting was different. The plot was pretty good and most of the puzzles fit into it. I enjoyed this game a lot after I played it more than two times. I think any game needs to be played more than two times to get the full experience. Some parts of the game are really exciting compared to other parts. The repetition of some of the puzzles isn't too bad. This game is outstanding but there is never going to be the best Nancy Drew game. It really depends on your opinion. ---  --- Add all these up and divide by 6... --- 4 *'s (Gameplay & Interface) --- 4 *'s (Plot) --- 4 *'s (Characters) --- 5 *'s (Setting & Graphics) --- 3 *'s (Puzzles) --- 4 *'s (Ending) --- = 24 Stars Divide By 6 (Categories) = 4 Stars ---  --- Thanks for reading	pos
City of the Dead can't really be called a zombie story.  It's really a cheesy action novel that just happens to have beings called zombies in it.  The zombie aren't really undead like in the Romero movies, but are corpses possessed by demons.   ---  --- I really didn't find any part of the novel scary and it doesn't seem like the author was trying to make it scary.  He seemed to take the route so many Hollywood scary flicks take and just tried to gross out his readers through descriptions of the decayed bodies of the demons.   ---  --- The action is clunky and not very exciting.  His hero's are constantly stopping to argue about things like how Jim's ex-wife raised their son while being hotly pursued by hundreds of demons.  There are too many parts that require suspension of disbelief: a military Humvee could never catch an Explorer SUV, the hero's escape a fire by climbing across a ladder to the neighbor's house with the demons somehow not noticing, they're being chased by dozen's of demon vehicles on the road but second's later after crashing they have somehow lost them.  And I have to ask why Keene included the descriptions of Necrophilia in the novel.   ---  --- In the end City of the Dead reads more like a cheesy Schwarzenegger/Stallone/Norris movie than a horror novel	neg
We got this for our shower. Our son is now 2 and the only thing we've used is the nail clippers. Which I actually really like the shape of them cause they are a lot easier to hold then just the tiny clippers, especially if baby starts to squirm a little. I couldn't even tell you where the rest of it is. The spoon thing and dropper for the medicine is cheap and useless. Any baby medication you buy you'll get a dropper for which works way better. The bulb didn't work well at all, just keep the one you get in the hospital, those work best! And if my little guy was sick he didnt appreciate having to sit still while I tried to take his temp. I recomend a therma scan for that. Just a quick beep in the ear and your good to go. ---  --- So basicly, I would recommend to pass on this item and just get a pair of nail clippers.	neg
I have white everlast boxing shoes & they are very comfortable & I thought these ones were the same. the difference is that the other ones have soft parts in it where the feet move when boxing.  ---  The black ones are uncomfortable in the back side where the division of the shoe is.

Got my Chillow a few months ago and wish I had not waited so long! It is great! My own personal "thermostat" having gone haywire years ago, I have wished for something to help me sleep and be cool. This is it! First, it allows my husband to cuddle up next to me without my pushing him away cause he's so darn warm and I just can't take the extra heat. Second, I have wished for a firm pillow forever!! and have tried many different pillows and a great side benefit of the Chillow is that it makes my pillow really firm. It can be a bit too cold for a minute or two, but it evens out before long. For those of you who have that problem, you might consider doing what I did. I purchased a "Bedsack" quilted & zippered pillow cover. Put the pillow + the Chillow in that and then in a pillowcase and it's just perfect. Might also help the vinyl scent that some of you complain about. I will agree that the Chillow makes my pillow very heavy, but that is my only complaint. And I'm not carrying it around so the weight is really not an issue.  Other than that, I wish I had purchased one of these Chillows long ago. It is a menopausal woman's dream come true!	pos
Budget Travel is a quite a neat colorful magazine and is loaded with exotic far-away landscapes that do what they are designed to and give one a lift into dreamland.

This bench is a must have for outdoor sports. This is the second instabench we have bought as the other one wore out.  It is sturdy and can comfortably fit a coach along with many players on this bench.  The bench itself is a little heavy and bulky but portable enough to throw into the car and go.  The frame is made well.  There were only two issues that I had with the bench.  The first is that the plastic material on the bottom of the seat separated from the top seating material.  Second is the carrying case ripped after a few months of carrying it back and forth to the fields. The top sides ripped along with where the shoulder strap meets the material on the bag.     therefore the rate of 4 stars	pos

I don't know about the people who gave 1 or 2 star reviews but this product is the ONLY thing that saved my hair. I did everything from getting a curly perm to stripping the color. I used coconut oil, frequent trims, keratin treatments and NOTHING worked. My hair still kept breaking and splitting like clockwork. When I used the product, 3 treatments later and it's never been healthier. The product is very oily, so USE SPARINGLY when you use it as a gloss or leave in conditioner! ---  --- P.S. People with healthy, not-so-damaged, and normal hair do not need to use this stuff. Because if you do, you'll get silly comments from a tree-hugger that has nothing to do with the product. This product is only for heavy duty damage! By the way, the ONLY thing good from John Frieda is Frizz-Ease...	pos

When people talk about buddy-buddy films this one gets overlooked.This was a refreshing break from the Eastwood mold,stepping down from the Dirty Harry altar, to switch sides of the law or God(as a preacher).This has a loaded cast, Clint Eastwood, Jeff Bridges(Oscar nominee/robbed)to George Kennedy, as another evil meanie.The oddball teaming of Eastwood and Bridges seals the movie as an enjoyable romp, where cross-dressing,wearing disguises and other stuff plays second-hand to the relationship which is supposed to be mentor/rookie but becomes Laurel/Hardy too often.The story itself wanders off in various directions until it comes home with unexpected sadness, marking the arrival of the versatile Bridges.Like "Collateral," where Cruise lets Jamie Foxx run with the movie, Eastwood generously let Bridges vamp for effect. Such a free-wheelin' script has not hit the screen in a long while.	pos

The Uno's MIDI input did not work with my Roland A-37 MIDI controller keyboard, even after downloading the latest drivers.  Using Cakewalk (Home Studio 4 running on a Compaq V2000 laptop) to record and view the individual MIDI events, I could see that some of the note-off messages had been improperly decoded by the Uno as note C-zero.  This caused those notes to ring indefinitely and caused an ultra-low note to sound... very unpleasant and obviously unusable. ---  --- The MIDI output did work fine driving my Roland Fantom XR and Roland JV-1010 with no problems. ---  --- After reading another Uno & A-37 user's identical problem (on Amazon), I returned the Uno and purchased an Edirol(Roland) UA-25 audio/MIDI interface.

It's a delightful product and I'm pleased with my purchase	pos
This watch is great. It recharges itself, self adjusts with the atomic clock, world time, auto lighting, etc... just to mention a few features. As this is from the G shock series, it is really sturdy and scratch/water/weather/heat/shock resistant! It has both the digital and the analog hand to view the time(whichever is convenient). This synchronizes with the atomic clock(time and the daylight savings) which means you need not adjust the time. Another interesting feature is that if you tilt your hand in the dark towards you then the watch lights up showing you the time! ---  --- There are a few cons. There is no seconds hand on it(but there is a digital second indicator). This watch is slightly heavy and huge. But after a few months you get adjusted to it. You need to go through the manual as there are so many features and you have only four buttons	pos

In this part of the world weather forecasts are either scarce or highly inaccurate.  So far this product has worked great.  Its forecasts are quite accurate so you can plan on taking an umbrella with you in the car if it predicts rain, or if you need to wear your bermudas to enjoy the sunshine.  I had an indoor/outdoor thermometer manufactured by radio shack, and this unit can actually read that outdoor sensor so the addition of the two sensors that come with this unit allowed me to know the temperature indoors and in my patio, garage and the kid's bedrooms	pos
I'm sure there are those who'd wax philosophical over the subject of filters and how one brand is "much better" than another, but for my Canon EF-S 10-22mm on a 20D, I figure Canon would be fairly good at making a filter that they're willing to have branded "Canon." It fits fine, doesn't interfere with the lens hood, looks clear, seems to attenuate that nasty ultra-violet part of the light spectrum and perhaps best of all, protects the front element. What more would one want	pos
This snack is superb in several ways.  First it is very good tasting.  The flavor is very much like a soft peanut butter cookie.

The details are all fine if you don't know the middle east - but are not well researched and inconsistent.  I won't bore you with the list.   ---  --- All the big picture takeaway is that the middle east and big oil are a complicated business with many parties that have a big stake.  Tell us something new.   ---  --- The overall storyline does not have much else going for it - I was expecting more intrigue, a more synthesized story line.  A disappointment. 	neg
My complaints about this stand: --- 1. By far the worst thing about this stand is it leans too far forward.  There's not enough counter-weight so a slight pull on the bike will cause the thing to tip.  If it wasn't for this, I might say, "well I guess it's alright for 79 dollars." --- 2. The clamp isn't strong enough to hold the bike securely.  If you clamp to seat-post for example it will rotate on the seat-post. --- 3. The thing that tightens the clamp is made of plastic.  I'm assuming it will break fairly quickly. --- 4. The rotator is made of plastic - I haven't tried rotating on the seat post where it would put any weight on the rotator, but I doubt it will hold it. --- In my opinion this product should not be sold.  If you just want to clean your bike on a stand, it's fine, but for anything that requires any force like taking the pedals or crank arms off, forget-about-it	neg

The writing was very disjointed in my opinion.  I had to read and re-read many sentences to figure out what the author was trying to say.  It was a struggle to read. No likeable characters.

Laptop Mag can be best described negatively: it's not a really serious computer magazine.  It's more or less like Consumer Guide, which is basically paid advertising.  This means you can't really trust the article here because you don't know if they are not written by unbiased writers.  In the end, I feel this is a waste of money.  Besides, you can get all the info for free on the web, from CNET or ZDNET, anyway	neg
I called Nature Made and inquired about their procedures to test their product for mercury. Their Fish oil is USP tested for purity and potency. There isn't any "mercury-free" fish oil, however, NM contains only .01 mcg / g of mercury. Very low level and certainly not toxic. I'm keeping my bottle of it and will take it confidently.

I used to use Mac's Glass lipgloss before Juicy Tubes were around. Any time the wind blew I had hair stuck to the incredibly sticky gloss which, as you know, is extremely unpleasant and annoying.

I recommend Daiquiri or Berry Bold for the most natural looks. Daiquiri is more of a straightforward shine while Berry Bold gives you that red lipped childlike look we all used to have naturally. You will adore this gloss. I can't live without it	pos

Long before the advent of the written word sacred knowledge was handed down through the generations via the vehicles of ritual, song and dance. I have come to believe that the 'old ways' were in many cases the superior mode of transmission. Mere words could never convey the multi-faceted beauty, wonder and awe that can be expressed in sacred song and dance. This point is made crystal clear in this exquisite production of 'Holo Mai Pele.' ---  --- 'Holo Mai Pele' is an exciting and exotic multi-media production that I found absoultely engrossing. The director seamlessly moves the viewer back and forth between the preparation of the event in the dance studio, the on-stage performance and beautiful film footage of the enchanting Hawaiian landscape. The on-stage performance is also greatly enhanced by a large screen behind the dancers showing footage of volcanic eruptions, lava flows and lush tropical rainforests. All of this is underscored by an intermitent narrative explaining the history of the hula and the mythological tale of the volcano Goddess Pele and her battle with her youngest sister Hi'iaka. The narrative is the perfect compliment to the production and in no way detracts the viewer from the performance. ---  --- This DVD serves as both a wonderful introduction to the novice in Hawaiiana and a much needed and revered document to the initiated providing a performance that attests to the power and immense beauty of the hula and its embodiment of the Hawaiian 'Spirit of Aloha.' Truly a sacred visual document to be treasured.	pos
A recent reviewer noted that she had trouble finding information on skin rashes in this book. I had to post a review responding to her review because this book has tons of information on skin and scalp conditions in the table on pages 404-412, which talks about everything from impetigo to eczema. The information on teething is a bit more meager. I agree that this is something that the author needs to expand upon in the next edition of this book.

It provides tons of information and is reassuring and contains just the right amount of humor to keep you reading at a time in your life when it's hard to find the time or energy to read.	pos

Fable has reached the point where all RPGs dream of going. It's absolutely the pinnacle of the Adventure criteria. The creators put you in the game, they make it fun, and they make it interesting. Fable is the game that absolutely defines the whole light side/dark side thing. Because no other game concentrates on the subtle, small, important details and leisures quite like Fable does. People will learn to adore you, and people will learn to fear you, you have a life, you're not just some dummy on a string being instructed on exactly what to do.  ---  --- You hear that? Fable is life. It's adventure. With a hint of unrealism, just to the point to make you eternally amused to never decease until the fat lady sings.  ---  --- Battle System: 9. It's not guns, it's not shoot'em up blowing their brains out. It's classic swordsplay and acrobatics, blocking, stabbing, leaping, lunging, ducking, dodging, running away, nothing to say except 'die'. Not to mention, you can eat pie. And it's all realistic, hitting someone in the back, the head, the torso, all cause different amounts of damage, there's decapitations if you're lucky. And the game even keeps track of your decapititations, how cool is that? There's archery, shoot someone with and arrow, the further you pull back your arrow, the more damage it does, but the less accurate it is. You see? Realism. Plain, clear and simple, just like the drive-thru guy ordered. ---  --- Leisure and life: 9. Flirt with chicks, flirt with guys. (Eww..) Flirt with chickens. Whatever. Flirt with anything with a face. Get a special haircut, facial hair, tatoos, some chicks find them attractive, some scary. Some may think you're Michael Jackson with a sword and get the heck away from you. Hey, that's life, right? One of the first games ever to allow you to get married to any woman, (or man) and actually have sexual intercourse with them. Yep, you heard me, sex. Don't get cought up on the kinkiness boys, it lasts for 5 seconds when the screen goes blank, it's only for crickets and giggles. Buy a house, rent out your house, live in your house, steal from anyone, kill anyone, picklock doors, fish, dig, kick chickens, abuse your wife, whatever you wanna do, you can probably do it in Fable.  ---  --- Main adventure: 10. Yes, this game is not all just chicken-kicking. There is a plot. Filled with with surprises, cliff-hangers, and ultimate rewards.  ---  --- Gameplay: 4. Quite possibly the only downside to this game. It's TOO EASY. I completed the game naked and didn't die once. There is no way to change your difficulty. This does, however, make the game much more fun as you don't have to reload and just get lucky in order to defeat an enemy. But in all sincerity, you may very well just whiz your way past this game in mere hours if you put your mind to it.  ---  --- But then again, that is why I am thankful for all the bonus material in the game, because the actual game itself can go by pretty fast.  ---  --- It may seem confusing and hard-to-get at first, but all RPGs do, so just stick with it.  --- 	pos
I've always been a fan of Roger Moore's James Bond, but what I've discovered in recent years is that only a couple of his Bond movies were, like, actually good.  "The Spy Who Loved Me" is not one of them.  Oh, sure, it's fun -- almost ALL of the Bond flicks are fun -- but it's basically just a kid's movie, and that's not necessarily a good thing. ---  --- (1)  Stromberg is a lame villain.  Yes, his underwater lair is well-designed, but it's silly.  Not as silly as that ice palace in "Die Another Day," but pretty silly. --- (2)  Barbara Bach is one of the very worst Bond girls.  She's not an ugly woman, to be sure, but she was a terrible actress; she sounds like she's reading -- poorly -- from a cue card in ever single scene she's in. --- (3)  Jaws is a stupid character.  Having metal teeth wouldn't actually make you capable of biting through metal.  The metal you were biting would resist, and you'd end up just tearing up your gums.  I don't expect realism from 007 movies, but I also expect them to not be outright idiotic.  (That said, Jaws is effectively used, and Richard Kiel was excellent in the role.) --- (4)  The disco score is terrible.  TERRIBLE. --- (5)  The plot is nothing more than a rehash of "you Only Live Twice," but on the ocean rather than in space.  Certain elements of the big final shootout are even the same in both movies!  Embarrassing. ---  --- I love Bond, but this is not one of the highlights. ---  --- The DVD is good, with a couple of fine documentaries, but the commentary track grates, because the director and other commentators spend WAY too much time patting themselves on the back for the great job they supposedly did.  Even if that were true, it'd be annoying	neg

We baught a bunch of these fish for our 8 year old.We have a inground pool and thought they would be lots of fun!! Okay we took them out of the package, and had to rearrange the batteries 82 times before it would even respond to the water!!! When we placed it in the pool all it did was go on its side,in circles. Nothing was "realistic" about these things!!!! I should add that it was not just this one, but all of them!!!Do not waste your money or time buying these!!	neg
This book has a volume number - it is one of a series of monographs that have been published.  I am looking volume 231, but since you don't mention the volume number I don't know if this is the volume I'm seeking.  I will go elsewhere for my purchase	neg
This is, without question, the WORST book ever written on one's financial life.  To begin with, it's useless: ZERO information, ZERO new analysis of old information, ZERO advice, ZERO interesting anecdotes.  Additionally, it's rambling--meandering from summaries of old data, to poorly written schmaltzy 'new age' feel-good blathering.  What exactly is this guy's point?   No way to tell.  --- Seriously, this book is SO BAD that all the people who allowed their names to be associated with blurbs on the cover have, in my opinion, lost all remaining credibility.   --- What a waste of my $16 and 4 hours.  --- I want my money and time back.	neg
I would give this kit zero stars if I could. The instructions say that it takes 6-8 weeks for the seeds to sprout. I kept them in moist peat and warm temperatures for over three months after the recommended period of refrigeration.  Not a single seed sprouted. I finally had to throw out the whole kit when mold took over. Complete waste of time and money.  ---  --- But if you're feeling lucky, you should know that most of the seeds in this kit aren't much bigger than pinheads, and they all come packaged together in the same tiny plastic bag. So if you want to have each type of plant growing in a different section of the plastic tray provided in the kit - like that shown on the box cover - you need to separate out each seed under a strong magnifying glass.  And even then you won't be successful, as most of these seeds look just like ground pepper.  I accidentally spilled a few on the floor, and after sweeping them all up I literally couldn't tell them from the other debris in the dustpan.     ---  --- By the way, it takes a minimum of 6-8 years living in ideal growing conditions for any of the plants in this kit to reach the sizes shown on the box cover. These are NOT plants that can simply be put on a windowsill. They need an environment that is not easily provided in the average home - LOTS of very bright light (about 15 hours a day), LOTS of humidity, an acidic growth medium (such as sphagnum moss), and about 80 degrees. And even then, these are VERY slow-growing plants.  ---  --- To keep the humidity level high, you'll need some kind of terrarium, preferably covered to keep the humidity level high. But if you use incandescent bulbs to provide the necessary level of light, the amount of heat they produce can easily raise the temperature to lethal levels. For this reason I recommend a combination of fluorescent bulbs and a moist/dry heating pad at the bottom. Be sure that whatever heating pad you use isn't the type that shuts off automatically after one hour of use.  ---  --- Some warnings...  --- These plants flourish only in a very limited range of environments and nourishment.  The care you would normally give a houseplant will - in all likelihood - kill these plants: ---    NEVER feed them animal protein (like hamburger). The fats in meat aren't digestible and can kill them.  ---    NEVER use tap water to water them. The mineral build-up can kill them so use distilled water only.  ---    NEVER feed them insects that have been killed by insecticides, like RAID. Carnivorous plants should be fed soft-bodies insects like small slugs, ants, termites, etc., rather than hard-shelled insects such as beetles. Well-stocked pet stores will carry dried mealworms, but even these will need to be cut into very small pieces. Just as a baby needs tiny mouthfuls of food, so too do Venus flytraps.  ---    NEVER fertilize them. These are very slow-growing plants and any attempt to force them to grow will kill them. 	neg
This watch is a good size, pretty comfortable, and nice looking for a sport watch. But resetting time or date, or figuring out how to turn off the alarm when you set it by mistake (when you were trying to figure out how to reset the time and date) is super frustrating.

Before purchasing this watch, you should go to a store and take a look. This watch is HUGE. The temperature feature works fine until you wear the watch, then because of your body temp. you have no idea what the temp. is. The barometer feature is displayed in millibars, not something I am acquainted with. I could not get the compass feature to work correctly. ---    It took approx. 3 weeks to be delivered ( free shipping ). I returned the "watch" and purchased a TIMEX, paid for shipping, and it was at my door in 4 days and works perfectly	neg
This is such an good industrial album, that I was sitting and listening to it and all the adjectives that I wanted to use seemed not good enough. However, if I have to put one then it has to be these, brilliant, astounding, stupendous and awesome. This is probably one of the best industrial albums of all time. The first track is good and then it just gets better and better. In fact the first track is not as good as the other ones and could have been replaced with another track. The book-let is ok but the lyrics are missing, but still it is an important release since it showed that inudtrial bands are tallented muisicians and can sing. Minphaser, Life Line, Guna are some of the best made industrial tracks ever with the intricate layers of sounds, bets and samples. The keyboard sounds are constantly amazing and this is an album not to be missed if one likes industrial music	pos
I loved the first Xenosaga. Then, this arrived. Episode 2 isen't a bad game in terms of the story, the intro is absolutely DYNAMITE. Then you get into a battle. Now, if you like tactical stuff, this is a good game for you. But if you're trying to fight your way through a hoard of enemies to get to a save point in record timing, I say save your money. Gone is the amazingly well-done battle system in the first episode. In its place stands a completely out-of-nowhere new way of battling that takes 15 minutes to get rid of a couple of easy enemies( the easy ones in this game have around 2000 Hps). Ridiculous, but that's not all. The enemies have weak "zones" that depend of the height of the attack that you input.The zones are A,B and C, A being the highest. Triangle=C, square=B and Circle=A -SOMETIMES-. See what I mean? It's completely screwed-up and you have to become deeply --- addicted to the game to understand its full potential. And if       that wasn't enough, they changed the voice actors too. Kos-Mos's  --- voice sounds more like an operator than a robot's and Momo sounds like a brat. At least, chaos' voice has improved. I'd prefer playing episode 1 twice than playing this. I just hope Namco comes out with a better sequel, otherwise spend your moey on something else (like Shadow Hearts, for example).    	neg
I've been a subscriber for several years now.  I was trying to decide between maxim and stuff.  I chose maxim because the info is very random and entertaining (i.e. how to do doughnuts in your car, ect.)

I got two of these for the front seats of my Toyota SUV. They are very cute, just like the picture, but the backgrounds are a jungly green, not black, which I expected from the picture. However, the green goes great with my interior, so I'm very pleased with these seat covers	pos
Complete waste of money.  I purchased my copy at Wal-Mart but wanted to warn others before they made the same mistake I did.  The graphics and templates they use on the package to lure you in are nice and tasteful.  The actaul program is SO not like that.  The graphics are down right cheesy, and low budget.  Having only paid $9 for this program, I feel like I was completely ripped off.  I'll for sure be calling the company and asking for a refund. 1 star seems like too many to give this awful item	neg
I bought this product because it has two most important things I am looking for: portable and the splash guard.  My son feels very comfortable with it that he has been using this since last August when we got it.  The parts are all plastic for easy cleaning. The cushion part of the seat and the the splash guard are all one piece, unlike some other potty seat where the splash guard is an attachment.  So that's very easy to clean.  The entire potty can be disembled to be cleaned and sanitized from inside out, no hard to reach spots.  The seat is soft and contoured with oval opening which is best, unlike a lot of potty I found with a circular small opening.  The seat can be put on adult toilet seat which I started training my son after several use to avoid cleaning the bowl.  The only thing I wish is that this product comes in just the seat without the bowl, then that would be even better!  	pos
I discovered this album some years ago as i'm workin' in big music stores i've got the opportunity to listen to so much music....well!! this album is a very difficoult one to find in a record store nowdays, and every time i have it in stock i play it straight away and some customer who listen to it buy it instantly,Blakey and Potato are swingin' so much in those "salsa like" rithms Mobley is -as usual with Art Blakey and K.D.- in such a great shape givin' a wonderfull touch to evry note he plays,basically one of greatest Blue Note of all time!	pos
I was (and still am) a huge fan of "Mr. Show".  It was the only reason I kept my HBO subscription.  It's hard for me to believe that the same talent that created "Mr. Show" produced this weak offering.  Might be the least funny comedy CD I've ever heard.  Virtually all the material in the album has been done before, and much better, by other comedians.  Most of the bits just lay there and die.  Mr. Cross seems to realize this and tries to make up for it by saying f*ck a lot.  Sorry, it just doesn't work.   ---  --- Don't waste you money on this one.  Get the "Mr. Show" DVDs instead and forget this ever existed.   	neg
This is a very nice watch. The pink mother-of-pearl face is lovely to look at and the leather strap is very soft. The date is a little small but the watch is so nice that I didn't even care. The only complaint I have is that Amazon sent me this watch with a dead battery inside. I had to get a new battery on my own, but as soon as I told Amazon, they credited me the $10. That was great, but they should have sent me a watch in working condition. Otherwise, the watch is highly recommended. Even nicer than in the photo	pos
this was the first digital camera i purchased. i am an adventurous person and  wanted something that would stand up to my lifestyle. this camera wasn't it.  ---  --- the good ---  --- *it is compact, which is pretty convenient ---  --- *it has several camera functions that have the potential to work well if you are techno-savvy.  ---  --- the bad ---  --- *after snorkeling with it for 30 minutes, the camera leaked and broke. olympus replaced it, but only after my 2 month stay in costa rica was over.  ---  --- *the functions are unreliable and difficult to use. rarely if ever do i get them to work how i want. the pictures always need touched up afterwards, sometimes seriously. ---  --- *the zoom sucks. don't expect to get those awesome close ups they advertise unless you have some serious patience. ---  --- *the image stabilization is a joke. you need a tripod or surgeons hands to take pictures that aren't blurry.  ---  --- *the user manual left me with a lot of questions	neg

I would have to say that out of the countless bands i have heard over the past few years Into Eternity is one of the best and has one solid album here!! I think they have something a lot of bands do not have and the one cool thing about them is Tim Roth seems to give a real crud about his fans as he does guitar videos on his website to show you how you can break down his guitar riffs and that to me as a guitarist is so helpful (ive learned some of their songs this way) and this shows how he is not afraid to be the nicest guy and actually take that kind of time to be close and original to his fans.you just never see that these days. And the rest of this band has so much talent, Stu can scream like halford growl too and has a high vocal range and it makes them sound interesting. Plus jims drum work, how can anyone say this dude isnt one of the better drummers, he is so tight but can slow it down and tempo change very well. This album plain rocks,  It should be known as these guys were on Gigantour and rocked there too. Be cool if them and annihilator went on tour.  I have become very fond of them and hope they stick around and keep making great albums in a world overflowing with the same ole un-original bands that all sound the same!	pos
This will be short.  It is worth the price of this album just to hear the Branford and Harry Connick Jr. duet Carolina Shout.  That being said, all of the other tracks on this album are excellent. From Jungle Blues to Doug Wamble's solo guitar on Autumn Lamp, with this record you get a pile of blues and at the same time gain an appreciation for Romare Breaden's art.  A must have.  Branford keeps outdoing himself	pos
Being a Starsky and Hutch fan since I was a kid, I was looking forward to playing this. The graphics are "cartoon" horrible and the need for "VR" points becomes annoying after awhile. The bad guys are like something from a Chinese Kung Fu movie, you can shoot at them accurately and it takes all day to kill them...and that's with playing with a PS2 gun (I can't imagine shooting with a controller) which makes you lose the mission because you are down on "VR" points. The dialog gets annoying too and you can't skip hearing it either	neg
I was hoping that "Socermania" would be on the "Extreme Sports Fun" DVD but NO! Instead disney had to put on all of the same cartoons that were released on the "Disney Treasures" this also goes for the other two DVD's Extreme Music and adventure fun, allthough 'Pluto's Blue Note', 'Donald's Dilemma' 'No Sail' 'Old Sequoia' and 'Trailer Horn' are on DVD for the first time but with the new Disney Treasures "Disney Rarities" and "The Chronological Donald volume 2"(which might I add could use a lot of improvment on the restoration) who needs these DVDs, so I suggest not to buy these cheap DVD's and buy the Treasures in spite of the bad restoration	neg
Highly recommended!!!! My wife uses this pack for nursing school.  As you can imagine she carries A LOT OF "STUFF".  This pack makes it a lot lighter on the shoulders than a normal pack would because of the padding in the straps.

Quite disappointing if you are expecting a film true to the book. Hopefully they will remake the movie soon, because the technical capabilities back in 1966 did not do the novel any justice	neg
This is the original version of this film with David Niven, Peter Sellers, Woody Allen and other very familiar faces.  The film is nothing at all like the 2006 version which was very good.  But Ian Fleming intended his 007 to be a non-serious serious agent.  Excellent film and I heartily recommend it.  My 20-something grandson is a 007 fan and he really liked this movie; had to have the DVD after seeing it on TV	pos
OH YEAH! This is the film which set the standard for the women-in-prison genre. The Big Doll House has everything you could possibly need if you are WIP junkie: cat fights (one even takes place in the mud), group showers, sadistic guards, scantically clothed gun toting babes, lesbianism, torture, and Pam Grier. OH YEAH!	pos
This is a great idea for a product! For those of you who don't wash your hair every day, this is a great way to keep it looking and smelling fresh on days you don't wash it.

This soap washed really well, but after I rinsed it off, it felt like my skin had a soapy film over it. It also made my skin feel "stipped". I did not really like this soap and instead recommend Basis facial products instead	neg
I love the look of this watch!  I have enjoyed it for almost two weeks now and it has kept perfect time to date. ---  --- Originally I was attracted to the Seiko SKX173 which I came across first.  However I was concerned that the physical size of the Seiko might be too large for my wrist plus reviews indicated its automatic/mechanical movement might not be as accurate as I wanted.  ---  --- Later I found this Citizen watch which looks virtually identical, yet it is smaller (diameter 38mm vs 43, height 10.5mm vs 13.5), and has a more accurate battery-driven quartz movement. ---  --- It also has a longer warranty (5 years vs 3) which probably indicates that the movement is more likely to be trouble-free than the self-winding Seiko. ---  --- The only negative I have encountered is that it (as well as the Seiko) come with a fairly bulky rubber strap.  While this is more comfortable than I expected, it does tend to interfere somewhat with the drape of the cuff when wearing a long sleeve shirt.	pos
Santa brought this for my 5 year old daughter for Christmas and she loves it.  She takes it in the car with her with her baby doll and belts it in with the seat belt.  One of the things I love about it is it isn't too heavy for her to carry.  She can carry it with her baby doll in it without any trouble.  It is also very sturdy.  She has even sat in it herself and it didn't break.  I would recommend this doll carrier.  It is great for little people who enjoy pretending to be mommy and daddy	pos

My little guy loved this from the start.  This is a versatile toy that lasted many months.  The mat is machine washable, so it became our take along for travel.  The hanging toys are on rings that detach so you can rearrange them for variety and take them anywhere, such as on the car seat or stroller as baby grows.  He's now 2 yrs, and the mat is still a wall hanging in his room!  This was a great investment	pos

Let's just be honest: this film is terrible . . . and not in the way that "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!" is so "terrible" that it's great . . . more like the way "Caddyshack II" is so terrible that the director should forever live in shame . . . ---  --- I was a kid when this film was released. And, while it was not particularly exciting then, it is insanely tedious now. It is a genuine test of patience . . . but with no pay-off what-so-ever. ---  --- Here's some potentially helpful information: ---  --- The slasher film can branch in two directions: supernatural (Friday the 13th II, Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street etc...) and crime/revenge (I Spit on Your Grave, Friday the 13th, TCM, Scream, Urban Legend ect...). This one falls under the latter heading. And while realism can render a more potent effect ("This could really happen!"), this film simply fails to engage the viewer ON ANY LEVEL. ---  --- The goal of a slasher film is two-fold: to horrify and repulse. This does neither!! The "horror" element is non-existent: there is no point in expounding, since there is nothing to examine.  And, if you love gore (and who doesn't?) try another film. The "murders" are barely visible (literally) and so sloppy that they solicit no response other than a yawn. Many of the film's problems are technical: the cinematography is just horrendous. The entirely film is extremely underlit, the colors are needlessly washed-out, and the film stock is grade "F." And this, as you know, is not because the film is over twenty-five years old . . . the problem was always there. ---  --- There is ONE "good" moment in the entire film . . . when the school's "bad boy" has his head lopped-off and it clumsily thunks down the prom-court walk-way. Still, it is more comic-relief than genuine horror. ---  --- The soundtrack could not BE WORSE. I am not referring to the disco tunes (we accept those since this film was made at the end of the disco period), but the tracks made for the film . . . they sound like they were squeaked-out by The Carpenters. So, imagine lots of disco punctuated by lackluster, psuedo-thoughtful ballads (like the final song on the track). Words cannot explain how wildly offensive it is!! ---  --- Did I mention that Leslie Nielson has a meaty role (yes, THAT Leslie Nielsen from Airplane, and Naked Gun)? He plays a tough-minded principal who is tormented by the death of his daughter. I know, it SOUNDS funny, but IT'S NOT!! Trust me!! ---  --- If you dig watching unattractive teenagers "disco the night away," hey, this film is totally for you!! But if you are looking for a decent slasher film from the early middle-period of its reign look elsewhere (like Halloween, Friday the 13th etc...) ---  --- I'd be willing to get all Ed McMahon's Star-Search on you and give this "film" a 1/4 star. But it is an important milestone in the slasher sub-genre (I will not spoil the film and tell you why, though). So if you are a slasher enthusiast or a horror scholar, watch it . . . on picture-in-picture . . . maybe after a few drinks . . . on a day when the cable is out . . . on fast-forward!	neg

These are my single favorite pair of underwear. Not your typical jock but much more comfortable and stylish. I'm in the military so at first I thought "thongs are not for "real men" but after wearing these I found they are, and a lot more guys wear thongs and jocks than you realize. I wear these for every day activivties, sports, work, and leisure. There isn't much fabric so they're great under jeans and my girlfriend thinks there sooo sexy. After wearing them for a while it's like nothing is there because they support you only where you need it.

This book was written in 1982, updated in 1995. It has a whole section on cameras, which isn't useful since most of them are outdated. Doesn't even mention digital cameras. Since it specifically discusses the mechanics of cameras, I found this book to be disappointing.	neg
This is basically a commercial pitch for Dr. Murad's spas and products.

I have returned this item to Amazon; I paid $43.99 when they had it in stock. The audio out on this dock is a stereo mini (1/8") jack, the connection is terrible from then getgo, with low volume, distortion, and noise when the jack is jiggled. ---  --- I would highly recommend the dock they're currently selling at Radio Shack for $29.99.

I have been searching on line and elsewhere for a good camcorder as 1) a replacement for my JVC GR-D70U, which died, and 2) to go online with a video blog.  After much study and evaluation, I chose the Canon ZR800 based on a salesman's recommendation, frustration as to the number of choices which are available, and the presence of an external microphone jack (which was one of my "must-have" options).  After returning home, I read the review by Miamian "New Reviewer", and felt trepidation.  After charging the battery, I tried the camera.  Lo and behold, Miamian is right.  There is an obvious noise when recording, which was not present in my JVC.  Hoping against hope, I played the tape back, and, just as I feared, the tape had a pronounced hiss.  This is not just tape hiss, but a much more pronounced noise, which transfers to the TV when watching.  It rendered the camcorder totally unacceptable. I took the camcorder back, and, like Miamian, ordered the Sony DCH-HC38.  (I know, it doesn't have an external microphone jack, but after all this confusion, I give up!! Why don't they make more cameras with them??) ---  --- The plus signs of this camera are that its menu is much more intuitively laid out, and selection of the desired item does not even require looking at the instruction book.  The joystick selector is so easy to use, to select play, rewind, fast forward, stop, pause in the playback mode,  and is also is used to select various menu items in other modes.  The wide screen viewfinder (LCD) is so nice to use, and easy to see, all others (in 4:3) become passe'. ---  --- I didn't have any chance to evaluate other aspects of the camera, due to the unacceptable noise which demanded rejection of the unit.  The picture looked OK; it did not greatly impress me, however, and the automatic focus appeared to be slow and very noticeable in playback. ---  --- In essence, caveat emptor; especially if you're hard of hearing.  Others watching and listening to the tape will not be	neg

I've found the BEFSX41 (v2.0) to be very problematic.  With firmware version 1.50.18, some distributed network software such as bittorrent will cause the router to reboot itself every 5 minutes, bringing down the entire net.  With the newer firmware version 1.52.10 it fixes this problem, but within a day starts to block or deny connections to our web server (passthru tcp port 80), making the router totally unusable.  Tech support was friendly and helpful, and the only solution they could come up with was to rollback the firmware to 1.50.18 for our websites, and upgrade each time to 1.52.10 whenever we had the need for distributed networking.  So now we upgrade/downgrade the firmware sometimes several times in a single week, and each time we do it brings down our net. ---  --- I've also found that some of the setup options are restrictive compared to other brands.  You cannot assign a static ip to a local computer by specifying its MAC address.  Instead you need to set the ip of the computer manually and this makes things very difficult for our laptops that need static ips.  Also, it appears that you cannot map two different external ports to the same internal port number, even though they map to two different computers.

As an asthmatic with a sulfa allergy, I thought I was limited to naturally dried fruits, which are tasty, but not aesthetically appealing. I'd been looking for some way of getting my fix for dried fruit without running the risk of (at worst) a trip to the emergency room. ---  --- I'd found a number of other freeze-dried fruits, but most of them had sugar added, something I try to avoid. I ordered this product (Orchard blend) with the hope that it would be flavorful. Wow, was it! ---  --- Aside from being good as a quick snack for when my blood sugar starts to drop, it's also fantastic when mixed with plain oatmeal to give it a little something more. ---  --- I'm extremely pleased with this product and I would recommend it to anyone that has been avoiding dried fruits because of a sulfa sensitivity or allergy	pos
I tried this on the day I got it to see how it felt.  The velcro is so strong that when I tried to take it off, the velcro ripped the top layer of the material right off.  I would not advise buying this.  I was dissappointed in the quality of this product.	neg
Bike lock manufacturer Kryptonite recently revealed that tubular cylinder locks -- which this model uses -- can be very easily picked. Kinda defeats the purpose of owning this in the first place.	neg
Just purchased this for my 7 year old son that has cerebral palsey- He only has use of his right hand- this cartridge is perfect- game does not allow mistakes and can play this cartridge with only one hand and not both. Since my son has use of only one hand he has trouble playing the other vsmile games- he's hooked. Is very engaging also where some of the other games fall short	pos

My husband likes watches and is a bit of a geek, so this was the perfect Christmas gift for him.  I was a little bit apprehensive when I recieved it but it works just like it should.

I really can't understand why all the reviewers are going crazy over this record. First off, I bought it without hearing anything by them before, but it had been highly recomended to people who like Tool and Mars Volta by Amazon!! They couln't have been any more wrong. So, why did i personally find this so painfull? --- Well, the whole thing in general is quite painfull. First off, the musicians. The whole band sound like studio musicians. No obvious indivuality or anything new to offer. Then we get to the vocals. The closest thing I can compare them to are Alison Moyet or Anthony and the johnsons. I don't mind Anthony and the Johnsons, but this guys vocals and the music just don't rock. Which is fine. It's ok not to rock! But why the hell, being a Tool fan and Mars volta fan, was I recomended this? It's bland, it's week, and the dubby bass, boring guitar playing/sound... weak vocals.. Actually, forget it. The whole package. It is just lame	neg

I bought this DVD because I was getting sick of the other DVD's that claim to be pilates workouts. This pilates work out is very imformative and very beneficial. I am actually seeing results from this workout after only 3 weeks.  Karen also keeps you motivated to continue.  Not to mention the benefit of getting two 50 minute workouts for the price of one. Beware that you need a resist-a-ring for one of the workouts though, and those can be difficult to find. Great, great workout and I would recommend it to anyone	pos
  I got this as a gift for my neece, she loves it, her parents love it too. She is now three years old, She got it last yr. for Christmas,...I was over to see her yesterday, and it still is like new.

This a great priced cd, but the content is why it is so cheap. It's a true-amateur album. Beethoven Lover is over her/his head. This is the real world, not a fantasy-everyone-likes-every-type-of-music world. Deal with it and agree with me. It isn't so great	neg
The LCD is easier to use than the earlier version that relied on audio clips to switch frequency. You may have to experiment a good deal to find a position where the signal reaches the car radio adequately, like the 1960s rabbit ears tv antennas. Even then, if you are in an are with good FM radio coverage it's going to be hard to find a frequency where this will work. Mostly you can't use this with a cover on and you'll need a car charger if you want to use it for long. The all-in-one modulator and charger that clips to the docking connector is a better solution	neg
one of mikio naruse's last masterpieces was 1960's "when a woman ascends the stairs" - it is also one of only two of the great director's films currently available in any video format in the u.s. but wow, what an introduction it is! this seemingly modest film about a woman on the edge of a precipice, winding her way through dismal back alleys and cheap bars in search of an out is one of the great character pieces in world cinema. crisply shot in black and white widescreen (which is admirably reproduced in this edition), this beautifully directed and acted film is an absolute must for anyone interested in movies. the sadness lies in the knowledge that this kind of film is not made anymore; there's no one talented enough to pull it off nearly as well. class and subtlety are a rare commodity and this film has just the right amount of both. it's perfect, one of the greatest films of all time, one i come back to again and again	pos
Don't be fooled by the enticing 6 megpixels that this camera offers.  I'd been waiting along time to upgrade from my 3 MP Nikon Coolpix SQ as the prices of the higer resolution cameras continued to drop.  What've I've discovered, however, is that there is so much sensor noise in the full resolution 6 MP images from this HP camera that the additional resolution is worthless.  The images look absolutely horrible.  My little Nikon SQ with it's lower resolution produces much sharper pictures at every image size.  Do your homework and make sure that the sensor in the camera you're buying is a good one	neg
This software is completely useless with an explorist gps unit.  I am sending the gps i just purchased, along with this software, back to amazon.  The software will not communicate with the gps, and the company will not respond to any of my support requests, the web page has none of the patches that are supposed to be available, and the live technical support is a complete joke.  After 20 minutes of being on hold, I spoke with a gentleman that barely spoke english, and offered me no help... I knew more about the software than him, and i've only owned it 3 days.  I'll never purchase from Magellan again	neg
Really, folks, spend the money on a gym membership, go outside and play with your dog, play soccer with your kids, or spend time in the afternoons working in the yard or the house after warming up with slow movements and a power walk.  Be reasonable.  Just remain aware of how your body feels, know your limits (i.e. knees, back, elbows) and don't over do it!  It takes time to find your own approach to weight/figure management.  You can do it your own way.  You don't need this thing AT ALL.     ---  --- This product will NOT bring you any satisfaction.  you'll only feel stupid for getting sucked into the infomercial and wasting time when you could've been watching Saturday morning cartoons!!! ---  --- In the infomercial it shows you "all the machines" you have to use at the gym.  Well, there's a reason people use them- becuase their tried and true.  Those machines, well worth the cost of a membership, guide the user in producing precision movements.  THey cost thousands of dollars and are built to be absolutely sturdy.  You're better off using machines at the gym(hey, don't forget the YMCA), varying your cardio between outdoor and indoor exercise, and throwing in consistant measures of Pilates and Yoga, if you want to "change your body." ---  --- This is just another stupid product, we've seen them come and go for years.  It won't be around long, folks... ---  --- Disappoint will occur, and the probabilty that injury will occur is well within the realm of possibility. ---  ---  ---  ---  --- 	neg
I had high hopes for this game, but played it with a friend last night and was appalled at the number of confusing questions and just plain incorrect answers.  For example, one question asks, "Which of these animals is not found exclusively in South America:  (a) chinchilla, (b) sloth, (c) guinea pig, (d) spring buck".  Ruling out zoos, my friend reasoned that since zillions of kids in the US have pet guinea pigs, the answer must be C.  Alas, no; the correct answer is "(d) spring buck" with no explanation.  Did they mean animals in their natural habitat?  We aren't sure.  The question is not clearly written.  Another question asks, "The word `berserk' is derived from:  (a) a Norse god; (b) the German for `crazy life', (c) a tropical plant".  I read this to my friend and said, "None of these is the right answer."  The word `berserk' comes from the Germanic branch of the language tree and means `bear-shirt'.  The game says the correct answer is "a Norse god.  In Norse mythology, the god `Berserker' always fought in a state of frenzy."  There is no such Norse god.  Who wrote these questions?  One of the aspects of trivia games that I enjoy is the prospect of learning something in the process of playing; this game concerns me because I do not know which answers are incorrect.  From a learning standpoint, the badly written questions and poorly researched answers make this a frustrating and intellectually dangerous game. 	neg
Yes, T&C is the oldest continually published magazine in the USA, and it's their 160th anniversary. However, I see little reason to celebrate.  Why? Because I fail to see how it's really improved over the years.  ---  --- Nowadays, this magazine seems to cater far too much to the material lusts of the "nouveau riche". Back in the day when it was a true "high society" magazine, there were rather interesting and educational articles on the arts, literature and culture. It was beautiful and it really gave a person something to aspire to, but now just like so much of the rest of society has mutated into a lot of pretentious materialist wannabees bragging about "bling bling", so has this magazine.   ---  --- There are far too many adverts for so-called "luxury goods" for my tastes, and although they put in a patronizing article about women over age 60 being the new "power" base, they insist on using only THIN 20-something models who probably can't afford the clothes they are modeling! ---  --- Articles wise, they are starting to sound more like Glamour or Cosmo than the erudite publication I used to enjoy buying on the newsstands 20 years ago.  ---  --- Yes, T&C has changed with the times...but these are not good times if that is the case. It's too bad	neg
I have many robot books and this is the best and most informative book of all. It is easy to understand and read; I personally couldn't put it down. I wish it was twice as long while still marinating the high info density... Most authors just babble and every few pages actually tell you something; this is not the case with this book!  ---  --- The programming of a robot is everything... and behavior based programming is the only way to go. This book provides a very good intro into that very subject. The only complaint I have is not about the book but his robot simulation program on is website which is referred to in the text. It seems to be rather slow and over taxing for the PC, but being a Java app it's not that surprising. ---  --- Highly recommended to anyone building robots	pos
I do agree that books containing racist positions should not be given to children without a strong and fully aware comment. But I simply cannot stand to buy a sanitised version of a book without being aware of it. This is called censorship, and it gives me the creeps. As a parent, I have had enough real life opportunities to prove racism wrong to my children. So to realise that somebody has been cheating on me, trying to do my job so that I did not have to explain how society has evolved, how difficult it has been for minorities to be recognised and respected is just a fraud. this review is about the Harper collins Edition , edited by Patricia C. and Frederick L. McKissak, illustrated by Michael Hague	neg

I saw this magazine while browsing a local bookstore and it was a magazine that stood out for some reason...I picked it up and flipped through a few pages and came across an article on Maggie Gyllanhall.  I had recently watched "Secretary," and I liked her, so I bought it.  I'm not much for fashion magazines but this is much different from others like Vogue.  After buying my first Flaunt magazine, I wanted to buy more, but needless to say, the bookstore has not gotten any in for a long time...:(  This magazine will be great for readers who are bored with the same crap churned out in every other magazine out there..	pos

The Digital Rebel is the most amazing camera i've ever owned. My previous camera was a Canon A90 and I loved using all the features on it [great camera!]. I decided recently that maybe I should graduate to a SLR because I was starting to get more creative with my photography. I spent a great deal of time researching cameras and finally decided on the Digital Rebel. After a few months of owning it I still am amazed. The image quality is fantastic, it's quick and responsive, and every day using it I learn a little more. It's the perfect intro SLR camera for me because everything makes sense and it's easy to learn. I've gotten amazing shots that I could never dream of getting with a point and shoot.  ---  --- If you are finding yourself wanting a little more than a point and shoot, go for this camera, you wont be sorry.	pos

I received this a a gift for Valentine's Day this year.  It's a nice bubble bath with lots of foam (rather than big, double bubbles).  It's chock full of natural ingredients and no SLS so it's very gentle- even for little ones.  I do however prefer the Deep Steep in the calming lavender chamomile or energizing rosemary mint. 	pos
I ordered this clock, and then had to send it back two times before it finally arrived undamaged (actually, minimally damaged). The first two times the glass was cracked and broken. By the third time, all that was the matter was minor dent marks in the metal frame where the packaging must have pressed down on it (this is only noticeable in certain light angles). The shipping problems weren't the manufacturers fault though, as Amazon did the packing and shipping. It'd be nice if they maybe put a big "Don't stack things on top of this box" sticker or something on the box so that it didn't get damaged. Or, bubble wrap, remember that stuff?! Those airbags just ain't cuttin' it.  --- On the clock itself, I love it. I kept it despite the minor denting b/c it has been discontinued by the manufacturer, and it's the largest atomic clock I could find that didn't have some ugly antique-ish design. The second hand actually ticks, instead of fluidly moving, which is a nice touch. It was easy to set up, and it's big and easy to read. It reminds of the clocks all over my high school (in a good way). All in all, very happy with the actual clock, very dissatisfied w/ Amazon's shipping and packing of it	pos
I have been canvasing the internet for some type of guard to cover the hearth in our family room.  I have read countless reviews of the "double faced tape foam pads" that come off right away with little effort. --- This product attached exactly as described.  I had the unit installed as well as the pads measured, cut and installed in 10 minutes.  The taupe color is very discrete on our cream, red & black brick fireplace.  I can't see how my three little ones would ever get this off even if they tried.  Great product and gives me the feeling of comfort that if someone falls and hits there head that the chance of sticthes has been greatly reduced.  An absolute must for your hearth.	pos
I wore these shoes when I worked on my feet all day and they really helped with pain in my feet, ankles, knees and hips. I could really feel the difference from my other work shoes and the "teeth" in the shoes on the soles of my feet really felt good. Being diabetic, I am very concerned about circulation and I believe this was a good purchase. A little expensive, but well worth it in the end. I plan on buying more	pos
The knots in my back - my "spots" never really go away due to posture and my work in front of the computer.  One day I asked a coworker what the odd green thing by his desk was.  He explained the concept, I tried it for about two seconds and immediately knew this was something special.   The leverage is perfect for zeroing in on your back knots and applying STRONG pressure to them - like having a strong friend digging their knuckle in and holding it there.  I bought one the next day.  You don't need an expensive vibrating massage wand that has all sorts of silly features - just this simple stick that can pinpoint and dissolve all your stress spots. 	pos
This is a great little desktop charger pocket for the Motorala V60 and an additional battery.  However, it seems expensive for what you get, not to mention the fact that what the text doesn't tell you is that you need an *additional* (expensive?) serial cable/adapter in order to use it with your regular charger cable.  Unless you want to charge an additional battery at the same time, save money and just get the nifty travel charger with the folding plug for the bargain price...and just place the phone down on your desk or tabletop while it charges	pos
I hate to use this word, but this product truly is ORGASMIC. It comes out perfect, cup after cup, having a creamy yet zingy taste. The first time I tried it was at Einstein Bros. Bagels (the use the concentrate themselves to create "their" Chai Tea Latte). When I first tried this, I exclaimed to myself, "WOW!!!!". Any person I have ever served this to was willing to vouch that their tastebuds were in sheer ecstasy. ---   ---  Mr. Oregon Chai Tea Latte Concentrate, THANK YOU	pos
I used one of these water-blades at a school car wash and was sold. The parent that brought the water-blade said he had received it as a gift and was really happy with it, used it a lot. It does not remove all the water, you still have some small amounts that will require a towel, but this is a small amount. We used it on 20-30 cars at the car wash to pre-dry the cars before the kids finished the job and it worked great! Purchased one for myself, so I guess that's a good recommendation	pos

These gloves are extremely high quality. They do a great job of protecting your hands, and for most exercises, they do help your grip. The have the best wrist support of any glove I've used to date. However, as mentioned: if you have small hands, the added padding/rubber in the gloves will decrease the circumference of your grip in general. This is a problem for exercises like deadlifts, chin ups, etc. Also, the material inside is a bit like felt. When your hands are sweaty, these gloves basically adhere to your hand on the inside and it usually takes me 1-2 minutes to get them off. They may just need to be broken in more, but I've used them for 3 weeks thus far. 	pos
I have a small head and this was way too tight for me.  It pulled my hair and left me with a headache.  Plus it has a strong chemical smell that didn't go away after wearing in the pool. I tried it 3 times, thinking it might get better, but gave up and threw away. Spend a little more and get the fabric or silcon style instead	neg
The product smells really good, is very affordable and helps maintain my hair style all day. I highly recommend trying it. I will make it part of my daily hairdress (grooming) for life!	pos
Be warned that the business card side is deep enough to hold 50 cards.  I bought this wallet only to hold a few credit cards, my ID and some cash.  Hence, there is a lot of wasted space in my wallet.  From the picture, it looks as though the business card side is just a slot. Whereas, in reality, it is actually a pouch (like most of the other card holders).  Other drawbacks are that there is some filler underneath the leather to make it look smoother (which takes up quite a bit of space), the leather itself is very low quality, and the wallet does not close well even without anything in it.  Furthermore, on the inside of the wallet there is a large white tag stating that it was Made in China.  I mean, China is great and all but if you're on a date and you say "Hey, let me pay for this," and you pull out your credit card and a large white tag protrudes with it saying Made in China, well, you are pretty much a schmuck (I cut mine out with a pair of scissors, but there are still some remnants).  So if you like being low class, by all means, buy this wallet.  I personally don't care about my wallet very much so I am keeping it and going to use it, but I almost returned it.  It is most definitely a solid 2 stars.  Hope this helps	neg
I have ordered this coat 2 times and returned both coats.  I'm very disappointed.  This is supposed to be a reversible coat.  However, the hem of the black side is too long. Consequently it hangs below the hem of the bronze side when reversed.  And, it does not look good at all.  The company needs to revise this pattern	neg
One of the Spotlight Reviewers says that by combining two great characters--Sunny Randall and Jesse Stone--Robert B. Parker has doubled our fun. ---  --- Quite the reverse. ---  --- He has cut it in half. ---  --- The characterizations of Sunny and Jesse are enormously feeble; and the the rest of the characters are no great shakes, either. ---  --- Sunny's Irish Mafia uncle is a cardboard cutout.  Suitcase Simpson has three funny lines and is heard from no more.  The villains--Buddy, Erin, Missy, Gerard, Moon--are little more than vague names and stereotyping.  Spike is relegated to a scene and a half. ---  --- Oddly, the only interesting character is a very minor one: Eddie.  But he only stays around for 10 minutes ---  --- Even the plot is tissue-thin. ---  --- The love-story is lame; the sex-scenes boring. ---  --- Worst of all, who should appear but (Christ!) Susan Silverman, from the Spenser series: one of the dampest and most wooden and least interesting characters in fiction. ---  --- As with "Cold Service" and some others, Parker is just coasting with this one. ---  --- He is capable of far better. --- 	neg
This game was given to our 3 year old as a gift and he loves it.  His little sister, who is two, also loves this game.  This game really helps to develop a childs ability to concentrate on visual cues.  It is basically a matching game combined with a puzzle concept.  There are no complex rules to learn, so within minutes of opening the box any child can begin to play and enjoy this game.  As each match is made the child receives immediate reward and motivation to find a new match.  Best of all is that this is a simple game with no buzzers or bells and is best played with the TV turned off	pos
LIVING IN FLORIDA I BOUGHT TWO OF THESE EVERLIGHT FLASHLIGHTS.  --- THE PARTY THAT SAID THERE WAS ENOUGH CHARGE DURING SHIPPINS IS A LITTLE SHAKING IN THE HEAD.

AFTER THAT IF YOU DON'T CONTINUE TO SHAKE IT DIES OUT VERY RAPIDLY. --- THIS LIGHT MAY POSSIBLY COME IN HANDY DURING A HURRICANE POWER FAILURE BUT THERE ARE OTHER LED FLASHLIGHTS WITH BATTERIES THAT ARE SUPERIOR TO THIS ONE.

This one is for you.  But honestly now, the guy doesn't write--beautiful voice--but songwriting is a major appeal.  So  guess a solo garfunkel is a lot like a step above Justin Timberlake.  Ok, there are definitely highlihgts like a Heart in Newyork, (what a) wonderful world, but generally this a very casual compilation, good for a couple listens.  in general, Art Garfunkel isn't really good for more than that.  Check out him witht Paul Simon, that is amazing stuff, but this is kinda boring.  I might have a bit more respect if he wrote the songs--but even though there are good songwriters writing for him, the songs are still sub-par	neg
But it does have some faults. I have had it for some time now, I got it for my 11th birthday. I have reviewed the cingular version too, even though mines verizon. ---  --- FAULTS: --- Very short battery life - I have to charge it almost every day! --- Camera - The picture you take can't move or it comes out all messed up. ---  --- GOOD PARTS: --- Big screen - Easy to read! --- Recording videos - Even though you get 15 seconds, I still use that to make funny videos with my friends. --- It's style - I love the color and style! My friends are all jealous. ---  --- Overall, I think it's a great phone	pos
Having looked extensively for a casual parka that works well with jeans I finally found this one. I ordered on-line, and then received a phone call from the company supplying this product through Amazon, verifying that the size I ordered was correct.  The person I spoke with was very friendly and helpful.  She helped me decide that I needed a larger size and I'm very glad because when the parka arrived it was the perfect size.  I love all the pockets.  It has just enough lining to be warm yet comfortable.  And best of all it looks great with jeans and other casual clothing. The outer shell is also very soft.  	pos

We love popcorn as an occasional treat at night, but don't like the salt and fat that usually comes with most microwave popcorn.  We had been using a microwave popper to make our own plain popcorn, but with no oil whatsoever it lacked a little something.

Although I have only read a few specific subjects in this book, I am only giving it 1 start because the information in the section on hyperemesis is extremely inaccurate and perpetuates outdated myths about this very serious and life-threatening disease. For anyone who has had hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), reading that a spa day would be beneficial, is not only absurd, but also insulting. Many women with HG cannot get to another room of the house without help, much less drive a car to a spa! HG is a disease and not a psychological condition. Women cannot stop the disease at will. This myth has resulted in a century of poor and sometimes abusive treatment of these afflicted women, causing excessive and unnecessary stress and misery, not to mention preventable complications during pregnancy and in their resulting children. Some women have life-long effects. (...	neg
First of all I am a huge Beatles nut so any movie made by them or about them i love. With that out of the way I can say that this was a very good movie.  --- For those expecting a movie like A Hard Days Night, it is nothing like that. This movie is about John Lennon's friend who was the bass player for the Beatles at the begginging  of their carrear. it shows how he lost his interst for music and fell in love wiht a German lady. I wont tell u the ending, but this is a true story. --- All in all i thought this was a great movie. You should defiently buy it	pos

HA!  Great movie, plot, performances and insights!  Gotta see this one, at least once, for experiencing a truly under-rated masterpiece.  My main reason for writing is the inane comments here and fear with reality that pervades our society.  Those who can't, don't or won't appreciate (at least) the marvelous, insightful messages here are possibly the very ones that assure nothing will ever change much .  Scary to shed light on bare essence of humanity's inhumanity and its inability to rise above the systematic base obsessions of power, control and coveting; whether rationalized with all the reasons that endorse continuing to man's lower instincts or from fear of looking beyond the security of ignorance.  It is amazing that the natural order of things may be better balanced and have a wisdom beyond anything man may attain, as he seeks to control nature and fellow man while failing miserably at controlling himself, even with all his knowledge and tech, to a point equal or beyond the inherent natural wisdom of (so called)lower species.   --- Have some fun and enjoy this movie.  It is powerful and as perfect as it gets in addressing very intriguing human societal conundrums while offering quality performances from a great cast on numerous levels.  As a species, we have come so far and grown so little! This movie will make you (oh-oh) think and feel about subliminal and covert topics o human nature that are rarely put well in words or illustrated in today's world.	pos

I purchased this product to replace a really good 802.11g unit from Linksys, hoping to set up a Gigabit home network with ethernet storage.  I initially considered the WRT300N model, but the reviews were mediocre.  So I went instead for this newer model, hoping that Linksys has fixed the bugs and addressed the problems identified with the WRT300N model.  I am sorry to say that all the bad reviews on the WRT300N also apply to this model.  I am returning it after 5 hours of use. ---  --- On my home network set up with my current Linksys 802.11g unit, I am able to stream 4 different movies to four different laptops at the same time throughout the house, and all four movies display flawlessly.  On this new unit optimized for streaming video, I was not able to stream a movie to a single laptop sitting close to the wireless unit.  The movie had interruptions every 4-5 seconds.  This was worse as the laptop was positioned further from the wireless unit.  Performance was equally bad with laptops equiped with G cards and N cards.  And performance degraded as I tried to stream to multiple laptops at the same time. ---  --- The speed of the links to my laptops equiped with N cards was 144 Mb/s, and was 54 Mb/s on those equiped with G cards.  So the connection seemed fast enough.  It might be that by tweaking the wireless unit in some way, it might be able to perform as I expect.  But I don't have time to waste on such tweaking, and given that my 802.11g unit performed flawlessly out of the box, there is no point to "upgrade" to this new flawed model.  I'll delay my plans for a gigabit home network until the technology has matured and the bugs have been worked out	neg
This game is very good. They only add in a coople people to the stoy line but that is cool. The game folows the movies well. You can even blow up buildings. The only thing i dislike about this game is that is a littel repeditave. Lastly, you can get in high speed cases with the cops	pos
I love this watch. It's perfect for swim workouts and aquathlon races -- takes splits, can do intervals, etc. I use a different product with a heartrate monitor for my runs, but can't use it for my swims (since heartrate monitors can't transmit under water, and also, the unit itself is not waterproof). This Timex has an audible chime under water, and it's easy to set the various functions. It stores your workout splits so you can recall them later when logging your workout. I also love the 3 alarms - my schedule is different every day, so I use the alarms to remind me when to leave work for school, when to leave to pick up my son, etc. I had lost my first watch (same model), but never found another watch that had all the features I wanted for a reasonable price. This is my second one!	pos

I enjoy all the features of this item. ---  --- The main compartment that hold the camera is soft and secure. You can open it without worrying about your camera falling off. ---  --- The back compartment is roomy enough for all the basic gear. The slot for memory cards 1-4 (depends on the card type), batteries (roomy for four AA), and cables can fit in it. ---  --- The shoulder strap is basic and looks flimsy. It's not long enough to hold comfortable diagonally but on the side is good. The belt loop is very secure and can fit on belt three inch in width. ---  --- It can even handle the worst environment ever. Hot, dry climate with sandstorms and occasional accidental drops. It has protected my dig. camera very well	pos
Half-Life made its debut in 1998, and it shocked the entire world. Half-Life at the time featured stunning graphics, gameplay, and sound. It was simply one of those games that had to be in every gamers hands, and still to this date Half-Life is a game that every action-game developing company carefully needs to study in order for their games to be a success. Shortly after the release and once the gasp from the world has ended, two game developers joined together to create a game that not gasped the world again, but made it scream. ---  --- The game pits terrorists and counter-terrorists in a fast-paced sort of "S.W.A.T." type of tactical firefighting gameplay. Matches can consist of one of two types of game types. The first and probably the most popular type is bomb defusal. In both of the game types, you can win by either eliminating the opposing team or following the objective. In bomb defusal a random player on the team will receive the bomb each round. The player can plant the bomb in one of two bomb spots or simply drop the bomb for another teammate to pick it up and use it. Once the bomb is planted the counter-terrorists must defuse it regardless if the terrorists have been eliminated. The counter-terrorists usually have about thirty-five seconds to defuse the bomb and win the round. The second type of gameplay is hostage rescue. The terrorists must protect four hostages in an area of the map from the counter-terrorists rescuing them and taking them to their base. If the hostages are killed by the terrorists or counter-terrorists, nothing will happen except that now the counter-terrorists must completely kill the terrorists to gain victory in the round. At the start of each round all players have a few seconds to quickly buy weapons with the money they have achieved from past rounds by victories. Both teams have a significant difference in the arsenal of weapons you can choose from, but neither really focuses on a specific time of gun style. All of the weapons in the game are one-hundred percent realistic and deadly as in reality. This is an element that makes Counter-Strike such a superior game.  ---  --- Counter-Strike is without argument the most popular online action game in the world. An entire culture has formed around it. So what makes it such an extremely addictive and popular game? It is purely because of the fantastically well-crafted gameplay and not the graphics, or the game would not be as popular as it is. Players around the world will give you many "deep" reasons why it is such a great game. But one without argument stands out. It is simply the fact that versus other games, it is "difficult" to make a kill in the game. What makes the game so addicting is the pleasure of killing someone after a long thirty second gunfight or a quick shot to the head, knowing that the dead player is now experiencing some form of anger as he waits out the rest of the round. Another element is how realistic the guns feel in the game. Regardless if they are fake and the shooting has been totally simulated, it has been superiorly well done. And definitely once a new player to the game has gained enough experience to achieve kills at least periodically, a feeling of "power" will be experienced when holding an AK-47 or an M4. The game is quite punishing to new players, and a total hapzard to players who have never played first-person shooters or video games at all. But regardless the stress you feel at first, there is absolutely no reason to put down the game because of the entry-difficulty, as it is almost guaranteed you will get better in the game. ---  --- There are over ten maps in the game, and each one has been done as a masterpiece. All of the maps wildly differ from each other in the feel of action and even the environment. The most popular of all the maps, de_dust2 that has been created by DaveJ, is still commonly referenced in many gaming parodies, magazines, shows, etc. Due to its style and simplicity, it is a godly-designed map and arguably the most popular map in first-person shooter history. One thing that helps to fight a player of being bored of the game is simply the maps. Since each map has been superbly designed, a player could easily switch to another one after being bored and continue on with play, and with a different feel. The game also has many public map editors which 3rd parties can use to create custom maps. fy_iceworld and awp_map are some very popular maps that have been created by amateur designers. This makes Counter-Strike a game with an almost "infinite" value sort of feel.  ---  --- The sound in Counter-Strike is absolutely insanely-realistic. The first time a player plays or even watches another player play the game, the person will definitely without a doubt notice the clear sounds of AK-47 fire or pistol fire. Not much is known why the guns sound so realistic, and the player's best guess is that the designers have actually recorded live gunfire of the weapons. The sound of the weapons combined with the look and feel; end up making the player totally immersed into the game and with a feeling of "power". This sort of thing is extremely rare in video game.  ---  --- At the time Counter-Strike had simply jaw-dropping graphics. Created all from the Half-Life engine, players were amazed at the lighting effects and how clear the textures were. At the present, the game doesn't hold the same, but it is what in the past has mattered. Half-Life was one of the first games in history to have some slightly complex and dynamic physics. The bouncing of a flashbang or a player being blown away was also something at the time to look at. Games before the release of Half-Life hardly had any sort of physics, and if they did, it would be something very basic.  ---  --- Counter-Strike is a game that without argument should be on any player's hard drive. There are still even thousands of players that since from the release of the game back at 1998, still actually play the game without losing an ounce of boredom. Counter-Strike will forever be played, and is the heart of all action games from the past, present, and the future.	pos

I'm a big believer in reading Amazon reviews -- customers rarely lead me astray!  But this chair (which we bought specifically because of everyone's praise) is miserable!  I don't understand why it got such high marks...  The tray is way too huge for easy cleaning and it (rather than the chair) has a "leg separator," which means you can't set it down anywhere without it tipping all over the place.  We've also found that the tray can be EXTREMELY difficult to hook onto the chair, and doesn't push in towards the baby's belly far enough.  In addition, the clips that attach the harness are filled with grooves and can't be cleaned well, so they're beyond gross, just after a few feedings.  Of all the baby things we wish we'd never bought, this is number one on the list...  I can't help feeling that if we'd just closed our eyes and pointed at random to a high chair, we would have done better than this thing...  The only reason it gets ONE star is because I appreciate the non-obnoxious print -- it's nice to not have something on display with clowns or fish or teddy bears or bright colors.  ;	neg
We bought this for our son for Christmas this year based on glowing reviews. What a disappointment! The "musical instruments" are basically glorified rattles that all sound basically the same, the song the drum plays is tinny, scratchy, and short, and nothing seems very well made.

This fun fragrance comes across to me as soft and slightly sweet, with a feel that's both young and a bit sexy.  The scent is quite pretty, with a bit of floral, and the lightness of it makes it a perfect everyday scent (although it works well for romance, too!).  As mentioned above, the scent does have a youthful, fresh feel to it, and although I've heard some say that the fragrance is best for teens, I'm almost 40, and I enjoy it on days that I'm looking for something lighthearted and fun (granted, I probably wouldn't wear it everyday).  Lucky You comes in a cute pink bottle with a unique rubber stopper, and it has good staying power, although the scent grows more subtle over time.  Recommended for women of all ages who are young at heart	pos

Really does not get the film noir credit it deserves (probably from its title with the uninformed film watcher expecting this to be a feature starring Dinah Shore or other 1940's musical starlet.) Some very satisfying twists of the old plot make this memorable and high on the repeat viewings scale.  Gene Tierney is wonderfully mercurial - sometimes hot-hot-hot and other times just plain icy cold. This was her only Oscar nominated film and you can see why she was picked here.  See Gene in this and in "Laura" and you will see two of the best 1944 leading actress film perfomances	pos

 ---        Tried and true might well describe the products offered by Caswell-Massey as generations have relied upon them for both quality and efficacy.  Established in 1752, it's America's oldest Chemist and Perfumer.  My grandmother enjoyed their products, and I do, too. ---  ---  Their Almond & Aloe Liquid Soap is a boon because it not only cleanses well but moisturizes as it does so.  Far too many soaps leave skin feeling dry and itchy. ---  ---  Almond, as we  know, has a lovely distinctive fragrance as well as skin softening properties.  Combine it with aloe which contains healing properties, and you have a uniquely beneficial cleanser. ---  ---  Other ingredients include Vitamins A and D for nourishment.  This soap is particularly useful for those who wash their hands frequently during the day and for those with normal to dry or sensitive skin. ---  ---  Other items in Caswell-Massey's Almond & Aloe line include Body Balm, Bath Seltzer, Cold Cream Soap, Hand Cream, Hand & Body Emulsion, and Almond Body Splash	pos

This was my first time to ever attempt using a software program to file my taxes. TurboTax sounded easy enough. And it was pretty easy at first. The software interviewed me in an efficent manner and saved all of my information. But the final tax forms I needed to file with were not included on the CD-ROM package. TurboTax instructed me to get them by using "one-click update." Well after I update and attempt to restart the software, TurboTax refuses to come up at all.

Every once in a while I like to pick up a book that is outside the realm of usual reading, and look for a surprise, or spark to keep the fires of imagination from dying out - it is with this mindset I picked up "Wouldn't Take Nothing for My Journey Now."

Ehh... ---  --- Ms. Angelou may not take anything for her journey, but based on the cover price she will take $17.00 to tell you a bit about it, and even this may not even seem like that bad a deal were it not for the fact that either her journey was bland, her insights wanting or her conclusions misguided - whatever the cause, this book is dreadful.  If you are looking for the usual meaningless new age spiritual gobble-gook; i.e., about boundaries, respect, finding ones direction, learning what it means to be a women, etc. then this journey is for you - but if you see this nonsense as the nonsense it is, you will be best served my buckling up your shoes and journeying elsewhere	neg

Cast:  Denzel Washington, John Goodman, Donald Sutherland, Embeth Davidtz, James Gandolfini, Elias Koteas, Gabriel Casseus, Michael J. Pagan. --- Running Time:  123 minutes --- Rated R for violence and language. ---  --- "Fallen" starts with convicted serial killer Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas) being executed in the gas chamber as the man who brought him to justice Detective Jon Hobbes (Denzel Washington) looks on. Hobbes thinks that this is the end but soon has to rethink as he receives a phone call which tells him to check a house out where he finds a dead man named Muscovich (Glen Witko) in a bathtub having been poisoned, the same way Reese used to kill his victims. At first Hobbes fears a copy cat killer but during the course of his investigation the name Robert Milano comes up, a decorated cop who apparently committed suicide. Hobbes speaks with his daughter Gretta (Embeth Davidtz) who at first is reluctant to speak with him. Things become even stranger when the man who killed Muscovich, Charles (Robert Joy) is found dead in exactly the same way having been poisoned again. Eventually Gretta tells Hobbes the truth, he is in fact dealing with an ancient demon called Azazel who has the power to jump form body to body at will by mere psychical touch. The demon Azazel seems to be taunting Hobbes, ruining his life & career, setting him up for murder & getting to his friends & family. Hobbes must find a way to destroy the ancient demon before it destroys him & everyone he cares about. ---  --- Charismatic leading man Denzel Washington is suitably cast as the protagonist and proves to have range, while John Goodman is okay but greatly underused while the same applies to James Gandalfini who plays almost the exact same character. Donald Sutherland doesn't prove to have any range, doing the usual gruff routine that he does in nearly all of his movies. Embeth Davidtz is a talented and totally under-rated actress. She delivers a good performance and shows great potential for the future.  The directing and camera work in this movie was superb. It was done in such a way where you can see Azazel's spirit go from person to person simply by following the camera up and down the crowd and watching the subtle touches one makes in a normal walk about town.  Although this film does require your full attention, it does not go unrewarded and you are not left at the end scratching your head wondering what had happened for the past two hours.  "Fallen" is an intelligently written, supremely efficiently executed, and one of the most unheralded, unnoticed thrillers of the late part of the decade.  One of the better of its kind	pos

This is a complete joke.  The only cities that are in the program for U.S. states are major metro areas. If you have a handheld (either regular or mobile phone) you more than likely also have WiFi or GPRS internet connection.  And if you are in a major metro area, with a WiFi connection, why would you need a program for maps?  Just go to Yahoo Maps or Mapquest.  If you don't have a WiFi, then just buy a paper map...it will do the same thing (maybe even more!) than this program. ---  --- The only possible way this program could be useful is if you already have a handheld GPS receiver AND you never find yourself outside major metropolitan cities.  I have a GPS receiver for my laptop (USB) which I though could connect to my handheld and it won't...so my advice is to buy an entire package (software and handheld-specific GPS receiver). ---  --- Can't believe Microsoft put its name on this junk	neg
Perhaps if I hadn't already had a different type of bunting, I wouldn't be so disappointed with this one. My sister loaned me her Eddie Bauer bunting when my son was born. She will be having her next baby any week now, so I had to return it to her which meant I had to buy a new one. I saw nothing but great reviews on this product, so I picked one up. ---  --- First of all, I followed the washing instructions, washing it separately on delicate and drying it on low, and it ripped at the one seam!! Based on that alone, I will be returning it. ---  --- Aside from that, having used a bunting with a different design, I am not thrilled with this one. Part of the point of using a bunting is so that when you're in a car where you have heat, you can open up the bunting on a longer drive so baby doesn't overheat. This bunting zips down both sides to the bottom (by the way, zipping/unzipping is tricky with a baby kicking around; the zipper gets stuck in the material a lot), rather than down the middle front (that style zipper was NEVER a problem). Then you have this thick cover at baby's feet and nowhere to go with it, as the bottom of the carseat is up against the back seat of the car! So you either have to rig it so it is up the back of the seat and tucked under the headrest, or you have to leave it on baby's legs. ---  --- Also, the top of this bunting does fold over so that baby's face isn't covered unless you want it to be, BUT...my 5-month old has no problem picking it up and pulling it up over his own face. He did it this morning on the way to daycare. This bunting is too thick for me to feel comfortable with him doing that. And I can't be reaching in the back seat to pull it down off his face! ---  --- There is no disputing that the concept of a bunting is great, and that this particular bunting is toasty warm. It is wonderful being able to put the baby in his carseat and strap him in safely w/out a snowsuit being in the way, or having to bundle him up before going out and unbundle him every time you get to your destination. But I don't think the design of the Urban Bundle-Me is great and I actually think this bunting is TOO warm (even with the bunting open on a long car ride the other day, my son's back was all sweaty when we took him out of the carseat). After calling several stores and looking at all my options at Babies 'R' Us, I ended up ordering a new Eddie Bauer All-Season Bunting from Target.com (which cost less than $20 including shipping). I can't wait till it gets here. I will be returning the $60 Urban Bundle-Me as soon as I can	neg
There are no doubt a few nuggets of wisdom in this book, but they are buried too deeply in bureaucratic gibberish to be worth digging up.  This book has no bibliography, no index, mediocre footnotes, no serious useful conclusions or strategic summary, and a disturbing combination of American-centrism (on page 71: "In the Asian continent....(t)he first driver will be the future U.S. role in Asia.") with a lack of intelligent presentation.  There are exactly three figures and seven tables in this 336 page book, when there should have been at least 30 tables and figures illustrating specific sources of conflict in relation to specific countries.  The World Conflict and Human Rights Map (8 pages of graphics and 8 pages of fine print) out of Leiden University does vastly more to inform than does this book.  This book should never, ever have been published in its present form--I venture to say that if it were condensed to 150 pages and properly edited, with graphics and good synthesis, it might be worthy of a second look.  Time is the most precious commodity in the world--RAND managers and editors need to get serious about how they present possibly useful information to experts who want to know what RAND thinks, but cannot spare the time to get past cumbersome undisiplined--even lazy--preparations.  The topic of this book is extremely important--those who would invest their scarce time and money in doing research in this area deserve better from those who put together this book	neg

If I could give it negitive stars I would! We bought two of these gates due to a couple of very wide openings that needed to be secured. These gates are horrible and very poorly designed. Every time someone tries to open the gate, it sags and pulls the wood dowels out of the frame and it completely falls apart! We have older children that have had to resort to crawling over it to get into the living room just to avoid its eminent collapse. And often it collapses anyway. Now my 11 month old son has figured out that if he shakes the gate at the joint he can pull it completely apart and crawl right through. Now we have to purchase new gates that actually work to replace these.	neg

Great invention to those who don't want to be attached to an IPOD, and like an updated version of a "juke box". Easy to use, load, unfortunately however, it requires an receiving unit to broadcast the sound	pos
My daughter is 7 years old and can do this by herself with no problems.  It came with three framed art works.  She crunched them and then hung them up in her room.  Very cute!  Fun bright colors and very easy to use.  One of the things I liked best about this craft is that it wasn't messy!  That's a huge plus for me as a parent	pos
The "Essential Histories" series from Osprey could easily be compared to the Cliff Notes series.  They'll give you a nice introduction to a topic you are not familiar with, but no real depth.  Most volumns are under 100 pages; therefore, don't expect many "man in the trenches" stories. ---  --- This volumn is a nice introduction to a recent war, and presented a bit better than most in the series	pos

Read the ingredients. Contains refined flour and sugar, hydrogenated oil, corn syrup, and artificial colors.

I recommend this movie as a most usually high star. The Torch Song Trilogy has done something that no other movie producer has dared to do (I will leave it to you to identify what that is). The torch song trilogy has blended wisdom and humor in a comical theatrical version of the life of drag queen, who is more than what she appears to be on stage. It identifies with what most homosexuals yearn for and the strength it takes to get it. This movie is inspirational, comical, sad, and dramatic. There is no other movie of its kind, and no other movie compares. The movie identifies that love can overcome all- and that if there is one thing homosexuals want, it is acceptance, and if you can not do that then get out. This is a must have. The ONLY five star movie I have ever watched	pos
Great buy for 20 bucks. They look nice and fit well. They are distressed but it is not as bad as I thought it would be from reading the other reviews. They look nice with jeans and a dark shirt. Pretty comfy too	pos

This is the only blemish treatment that I have ever tried that will get rid of anything. Ive been using it for 8 years and it has never let me down.  --- You can use it as a spot treatment or if you have an area of clogged pores on your nose you can put a little on every night to help clear those up. --- It isnt meant to go on the places of your face where you have no acne or blemishes though. It is strong and can cause a little peeling if you put it on your entire face. --- It's a little pricey, but the size of this container will probably last you close to a year	pos

I didn't enjoy the film.  I also didn't enjoy the original play by Shakespeare.  King Lear is one of my least favorite Shakespeare plays.  I don't consider it particularly creative to remake a play that has already been done, and to add nothing of value to the original.  You can set it wherever you like, in medieval Japan or on the Moon, what's the difference.  It's King Lear, a downer of a play, there's nothing great about Ran just as there's nothing great about Lear, and it takes up three hours of your time. ---  --- A moron named Lear, or Hidetoro, or whatever his name is, relinquishes power in his kingdom and turns the power over to his oldest son.  The youngest son warns him that it is a bad idea because the sons will be disloyal to their father.  He is right, of course, and Hidetoro Lear gets treated shabbily.  He's wanted dead or dead. ---  --- In this treatment of the annoying plot, he loses his mind.  He has a faithful follower or two.  They overact.  There is nobody to root for in this depressing and ridiculously overrated downer of a play.  Lear Hidetoro is an absolute jerk.  Am I supposed to care what happens to him?  Why?  Because he used to be a powerful king, and a cruel one?  You may as well cry over Saddam Hussein. ---  --- Look at this movie with fresh eyes.  Look at Shakespeare's King Lear with fresh eyes.  This stuff simply is not very entertaining, and is not very good.  The hell with King Lear.  He's an annoyance	neg
I agree with most of the other reviewers that this is a very weak production with lots of pretentious talk and some pretty poor musical performances which are heavily cut to make more room for chatter. However the couple of minutes where Rory Block sings "If I had Possession Over Judgement Day" are worth the entire price of this DVD. Don't buy the tape 'cos you'll have to sit through so much stuff you won't make it, but on the DVD you can go straight to Rory Block and never watch the rest	neg

As a Certified Information Systems Security Professional, I can definitively state that this book does not cover everything that needs to be covered or in any depth whatsoever. I got this book based on the glowing reviews I found here, and I'm at a loss as to why these reviews would have recommended it. ---  --- The most aggrevating part about this book is the subtitle "An Integrated Approach to Security in the Organization." The book not only lacks effective security integration techniques, it doesn't seem to address the entire organization where it tries its half-hearted integration.	neg
Private eye Philip Marlowe is asked for help to get to Mexico by Terry Lennox. Marlowe likes Lennox and agrees to help him, but later Lennox commits suicide in the small Mexican town of Otatoclan. But why was Lennox driven to such extremes? ---  --- Later on, Marlowe is asked for his assistance in keeping the alcoholic writer Roger Wade on the staight-and-narrow. This is not really Marlowe's line of work, but he becomes entangled in the case especially as connections with Lennox begin slowly to emerge. ---  --- This is a longer, more ambitious novel by Chandler albeit displaying the same cynical, tough edge as the other Marlowe novels I've read. The greater length allows Chandler more space for character development and reflection. The danger of this is that the novel could have felt over-extended, but for me it didn't. The ending did not come as a total surprise, but as with every other Chandler novel I've read, enjoyment of the journey rather than satisfaction at the quality of the destination is the important thing. ---  --- G Rodger	pos
Despite the fact that Hanegraaff's name is the bigger of the two on the front cover, only the first 40 pages of this very small book are worth reading, and they are the writing of Paul Maier.  His research is helpful, but so limited in scope that you wonder if he wasn't given a week-end to write it and come up with as much as he could.  Every topic needs futher information.  A lot more could be said, and Maier seems to be the kind of scholar who could have done a lot more. ---  --- Hanegraaff contributes 29 pages of defense of the historical Jesus which is an even more surface-level reworking of information covered much better elsewhere. ---  --- That said, I would give this book to someone who isn't much of a reader but for whom The Da Vinci Code has raised some questions.  It isn't much more than a collection of scattered soundbites, but that may have been a good marketing strategy when there is already such a proliferation of secondary literature on what was only a piece of pulp fiction	neg
Great shows about Binky taking up cycling and learning to challenge himself. There's a cycling champion, Vance Legstrong, who inspires him to succeed (wonder who that character is modeled after). 'Operation DW' is about DW having surgery to get tubes put in her ears. Some really funny stuff in this one but that's pretty much par for the course with the DW based episodes	pos

I bought this case to protect the best bar phone on the market, the Sony Ericsson W810I. Within 2 Days the case already started to crack and chip. I dropped the phone once and the phone came flying out of the case. The case also scratches easily too.

I was expecting much more from this video. It did have kids doing poses, but it was hard to find the 13 year-old. Some of the circle games looked like they might  be fun.

I realize the price being so low that I would not receive a top of the line bike cover which is fine.  I did expect to receive a cover which would fit my brand new average size mountain bike ~ it does not.  since it does not fit over both tires, the plastic snaps that cinch it tight do not come together to make a complete unit.  I have to use clothes pins in certain areas to seal the cover in enough area to make the cover at least somewhat useable.  My tires and rims are left exposed to the elements and thus are getting mud and moisture on them when it rains.  Even the picture to the right of this review shows the cover with ample room all over the bike ~ very misleading! --- Very disappointed	neg
The metronome was everything I expected.  I wanted a metronome that was very loud so that it could be heard while playing in an ensemble and also one that had a volume control.  The sound is loud enough to be heard while playing ensemble and has good volume control.  It is not digital so one can easily switch tempos. It is light enough to be easily carried around.  What I would have liked, but did not expect is a tempo range that goes beyond 40 - 208.  Unfortunately, that seeems to be found only in digital.  	pos
This liner is thin as advertised, goes on easy, stays, and is really nice stuff.  Be warned, though, the lightest shade is REALLY light, and only good if you're REALLY pale.

I have always used foam rubber as a topper over our mattress but changed to this Memory Foam.  After using it for one month, I have taken it off the bed and it is back in the box it was shipped in.  I DO NOT like the Memory Foam at all.  It seems to be great when you first lie down on it and then after a hour or two my body just sinks down until it is against the mattress below it and I am not that heavy a person, 160 lbs. It is so hard to find foam rubber but I will search until I find it and never by Memory Foam again!  Doubt I can get my money back.  Have not talked to the Seller about it	neg

I'm pleased with the purchase. I bought this camera just under two years ago when I was getting ready for a trip abroad. ---  --- I spent six months in England, with five weeks travelling around Europe with this camera in its case on my belt. It's very sturdy if nothing else, between the trains, planes, hostels, and general bustle I'm very pleased with how well it held up. Nothing on it broke. ---  --- I probably took at least 400 pictures during my trip, if not more. Sure I've had to swap out batteries on one or two occasions in the two years I've had it, but my general feeling is that the batteries are holding up quite well. ---  --- The zoom on this camera is very nice. It's one of the better zooms I've seen on a simple camera of this type, or at least it was back when I bought it. ---  --- It also has several features that older film cameras do not, such as a timer that you can set before running to get in your own picture, or settings to take "Portraits" or "Night shots." ---  --- I know that this camera cannot compare to professional cameras, I know that it doesn't have all the frills of the new digital cameras, and I am not trying to compare it to those. I'm not a professional photographer, so I don't know how to use a camera with exchangable lenses and whatnot. I don't want a digital for personal and professional reasons. For a traditional film camera, this one is the best I've ever used. ---  --- BOTTOM LINE: Good quality photos, a sturdy build, excellent zoom lens, useful and easy to use features, and long battery life make this camera an excellent choice if you want a traditional film camera with a few perks	pos
As I lay in my non-oversized, non-jetted tub in my four star hotel in Portland, Oregon -- I unscrew the red plastic top of my beloved Tuscan Whole Milk. I savor the moment, taking a swig from my bottle of whiskey and swishing it slowly before I swallow. I'm building to the moment. Braving up for the inevitable splash of cold, white wonderful as it hits my joyful skin. "Hummana!" I exclaim, as the first drops hit my complimentary shower cap. Won't this be a treat. If only it came with a milkmaid. ---  --- Four teAts UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  	pos
Maybe the most engaging documentary ever made. Brilliant style is used in telling the story of one of the giants of the movie industry, producer Robert Evans. Giving magical illumination and motion to still pictures in a way that I could only describe as psychedelic.  ---  --- Being a film fanatic for the last 43 years I was shocked and ashamed to find that I had not heard of Robert Evans. In all my reading of credits over the years I had somehow missed his name. I had remembered seeing William Castle's name at the beginning of Rosemary's Baby but not Evan's. Then, at finding out that he was the driving force behind Love Story, The Godfather, The Godfather Pt.2, Chinatown and one of my personal favorites The President's Analyst and that he was a big reason why those movies were so good, well I was just dumbfounded. And these are just a fraction of the films he's produced. ---  --- Of course he didn't start as a producer. He had been in women's apparel with his brother and accredited their endeavours as the reason why women wear pants today. While lounging around a pool one day he was discovered by Norma Shearer, lauching his career into show biz. It seems he knows everybody and I mean everybody. ---  --- After watchng this extraordinary film I called my father to ask him if he had ever heard of this astonishing personality. I queried, "Have you ever heard of Robert Evans?" anxiously awaiting a "No" so I could tell him all about this amazing show biz entity. He replied, "You mean Bob Evans." Yes indeed, it seems he knows EVERYBODY. My father had come across him in his days as a buyer for Macy's. I asked, "Do you know what he does now?" "He's some sort of movie director or something now, isn't he.", Dad answered. I bought him the audiobook.  ---  --- Evans narrates both the documentary and the audiobook, both which are drawn from his autobiograghy by the same name. His voice is almost as amazing as his story and probably greatly enabled his prowess. He also lent his voice to the short-lived, hysterically irreverent cartoon series Kid Notorious that still airs on Comedy Central. ---  --- All in all, whether you know Evans or not this is a fascinating, beautifully made film about a producer whose achievements are arguably greater than Thalberg's and Selznick's combined. The story of his life and loves is the stuff of legends and it goes on and on. This is a must see for anyone interested in Tinseltown. PS:I don't usually care for the added features but these are worthwhile and the credits to the main part of the documentary are alone worth the price of the disc. What a hoot and more proof that he knows everybody. Ask your dad. Who knows? 	pos
I'm in awe about what this program can do, but I've yet to be able to use it to its fullest. It's not user friendly and I've been designing photo brochures, and marketing literature and multi-media presentations for years with other design software. ---  --- The Corel_Tutor is unwieldy to use and only illustrates the simplest projects. It takes a week to learn the glossary used for the program. And if you don't use it daily, it's easy to forget the glossary and toolbox icons. ---  --- I was hoping the "student & teacher" edition would be more instructive, but it's not. ---  --- I'm currently searching for a tutor who will teach me the complexities of using this program with a hands-on approach	neg
I took this case with me to my trip to New Zealand and it allowed me to take amazing pictures of rafting and cave tubing.  If I didn't have this case I would have missed out on amazing shots.  It's a great way to protect your camera from sand as well.  I loved it so much I actually bought one for my sister as well.  It is a great investment for anyone that doesn't want to worry about their camera getting ruined and also wants to take amazing underwater pictures and videos	pos
I have been using Source of Life Energy Shake for many years.  I recommend one scoop in 8 oz. of orange juice or milk twice a day.   Basically, I pour the milk in a shaker cup and put the scoop on top, close the shaker and shake for a few seconds.   This stuff tastes great and has loads of healthy vitamins, herbs, minerals, and more!     A few months ago, I actually used this drink to cut down on my Starbuck's daily double shot of expresso!   Guess a Source of Life Starbucks Latte would be great, maybe I'll try that someday!  This product deserves more than 5 stars and it is absolutely a great product in every way.

I suffer from upper back and shoulder tension.  I've been using neck warmers for years but recently lost the only one I had.  After looking at many warmers, I chose the Happy Wrap.

My Yorkshire Terrier can't wait until I'm done using it and fights with the cat to get it when I'm finished.	pos
I was really excited about this toy. I was very forgetful when it came to putting my son on his tummy, so I thought this would be a great toy for him to  have some good quality tummy time on. Wrong. He could care less about this toy. The second I'd lay him in front of it he would just roll onto his back. He was five months old when we bought it, and it is just sitting there. He STILL loves his Gymini and he is six months old now. Also, by the third day the aquarium had sprung a leak..which apparently has happened to almost everyone who  has bought this thing. Do not  purchase this toy, it takes up too much space, and it's a waste of money. Baby could care less about it	neg
Loved this DVD because it's useful on so many levels for my Spanish class.  Can use it for cultural discussions of music, social issues, history of Cuba, current policies toward Cuba, etc.  Most expecially, kids like music and the life stories of the musicians are quite moving.  Also, for the beginning student, many of the singers' dialogs are also not too hard for them to follow	pos
The Dictators are incredible. Few bands can alternativly spoof and embrace the rock 'n' roll ideals as these guys have, and their Spinal-Tap-meets-Ramones-mees-Beach-Boys style almost always works - almost. "Manifest Destiny" is a dissapointing release from the 'Tators. I mean its not a bad album, but the guys can do much better than this. There are a few good songs. "Disease" is hilarious, particulary the spoken word act from Handsome Dick at the begining. "Science Gone Too Far" is one of the band's catchiest tunes, proving they were as good as any of the big names from the 60s. Their closing cover of the Stooges' "Search & Destroy" is an okay interperatation of the classic. However, that's about it. The rest are mostly humorless FM-style rockers, and while the Dictators weren't selling out, they were certainly trying to become more accesible. Download those three tunes, and pick up every other album by the band	neg
This gem of a magazine covers common sense topics of interest to health concsious readers, primarily young adult women. Feature  articles cover topics on "fitness" (body), relationships and feelings ("mind"), "food", and "guidance" on specific health problems. The articles are well written and well researched. It contains delicious easy-to-make healthy recipes, beauty hints, as well as adventurous exercise options.  ---  --- Some examples of great articles in the July-August 2004 issue are, the "hike through history" article, the "one minute moves" and the "water workout" article. The first describes hiking trails in different regions of the country, for instance, "Chesapeake & Ohio Canal National Park" in Washington, D.C., "D & L Trail (norhtern portion) in Carbon County Pennsylvania, and "Railroad Grade Trail" in Apache Country, Arizona. The second provides a first person account of a very satisfactory exersize program describing aqua yoga, kick-boxing, and circuit training. The "one minute moves" article provides photos and descriptions of very realisitic and doable exersizes for busy people. ---  --- The food section has photos of farm fresh green beans, cut yellow squash, and sections of colorful bell peppers ... very excellent recipes follow. These foods are easily obtainable from any grocery store. There is also a tasty omelet recipe and some fresh fruit recipes which include melons, cantelopes, and honey dew. Overall, this magazine is highly recommended for women readers of all ages. Erika Borsos (erikab93	pos
I actually didn't mind Kiss The Girls because of Morgan Freeman. He saved the day in that movie. Plus, I'm always intrigued by serial killers and weird psychos. That always peaks my interest. But Ashley Judd's performance was just terrible in that (not that I think she's very good in anything I've seen but whatever). That's why I was delighted to find another thriller along those lines with Morgan Freeman, still playing Alex Cross, but thankfully without Ashely Judd (a better name for her would be Ashely Dudd but that's my opinion). Along Came A Spider was not only an interesting storyline, it was also very well acted. There's some twists of course which I won't spoil, but one I did see coming and the other blindsided me. All in all very enjoyable, especially for the low price I found this at. The little girl who is kidnapped in this, played by Mika Boorem, is terrific. It was kind of neat seeing her in this as I had just watched the movie Sleepover recently (also reviewed it...cute little movie...check it out) where she's more grown up. Hopefully we'll be seeing more things with her. Anyway, I found this engrossing enough and most times you can't go wrong with Morgan Freeman (except if Ashely Judd is in a scene with him, but that's not his fault) as he's an exceptional actor. Obsessed with serial killers, psychos and the like, just as I am? Then you will have a good time getting tangled up in the web of Along Came A Spider	pos

Look...to be fair, one man's BOTE is another man's "Manos". What I mean by that is some people may love this ep, but I personally didn't find it very funny and the movie is so bad that the sub-average riffing doesn't save it. The best lines that Mike & the robots make are when they speak for a character and add a line to something a person says. Unfortunately, the feature's horrible pacing, slow dialogue scenes, and atrocious acting are not enough, and it seems like the writers took a break on this one. Of course, even weak MST3K is better than pretty much any other show, but I must say this is certainly my least favorite episode from season 5 and at times feels like a Season 1 episode (the riffing is sparse and not really funny). If you are a newcomer and would like to see this show at it's best, get either "Manos: Hands of Fate" or "Red Zone Cuba"	neg
Wasted hours trying unsuccessfully to install the driver for the IOGEAR GIC251U 5-port USB card on a Dell Optiplex GX-1 running 98SE. (This computer already has 2 USB 1.1 ports.) The main problem is that the Add Hardware Wizard does not find a *.inf file in the IOGEAR-supplied CD folder and does not recognize the executable program that is in the CD folder. User has to cancel out of the wizard and execute the driver installation file as a stand-alone program. This results in installation of drivers that show up in the Device Manager. However, the installation wizard comes up at every subsequent reboot and the user must cancel out of it just to get the computer going. ---  --- Installed card seemed to work OK for a D-Link wireless adapter, but did not recognize a digital camera that was satisfactorily recognized by one of the non-IOGEAR 1.1 ports. The following actions did not help. (1) swapping the card to another PCI slot, (2) downloading and installing more recent driver file from IOGEAR website, (3) three calls to customer support, where I found sympathy but so solution	neg
This is a great drink. I wanted to try something that was different, and this definately fit in.

I haven't read them all, but it seems to me that most of the reviews here are about film technique. In addition to being ground-breaking from a director's standpoint, it's a great story. I've seen the Richard Gere version, and frankly, all I remember about it is the MTV music video for the theme song. The original gave me a completely different perception of the story, and the ending surprised me. I thought Jean-Paul Belmondo did a fantastic job with a complex character. There's a press conference scene that I thought was important to the story, as well. I wish I spoke French, because I think there are nuances in the dialogue not captured in the subtitles, but nevertheless, I think this is an enjoyable film in addition to all the cinematic masterpiece accolades. ---   --- 	pos

'Torzók' ('Abandoned') is a brilliant Hungarian film written and directed by Árpád Sopsits that takes us back to Hungary of 1960 when the oppressive Communist rule altered the lives of everyone, especially children.  The quality of the film is absolutely first rate from story to acting to filming to scoring.  It may be a tough film to absorb and certainly not for the easily offended, but it is a perfectly honed gem of a film that deserves wide audience exposure. ---  --- Áron (Tamás Mészáros) is a young lad whose life seems warm at first until suddenly a disease of vision impairment attacks his mother and his parents divorce: the mother is somewhere in a hospital and the father (Sándor Gáspár) beats the boy and eventually turns him over to a rigid orphanage for boys run by cruel taskmasters.  Áron undergoes initiation tactics by his fellow orphans but despite the beatings he is strong enough to survive.  He is befriended when he has his nightmares about his mother's blindness by his friend Atilla (Szabolcs Csizmadia) and the two bond emotionally and physically. In this bleak atmosphere a little light comes from the beautiful young housekeeper Anya (Krisztina Somogyi) but even her contributions are compromised by the cruelty of the staff.  There is one 'teacher' in the orphanage school, Nyitrai (László Gálffi) who has been reduced to his position as an 'imprisoned one' by the government and his sadness is offset by his playing his cello and studying his beloved astronomy. Nyitrai offers  Áron solace and introduces his 'fellow traveler' to the glory of the stars, giving Áron a map of the heavens that Áron cherishes - his window to a world beyond the dark confines of his prison-like orphanage.  He gradually wins over his fellow orphans and when Nyitrai, in the pit of depression for his life situation and the cruelty of the orphanage and the government, hangs himself. This horrid incident drives Áron to organize an escape from the orphanage, an event that is ultimately fractured with a death for which Áron feels responsible. And the end of the film fades into the many possibilities that event could trigger. ---  --- The atmosphere created by the stunning cinematography by Péter Szatmári defines the darkness that represents the orphanage well but also suggests the darkness in Hungary of that period.  The musical score by Péter Fejcsik, Tamás Görgényi, Ferenc Toma, and Balázs Winkler is some of the most beautiful composed for the screen, making tremendously effective use of the cello and lower strings.  In all, this is a brilliant piece of filmmaking, acted with depth in every role, and unveiling a portion of history and tragedy too often pushed to the background of our books.  Highly Recommended.

Once again, Koch, for reasons that I cannot possibly fathom, assumed that people would enjoy this movie more if the brilliant story and dialog weren't being constantly interrupted by those annoying sex scenes. I know I'm feeling large amounts of gratitude. It's gratitude when you want to disembowel someone, right? ---  --- At least the copy I bought was used, so Koch didn't make a dime off of me.

La Grange is probably at the top of most ZZ Top fans lists, and rightly so as it is superb, but the version contained on this collection is the one where they did some weird digital reverb stuff to the drum track, which completely destroyed the roadhouse vibe of the original recording.  It is so awful that I don't know how anybody can listen to it.  Thankfully they got smart and went back to the original for Rancho Texicano.  Clueless classic rock stations are still playing the version contained here, dummies. ---  --- Also, Waitin' on the Bus/Jesus Just Left Chicago are two absolutely essential tracks that are inexplicably missing here	neg
Very disappointing.  The shower head itself is massive - the size of a small dinner plate.  It is attached to a long hose which is so flexible it can't support the weight of the head when the shower is in use.

Maiden had evolved into a new metal standard in 1986. Not only did they lead the metal world with the greatest artwork on covers, but their music took a new form and justifed everything they had done in the past. Iron Maiden to Powerslave were just the stepping stones to this standard classic.  ---  The CD Starts out with CAUGHT SOMEWHERE IN TIME, a galloping bassline, and parallel guitar make it, not only a classic, but ahead of its time. The rest of the CD id in pure form. My favorite track, however, is ALEXANDER THE GREAT. The intro starts out with a whisper of that era, and slowly builds to the howl of, I feel, the battle cry of the great warrior of History.  ---  Iron Maiden did not dissapoint with this CD. It is very well mixed and produced, and remains a standard in my collection of CD's.	pos

We use our videocameras to tape preschool classrooms for observations.  The hope was to use the microphone to isolate conversations. --- To test the microphone.  I went to a Noisy Starbucks, huge lines, moderate music and tons of conversations.  I recorded on the video cameras mics, then used the zoom mic then used the gun feature.  I aimed the microphone at the barista yelling out the coffee orders.  In all instances, there was no difference in sound quality.   --- I then went to the Sony Style Store in the Mall and had her open a different Microphone and allowed her to install it. She read the package from a distance and then we listened to it in all three settings.  We could not find any difference.   --- I checked the camera instructions and there was no setting for the external mic.  Once the mic is attached and turned on, the external mic is suppose to override the on board mic.   ---  --- I am still insearch for a gun mic for a digital camera.  Many of the new camcorders with hard drives and DVD drives do not have a MIC input or Active Interface Shoe.  I would rather want a MIC input so that I can use a more powerful mic rather than being at the mercy of Sony to create one for their shoe.   ---  --- Overall, I am stuck.

As Crow puts it, if it had not snowed on that Monday in March.  The snow led to a chain of circumstances with Crow bringing a homeless teenager home for dinner and a place to stay for the night.  It turns out that the teenager, Lloyd, was a witness to a crime, and that draws Tess into the case when she connects Lloyd to a news reporter.  Events disrupt her life as the case develops and federal agents demand that she reveal the name of the source.  The story starts with a narration by Crow, and alternates between Crow, Tess, and other characters in the story.  You will get a lot more Crow in this novel than in others.  The story has an interesting ending, and you can wonder if Lloyd will show up again.  You get some information along the way about Baltimore soup kitchens and the homeless, and a view of the underside of society where life is sometimes cheap	pos

Then every picture I took after that (same settings - fine, HQ, poster 10m etc... and vertical lines started showing on the LCD screen and the pictures were all washed out.

Four Brothers is yet another nail in the coffin of John Singleton's increasingly moribund moviemaking career.  The director - who burst upon the scene in 1991 with the vibrant and gritty "Boyz n the Hood" - has here mounted a film so burdened by implausibility and contrivance that it makes one wonder if the once-promising filmmaker will ever be able to get back on track again.  The story, reeking of artificiality, features Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin and Garrett Hedlund as four troubled young men raised by the same foster mother.  When she is killed in a convenience store robbery, the quartet launches into action, seeking revenge against the perpetrators and becoming slowly convinced, through their investigation in the neighborhood, that the killing might not have been as random in nature as they had been initially led to believe.   ---  --- The main weakness of this film is that it gives us virtually no reason to care about any of the characters.  By not showing us any scenes between the boys and their foster mother (except for one embarrassingly bad Thanksgiving dinner fantasy sequence that looks as if it were conceived by a first-year film student), we are forced to take their relationship totally on faith, rendering the boys' thirst for revenge arbitrary at worst and academic at best. ---  --- The acting is uniformly flat, with the characters little more than wafer-thin stereotypes, and even the action scenes come across as surprisingly mundane and second-rate given the Singleton pedigree in this area.  The boys' running around from venue to venue in their Detroit neighborhood, brandishing guns in full view of the populace and screaming for information about their mother's killer, is ludicrous on the face of it and often reduces the film to the level of cheap low comedy burlesque.   ---  --- With nary a single moment that rings believable or true, "Four Brothers" is by-the-book filmmaking from a director who has proven that he has the wherewithal and talent to do so much more.	neg

This software now constantly tries to get you to upgrade to a "better" package - the schedule C for small business.  I used to like TurboTax, but it has really gotten to be a pain.  ---  --- And finally, I spent two days trying to e-file, always getting a Server busy message from Intuit.  This is AFTER they got my credit card number and $34. to file the fed and state tax returns.  So I had to hand assemble the return and make the trip to the Post Office.  Intuit lobbied the Gov to let them keep this big $$$ plum, and then screwed it up.  They had this same problem last year, and it is WORSE this year. Time to call all our representatives and get E-File FREE from the IRS.  It saves the IRS money, far more than it costs.

Owning 2 mercedes, it is a pain to drain normally.  Using the MityVac, you insert the hose, pump the vacuum and it draws out the oil.  My only problem has been a loose seal at the top of the lid.

After owning a P-touch labeler for years,I found the need for a more duable label than my "M" tape was providing. I opted for this "TZ" tape labeler. Good price,looks good. What a mistake!!! The only thing well designed about this unit is it's abilty to waste more tape than it uses!! If you print a label of any size,count on it costing you two full inches of tape to do it!!! At $20.00 a roll,prepare to be screwed each time you push the print button.Then go find the scissors and cut the excess off,so the label does not look as stupid as the person who designed this pile of junk!!! But cheer up you can push six buttons,every time,to reduce the margin to "narrow". This will reduce the waste to a half inch on ONE side of the label,and print two small dots on the other side,this will show you where to cut it with your scissors,to match the "narrow" side. Also you must do ALL settings for EVERY label EVERY time!!Another "great feature,it will use the same amount of tape regaurdless of print size,so you will only print large print.What a joke!!! What a hassle!! Now the good news. I used to make lots of labels,and now I only make labels for VERY important items. And only when I am up to getting mad for doing so. I really wish amazon would allow us to give items a negative five stars! You have been warned	neg

I purchased these so I wouldn't slip on my sticky mat when my hands sweat.  However, they didn't work well for this purpose because there is only one elastic strip that goes between your first and second finger and it allows your hands to slip right through the yoga paws.  Additionally, after only a few classes, the sticky material started coming off of the yoga paws, particularly on the foot paws.  I guess they would be okay for someone who doesn't ever have sweaty palms and who doesn't do any intense postures.  Otherwise, I would recommend doing what I do now - use a pair of weight lifting gloves with a leather/suede palm for extra traction on your sticky mat	neg

I eagerly snapped up this ionic hair dryer about over a year ago because of it's retractable cord and folding capabilities. Even the price was attractive. It really did take up little room in my bathroom drawer and the retractable cord was a plus. I thought I had the perfect blow dryer because it did what it was supposed to do and quickly. Now for the bad news:  the retractable cord became chewed up and frayed after daily use and it became apparent that the cord was ultimately going to fray completely in due time. Then, the folding handle, low and behold, broke in half one morning. (Of course, the warranty had long expired). This dryer is too fragile to consider using on a daily basis and I consider myself a careful person when it comes to handling small appliances such as hair dryers. When I've replaced hair dryers in the past, it was been because they've simply reached the end of their lifespans and burned out.  I'd caution anyone to consider this before buying because these 2 features alone, while very appealing, can shorten an otherwise good hairdryer's lifespan.  I've now purchased a T3 Tourmaline (a featherweight, quiet hairdryer with no retractable cord or folding handle) which seems to work just fine and appears to have a much longer lifespan. 	neg

I decided to buy this product before i read the reviews.  In my opinion the trays stay on better than the strip kind.  There is alot of whitening goo that you press into your teeth and it helps the trays stay in place.  The first morning the goo came totally out of my bottom tray but that was becuase i pressed too hard.  I havent had the problem since.   --- I noticed a difference after 3 days and they are much whiter after 7 days.  My gums turned white if the whitening goo touched them for the full 45 minutes and felt tingly and hurt slightly.  The pick color returned within an hour. It really isnt as bad as the other reviewers make it seem. --- All in all if you are looking for a product that works, this is a good one.  I was truly surprised at how well they worked.  I will be purchasing these in the future	pos
As a fan of Gitlin, I was hoping that he'd give me the bottom line - his bottom line - on the air we breathe today, the same way that brave souls such as Lasch, Marcuse, and Bell have done.  But Gitlin isn't brave.  He admits, honestly, up front, that he will reach few conclusions, and merely wants to lay out what we face each day on the streets, on TV, and on the net.  What follows is a stream-of-consciousness depiction of life today.  I want more than that from Gitlin.  I want his conclusions, not some lame statement that he hasn't reached any yet.  He's not getting any younger.  Lots of other fabulous thinkers have failed at this stage of their lives.  It's time for his masterpiece - the next book, perhaps	neg
This Chromatic tuner, powered by one AAA battery, has a built-in mike for acoustic instruments and a plugin for electrics.  The LCD dial shows the specific tone, lights red if too high or too low, and green when you have it just right. I have used it on several 6-string (acoustic) guitars, a 12-string and a 5-string banjo.  The results are incredible- reliable and true. --- For years, I tuned by ear. You know... 5th fret, etc.  What I didn't realize that an "E" is not just an "E" - there may be (are!) thousands of tones - all of which are "E's" - and this explains why though tuned OK by ear, one chord would sound fine while others would sound out of tune. --- This tuner fixes that. In tune is in tune. --- I have found it to be among the best (and least expensive) musical investments I have ever made - I wonder how I tolerated the way I sounded before I discovered it - let alone what others may have experienced! --- A great piece of equipment at a great price. --- I recomment it heartily	pos

These shoes are no longer being made in Italy but in India.  The quality of the material utilized and the construction is cheap and nothing like they used to be.  I have worn this same style of Bostonian (Marco) for several years, and was completely satisfied.  This is a cheap imitation of what used to be a great, comfortable, well-constructed shoe.  Return to having them made in Italy!  	neg

I bought this lens based on the super telephoto ability and low cost. You truly get what you pay for, and this thing isn't worth a plug nickel. I took a few shots on a tripod and could not believe how terrible this lens was @ 300mm (480mm on a Digital Rebel XT). Incredibly soft. Even stopped down, I would never want to make an enlargement from it. Stay away. Don't believe the fools who are novices, you will be disappointed with this lens. You're much better off to buy the older & used 100-300mm 5.6 (the L version costs more too) but both are so much better than this junker. You're even more crazy if you think you can take decent photo's with this lens handheld. Having switched from Nikon when switching to digital, I almost judged Canon from this one lens, which I'm glad I didn't. Don't waste your money or learn the hard way like I did. This lens also had terrible purple fringing, almost as bad as the kit 18-55mm. After extensive research and testing I now own and am happy with the following Canon lenses: --- Canon 10-22mm --- Canon 28-105mm (3.5 version) --- Canon 100-300mm (5.6 non-L version) I will sell for the L version when I can afford it.  ---  --- The kit 18-55mm makes usable shots, but when I could afford it, I sold it too.  ---  --- You will get better results buying a Rebel XT and an older 100-300mm than you would with a brand new XTI and this terrible 75-300mm lens.	neg
I like Oregon Scientific products, but their previous Atomic Alarms had quirky controls -- often leading to changing the time zone in the middle of the night rather than turning off the alarm.  This one's lots better! ---  --- The projection feature works OK, though doesn't really focus sharply at the close distances I'd prefer to use.  The eight minute snooze alarm is great -- just the right interval! ---  --- Overall, a nice, useful, moderately expensive alarm clock	pos
Bought this camera to replace my 35mm camera.  Am pleased with the trade up that I made. ---  --- The shape is similar to my old film camera.  Thought this would make it easier to adjust to the smaller size of it.  It has made the transition relatively smooth.  I'm sure there are smaller cameras out there, but this one is small enough.  The display is also a good size - bigger than most that I looked at. ---  --- I am not a genius at computers, so I was concerned that I would need to adapt to downloading pictures from the camera to the PC.  But, all I need to do is plug in the cord and click a button.  Very easy to follow any instructions. ---  --- I did notice that the display "freezes" for a second or two after a picture is taken.  This is not generally a problem for me as most pictures are posed shots.  I did run into some lag time during an Easter egg hunt this past weekend, but still managed to get about a dozen good shots. ---  --- Overall, I like the camera and only wish I had gotten up the courage to go digital sooner	pos
I was disappointed in this video.  I came to it not as a devout Catholic but as a fan of travel videos.  In other words, I watched this video with the same motivation I would have to watch Shackleton's Antarctic exploration, or something from the Globe Trekker series. ---  --- With that in mind, the target audience for this video is not me.  It is the religious Catholic.  Therefore, from my perspective, I can't recommend it.  I'm not one for all the pomp and circumstance of religion.  I don't enjoy worshipping the "Holy Father", or watching the construction of the clownish uniform of the Swiss Guard. ---  --- If you are a devout Catholic you will probably enjoy this video.  If you are not, and just came to the video because you wanted a Globe Trekker style tour of the Vatican, you are likely to be disappointed. ---  --- And that is what these reviews are for - to let you know whether you will enjoy the video or not	neg
I am a novice photographer, so take this with a grain of salt...  I just bought this kit and it included no instructions and lots of components.  I suppose if you are accustomed to using these kits, putting them together must seem self-explanatory.  If you are new to these kits you will find it frustrating.  It is also frustrating to discover Smith Victor does not have a support site (just references on photography).  They do not even provide a support # or address.  Keep all this in mind when considering something from this company	neg

We like this car seat for the price we paid. Likes: love the easily adjustable belts - we often let the straps out a lot to get her in it without her being uncomfortable and then tighten it appropriately. The 5 point harness is great. Love that the car seat is compatible with different strollers. Dislikes: It doesn't recline as much as we'd like and the head padding is superficial. Our baby's head tends to fall forward a lot. The sun canopy seems like it was designed as an afterthought - it certainly works more than adequately, but doesn't move easily. Finally, the handle is difficult to move from position to position. Overall though, for the price, it's a good seat.	pos

 This kit is very poorly detailed, and matches the filming miniatures only in the sense of the basic overall profile being pretty close. ---  ---  There's a MUCH better model of an X-Wing out there. Do a web search for a company called "Fine Molds"... it's a Japanese company that makes a finely-detailed 1/72 scale X-Wing that is modeled directly from the filming miniatures, including parts to build different ships from the original film's Death Star battle, including standing & seated pilot figures & different droid types. ---  ---  It's a bit more expensive than this kit, but you get what you pay for. 	neg
Do not buy this mattress, it is not safe.  This mattress does not fit either of the cribs we have for our twins.  When I called Kolcraft to inform them, the CS rep was rude and insistent that this mattress was standard size and would fit, and that they haven't had any complaints.  She also implied it was my crib that was the wrong size.  We have 2 cribs and the sealy matress in the crib the twins still share fits nice and snug.  The Kolcraft has at least an inch gap and can move around quite easily	neg

i hate this phone.  i moved to miami and cannot get reception anywhere. it  cuts me off the minute i enter any building so i am stuck standing outside to talk.  i had to get a land line for the first time in over 5 years because i cannot use it in my apartment, so i am wasting tons of money on a land line with overpriced long distance rates.  but here's the thing:  other people on verizon using a different brand phone like LG have absolutely no problem!  they actually get a couple bars of reception, whereas i always have one or none at all.  i returned the phone and all they could do was give me another just like it... with all the same problems.  i actually had over 30 dropped calls in one month.  i am now stuck with it for the next 2 years unless i want to purchase another one for full price.  on top of that, people are right when they say the battery life is ridiculous.  unless you never talk on it, the battery wears out in a hurry.  and the volume buttons on the side are very hard to use when talking.  i usually end up putting it on speaker phone by accident.  i am trying to decide which is the lesser of two evils.. chucking this one in the drawer and purchasing a different one, or wasting money on a land line.  whatever you do, don't get suckered in by it's cute pink color, because underneath it's pretty exterior it's junk	neg

This camera is simply amazing!  I started out with a Canon G2, and then a Canon G6, and then a Canon 20D, and now this Canon 1D Mark II N.  I debated and researched for 3 months between the 1DS Mark II, 5D, and 30D.  My decision was primarily narrowed down to the 5D and this 1D Mark II N.  Yes, I wish this camera was a full-frame and also shared the 12.8 MP like the 5D, but you know what?  It practically killed me trying to weigh the pros and cons and finally I made my decision to go with this one and I'm 110% glad that I did.   ---  --- For me, this camera is definitely THE ONE to get because the 45 point Focusing, 8.5 fps, and the 1D Pro Body/Interface/Menu/Layout, etc is what really makes this camera worth it and the deciding factor.  Trust me, if you don't know how seriously fast the 8.5 fps really is, you need to go out to your camera store and try it out before you decide.  Because of this 8.5fps alone, I'm actually able to capture a lot of shots that I normally get lucky getting with my 20D.  And with a 5D at 3fps, I just said forget it...No way.  I'm not even a professional taking pictures for a living.  This is just purely a fun hobby for me and stepping up from a 20D to this camera is out of this world.  With the phenomenal auto focusing, additional metering, it's like I'm now playing with a Bentley (with the 1D MK2 N) coming from a Mercedes C230 Hatchback (The cheapest Mercedes that people buy just because it's a Mercedes name and they don't want to spend any more money on a real Mercedes).  This camera and the photos truly almost help me take pictures like a pro.   ---  --- Also, I don't shoot action pictures all the time, and I do love portrait photography, and landscapes and printing and blowing up large sized pictures.  But even with the 1.3 crop factor, there is still a HUGE improved difference going from a 1.6 crop and you won't have vignetting problems with some lenses that you'll have on a 5D.  With this 1D MK2 N, you can still take wonderful wedding photography, landscapes, etc.  As much as I'd like to have 12.8MP like the 5D, 8MP is really all that we need these days unless you're going to blow up and print photos that are larger than 8X10's or around there.  Unless you're printing extremely large posters and whatnot, you can pretty much do everything with this camera that the 5D can.  The resolution and MP is definitely enough.  Plus, it's also invaluable to know that you have the 8.5 fps available and ready to use if you need to and you can also tone it down and use a slower fps if you need to.  The extra bonuses with this camera which I look at as a secondary positive, are the weather seals, pro-build high quality construction body, easy to use and navigate menu system, you can see the iso information in the viewfinder as well as the lcd screen at all times, dual memory card capability, you can shoot on 2 memory cards at the same time as one for backup or use 2 separate cards independently, built-in battery grip (you don't have to shell out extra for this), longer battery life than the other cameras, best customization and most options that you can set to your liking, more than the 5D or the 20D or 30D.  I could go on and on but definitely get this camera if you can afford it.  Otherwise, the 5D is also a great choice too if you need to save the money, and all you do is take landscape pictures all day long, or never will have a use for fast action or have a need to capture quick moments, and don't want the fast and most accurate focusing system that's great for ai servo. 	pos
This durable grill mat does an excellent job.  The product's material absorbs grease without burning or warping.  In my opinion, what I like best about it is that it catches and holds the majority of solid particles which fall from the grill (which turn into hard-to-clean stains just as often as grease).  It is very easy to clean.  I highly recommend this product	pos

If this album didn't come out at its destinated time, 2006 would have been one of the worst years for gospel music.  Outside of Kurt Carr's cd, this album makes singing gospel music worthwhile.  Donald Lawrence knows how to send out a group and bring in a new era of singers.  That's basically what this finale does, it brings into the forefront the future of the gospel music scene.  We have new artists emerging in Blanche (McAlister-not sure if she is going to just do the first name like MaDonna, Cher, Mandisa, ummmmm, think about it!!!!!!!!), DeWayne Woods (thanks for the testimony and great Sunday morning rocking song - this is hint to all church musicians sing this song when church is a lil dead and pick it up), The Murrills, LaJeune Thompson (sang girl), and Sheri from the duo of Ted & Sheri.  There are so many hits on the whole cd from God Is, God, You Are An Heir, Giants, Blessing from Abraham, Encourage Yourself, of course all of the older stuff.  One thing missing is Kelly Price should have guested on I Walk With God or bring back Stephanie Mills. 	pos

I hate Monopoly, but loved the idea of making my own game board. Sadly, MYOO had so many limitations! I gave it a higher ED rating because you can turn the game into an educational one, but it isn't intrisically educational. --- It doesn't print out spaces with color bars, just little green squares that you glue on the board below the pre-printed color bars. The background on everything you print is School Bathroom Green. You are stuck with Lotto squares on the board (bad for me since I believe gambling is evil). And you only have twelve Good/Bad News cards. I liked making my own money, though.  --- I figured out how to do most of the same stuff in Word. Here's how: --- I took the board from a "Your Town" clone of Monopoly and measured between the big squares. I think the individual squares are 2.5 by 3.5, but it doesn't matter, since your board may be different. In Word, I used a legal-sized paper (I think that's A5 for you Brits) and made a table that was nine columns that's how many are on my board) and two rows. Then I messed with it to get the proportions correct. You can fit three rows on one sheet of legal paper, if the return is really small, like 5 points. That gives you space to cut.  To get color bars, get your cursor in the top row. Type any letter.  --- Then highlight it, go up to "format" and click on borders and shading. Click on shading, click on a color, then make sure it says "cell" and not text or table. I use only 15 percent for most colors. Click on OK and you should have a color bar. Type in whatever text you want. Then click below to type in your property name. On printing, I found the last squares were outside the printing range, so I will only have eight squares next time and will print a separate sheet for "railroad" squares. --- The corner squares are about 2.5 inches on my board. I would recommend you make them bigger, then trim to size, so you won't have any dead space on your board. Cut and glue to a board you picked up at a thrift shop or yard sale and painted or covered. --- The property cards. These were actually easier than I thought. Make a table one column wide and two rows deep. Make it fill the whole page. Color as above, and type in whatever you want. When you print them out, print out 8 or 16 pages to a sheet to get cards. --- For chance and community chest ... well, what I came up with was using mail merge and a shipping label template. You  --- just print out on regular card or paper, and cut. The data file used for the merge would have your classy one-liners. I don't know about putting graphics in. Also, I can't figure out how to use merge. I did it once but can't figure it out now. --- Money I haven't been able to do. I have QuarkXpress and Adobe Pagemaker but don't know how to use either program. Plus, I wanted to make the money in Paint or something simple. Hope these directions help someone	neg

This bar is larger that most nutrition or meal replacement bars - that much is true. What is also true is that is contains more fat.  ---  --- What you will notice with the first bite, is that the bar seems somehow "inflated". There is an emptiness to consistency of the bar. You are not getting the quality nutrition you would get from a Myoplex or Apex bar. Stick with those brands for pure nutrition and FAR BETTER TASTE.  ---  --- These METRX bars leave you feeling as though you've eaten something that was bad for you - like after you eat a dessert, yet these will not be mistaken for desserts	neg
Though this book does present all the necessary information for learning about abnormal psychology, it's the dryest, most aesthetically difficult to read textbook... especially if you happen to be studying the material online/through independent study.

I first read this book back in the mid-80s after watching the miniseries starring Gary Cole as Dr. Jeffrey MacDonald.  The miniseries absolutely riveted me, as did this book.  But upon repeated readings, I began to pick up inaccuracies and errors. I found that the book, rather than answering questions about this case, caused me to question more and more.  --- Joe McGinniss, while never a stellar writer to begin with, was eventually exposed as the worst kind of writer, twisting facts and quotes to serve his own purpose, which was to sell his theory and therefore, his book.  I have nothing against Mr. McGinniss forming his own opinion as to Dr. MacDonald's guilt or innocence, but to omit certain facts and blatantly lie about others and misquote principals and research in order to further your own propaganda is sickening.   --- If you want Joe McGinniss' theory on how and why the murders happened, with no regard to the cold hard facts and legal evidence, pick this book up.  If you want to read about the case, with all the facts in place both supporting and questioning Dr. MacDonald, do as other reviewers have suggested and read "Fatal Justice", a far more in-depth review of the case and evidence and form your own opinion. 	neg

My [...] really likes this train puzzle. He knows his alphabet and is able to pick out which puzzle piece comes next in line and attach it. It goes straight across and is over 10 feet long. There is also a picture with each letter on the piece and this has helped him with words beginning with that letter. He will say "Q quail" or "N nut" when he is putting the piece on. The pieces are easy to attach, thick and very sturdy. The pieces comes apart with no worry of ripping the picture off. This would make a really nice gift for a 2-4 year old. The box is also very nice to keep the puzzle in.	pos
I believe this is the best game in the genre.  It's gotten more play out of me than Master of Magic, Heroes of Might and Magic, Age of Wonders, Warlords, Disciples, Civilization, Alpha Centauri, Master of Orion, Space Empires, or Stars.  Once of the other posters says they have bad support, but that's not been my experience.  I've found their continued support and patches to be as good or better than any of the afore mentioned titles -- not bad for a 2 man team. ---  --- There is an amazing amount of variety in factions and would-be-gods you can play, and best of all it is for the most part solidly based upon Mythology -- far superior to the typically D&D derivative fantasy.  Multiplayer is fantastic. ---  --- It is a complex game however, and not to everyone's tastes. Definitely check out the demo first.  Beware though, it's addictive stuff! ---  --- Also check out the fan made maps on their website as well, some of which are quite pretty.  If you're stuck getting started, try the excellent Walkthrough by Bruce Geryk, also linked from their site	pos
I was introduced to Nitin through my cousin who lives in England. She saw him live in London and raved about it...so off I went in search of this artist. He was difficult to find; nonetheless I was determined. I am one of those people who love music from almost all genres, cultures and corners of the globe. In other words, I am not a radio-pop saccharine sweet loving music listener.

Being a fan of the better CG and graphics of Sci-Fi such as Star Trek (the newer ones)  I was greatly surpised at how good the V series was.  V: The Final Battle is the second installment of the saga, so make sure to buy V: The Miniseries first.  The storyline is good, and characters are likeable and three-dimensional.  I highly recommend it for any Sci-Fi fan.  For old hands it is a fun movie, and for newcomers to both the series and the genre it is a good introduction	pos
This magazine comes with lots of advertisements - 70% or more. Plus, articles (less than 15 articles in every issue) in the magazines are not very useful.  I subscribed the magazine because it is inexpensive and it is rated high by other subscribers.  Now I realize I made a mistake. 	neg
I do not think suction cup mounts work very well.  This one is no exception.  While attaching and detaching my Garmin Nuvii is easy enough, the cup does not support the weight.  I was disappointed that a Friction bag was not available for my Nuvii.  However, I was able to Jury-rig an acceptable if less than pretty compromise.  I ordered the Friction mount, removed the screws on the bottom, detaching the mounts that would not fit my Nuvii, and stapled velcro strips purchased at Walmart across the base of the suction cup into the friction mount.  I have been cross country using this system and it works.  the Garmin Portable Friction Mount for GPS 010-10306-00 combined with the suction cup is a much better solution than the cup by itself	neg

I bought this just to try something new.  I love peach and mango flavors, and this sounded very good.  I do think it's a good drink, but whether or not I am able to think better because of it is up for debate.  I doubt I'll buy these again if only because they are quite pricey.  12 small cans (the liquid volume is only a smidgeon over one cup) for over twenty dollars?  It's close enough to $2 a can to make it not cost effective to get vitamins and minerals this way.  The taste is good, but I have had lots of other healthy drinks that taste just as good for less than a third of the cost.  But now I know, this drink is not for me.  If you like good-tasting nutritious drinks that cost a LOT of money, this one's for you! 	neg
I have been using Microsoft Operating Systems for a very long time, and, i still say that this is the best System out there, for many reasons. ---  --- An increasing amount of Linux and Mac users have made the claim that they are more compatible with programs, and are less vulnerable to virus and hacks. ---  --- In Response to Linux Users- --- Stay away from Linux, Linux is free for a reason. It is compatible with very very few programs as it is, and that number will only decrease. For Gamers - Rarley do i see a Linux compatible game. Just stay away from this system. ---  --- For Mac Users- --- Mac's also have a lesser amount of compatible programs. Fewer and Fewer programs can run on them, and like linux, that number will only decrease. The only thing keeping Macintosh alive is Itunes. Which is compatible with Windows. Besides, When Direct X 10 Comes out, it will only be available for Windows, making Macintosh's un-usable for new games when the next windows OS comes out (Microsoft Vista). The computers are also generally more expensive than Windows.  Btw - You can get viruses on Mac's	pos
I will not try to say that I asserted the painstaking, analytic effort that some would argue is necessary for an appreciation of Heidegger. More than that, I have no interest in doing so. It is largely agreed by the majority of his readers that this book deals with the question of being (existence), and my reading didn't lead me to any other conclusions. So as I said I have no interest in reading this a second time, further, deeper, or slower. ---  --- Being and Time is chock full of invented terminology, to the extent that Michael Inwood was able to profit from his publication of A Heidegger Dictionary. Whatever you might think the word "world" means, for instance, is not what Heidegger means, and he will explain that to you throughout the duration of an agonizing 40 pages or so. This is the case with his entire vocabulary. If there was any need for all of the inventions and distinctions made by Heidegger, I would not bring this up as a crticism. ---  --- Beyond the unventilated, severely sober, and utterly uninspiring character of Being in Time, I also call attention to the futility of it's project. If Heidegger was right about the historical neglect toward the question of being, perhaps more than 2000 years of historical peoples have been aware of something that eluded him: that there is no question of being.  ---  --- Why is "the question of being" so problematic? Because it is unanswerable, maybe. Or if it is answerable, we're not in any position to answer it. "Being" implies some kind of unvarying stability that just doesn't make sense. And if you posit an idea that is so concrete, so constant, you can't just bend it to make it fit reality. You've already betrayed your questioning. Truth, including the truth of being, is a local phenomenon. Truth is not always and forever true - it's true when it's true. But Heidegger wanted an everlasting truth, a dogmatic anthropology. ---  --- Worse than the general uselessness of his project, and the toxic dregs left in his wake, Heidegger is guilty of not even presenting his ideas in an intersting or thought-provoking way	neg
Noah Webster's book is fascinating reading for today's students and teachers alike, as well as for the average citizen, as there is much to learn from it.  While it may be inappropriate to resurrect it as an  official school text, it certainly has a place in every school library.   One of the most notable features is the comprehensive phonetic system used,  with diacritical marks (accents) applied to all relevant vowels and  consonants; words are divided according to syllables and stress.  It also  spells the names of letters of the alphabet; something which tends to be  ignored in modern teaching.  The terminology of traditional grammar is  used, and there are copious word lists, with words grouped according to  common factors. I have no hesitation in recommending this book to all  students of the English language for the above reasons and for many other  interesting aspects (now-archaisms:thy/thou...; foreign words and phrases;  abbreviations explained; punctuation; etc).  This book should remain a  spelling classic	pos

When you watch commercial children's television, you have to accept the commercials because, after all, the programs are "free". But when you pay to subscribe to Nickelodeon magazine, I don't expect for it so be so full of alluring ads targeting children. These ads appear similar to the editorial content. It seems like 50% of the pages are advertisements! ---  --- I was disappointed and won't be renewing our subscription. Better to look at something from the Highlights magazine series.	neg
This is a great idea, however if your crib has anything larger than a Jenny Lind style piece of wood on it, it won't work.  We don't have a sleigh style crib, but the top edges were still too large for the velcro to even touch.  It would be great if they would come up with a larger size to work for the more popular/larger style cribs everyone seems to be making/buying these days	neg
I bought this for my 5 year old son for Christmas.  Not only did he think it was great but also his 7 and 9 year old sisters.  There are so many games that there was something for all of them. We took the toy with us to Grandma's and even the older cousins found it very fun and entertaining. ---  I really like that they can play all the games in Spanish too.  Once they have got the hang of a game in English they can do it in Spanish and it helps increase their vocabulary.  I was a little nervous if it would be worth the $50 because I had seen the barbie laptops and some others at radio shack. This one seemed like the best choice and was hoping this would be worth it.  In my opinion it is much better than the others we tried in the store and I would definately recommend it	pos

I purchsed this product for my husband and he hates beauty products. When we got it the minty scent was soooo strong in the box. When we opened the box it was like a minty apple juice drink. He used it and I was all over him and the minty smell gave him just the right energy to "bring it"	pos

Sephora Roll-up blotting paper is so handy. Whenever you have to freshen up, this is great to use before you powder your face.

I don't usually write reviews but had to voice my opinion on this toy.  I agree with the other review that the dolphins do not stay attached to the chariot and this frustrates my 4-year-old daughter!

When I first got this item I was very pleased. It was so cheap and it looked great. It snaps so easily on and feels really cool. However, after about 3 weeks, the duller, not so shiny coat that I liked on the cover started to come off. Beneath it was a very shiny black coat. I was so disappointed, I took it off and went with my original cover. It looks really bad and just looks like something I've had for 3 years instead of just 3 weeks. I am very displeased with this item	neg
Bought this case along with a Digital Rebel XTi, my first SLR. Instead of the 18-55mm kit lens I opted for the Sigma 17-70mm lens. Sad to say, but the case fits only with the kit lens..

We were excited to find such a good deal. The clam shell cracked almost immediately and just got worse. The home charger never worked.

I recently purchased the Zooper Tango Sidy by Side Double Stroller.  I had done some looking at stores & extensive research online.  Suddenly, I found this on Amazon of all places.  The reviews were great & the price was right.  I bought it, a little hesitant that I hadn't gotten to test drive it.   ---  --- This stroller is great!  It fits through doorways, it's a little tight in an aisle, but we're talking about a double stroller here, it's going to be a little wide!  I have a 2 year old & 1 year old, so I do find that it veers to the side that my 2 year old sits on, just slightly.  It is heavier than the Peg Perego Aria is, but it feels much more solid.  Folds easily & somewhat compactly (again, it's a double stroller!).  It fits into the back of my Honda Odyssey with room for bags & whatnot. ---  --- I would recommend this stroller to anyone with twins or 2 little ones.  My 2 year old likes to "nap" (recline the seat) while we are walking.  The back zips off, she likes to look out the back.  A 5 point harness keeps everyone safe, but I find that I usually just use it as a waist seat belt.   ---  --- Storage is limited, my husband wants to customize the basket area - it sounded like his plans involved a hack saw...There is a spot for a bottle of water or misc items (a hanging net type basket - just big enough for a bottle of water) & a zip pocket on the back of the stroller.  However, if you unzip the back & remove it, you have lost this pocket.  I did read that McClaren has a stroller organizer for about [...] - we were planning on buying this to carry more stuff. ---  --- Overall, I do love our new stroller & would highly recommend it!	pos
I am writing this review primarily to let people know what to expect from this product, since Amazon/Toys R Us don't seem to have a clue - even the image was provided by a thoughtful customer. I bought this in-store at Toys R Us because sizing information was not available online (except for the size of the box, for some bizarre reason) and I didn't want to take a chance with getting the wrong size. So let me share that information with you - this helmet is suitable for head sizes from 20.5" to 22". I think overall that this is a great set, but I marked it down a point because it does not include elbow protection. From my own experience learning to skate or even snowboard, I can say that I would generally fall onto my knees or the heels of my hands, so knee pads and wrist guards would be perfect for me. But with a young child who knows?! This is for my neice (I am not a parent) and whilst I am generally happy with the set as it is, I think it would be nice to include the elbow protection (which is afterall available in other sets, but does not appear to be available separately) to make a complete safety package. Perhaps we are supposed to buy and extra set so we have the elbow pads and two sets of knee pads, or perhaps I am a touch too cynical	pos
This is one of the most fun games I've every played.  There are tons of belly laughs as people try to bluff their way through an answer to a question.  I find the questions (and answers) are quite educational too, I've learned a lot from these questions.  A group of family members played at Christmas (6 of us) and it was hilarious to watch some people try to come up with an answer to the question (a bluff).   We even let our 5 year old nephew "play" and he was pretty good with coming up with some bluffs.  Try it, it is loads of fun.  I recommend a group of at least 4 though	pos

I have been using this mascara for years.  I have tried other brands--drugstore varieties as well as department store varieties and have been disappointed with everything else I have ever tried.  Why?  This mascara is smooth; it does not flake off and fall into your eyes.  It does not ever look clumpy.  It is also easy to remove without losing any eyelashes.  I would not say that this mascara will make your lashes "a mile long" or "dangerously thick" or whatever hype you hear from other brands.  Those kinds only ever look like clumpy mascara.  Just a simple nice, natural looking mascara that won't irritate your eyes	pos
A number of people had told me that this was a very good war movie and one that should be viewed as soon as possible.  Honestly, I was not impressed.  The plot is disjointed and confusing; jumping from the North African Theatre to the European Theatre almost seamlessly, leaving the viewer thoroughly confused.  The character development is also very poor.  No one character stands out due to the fact that Samuel Fuller never allows them to grow or mature by switches between multiple characters too frequently or by not allowing any lengthy dialogue.  Historically speaking this film is a joke.  During the action scenes when the Germans have tanks they are in fact American tanks with the German symbol painted on.  Also, uniforms are sometimes inaccurate.  However, the most annoying aspect is the fact that Samuel Fuller makes it appear as though this squad of men is the ONLY squad fighting the entire war.  Only once or twice do you see any other American troops.  This feeling of isolation detracts from the overall sense of a full scale war, of which these men are supposed to be a part of.  Finally, to make matters worse, the film's action sequences are sometimes imaginative but are often impractical, sloppy, awkwardly placed, and consist of ridiculous situations.   ---  --- Overall this movie was too long, lacked character development for most of the movies characters, was disjointed, and was historically inaccurate.  For a movie that garnered so much hype I was expecting much, much more. ---  	neg

I was unsure of whether to purchase this product when I saw that my printer (HP Deskjet 712C) was not on the list put out by the manufacturer but after reading some others' reviews, I tried it anyway because the price was right.

This is a good alternative to the bombard of Hollywood films. It potrays beutifully and naturally the meaning of love and the loneliness of the elderly. I live in one of the Asian countries where the famili members still have strong emotional bound to one another. Watching this film, I came to realize how lonely one's life can be when one grows old in the so called modern countries. Because things are so modernized, things have got so mechanical, human relation is no exception. This happens to the mother in this film. It is so touchy to see when the mother and the father come to visit her son's family, everybody is so busy with his/her business, everybody is in a rush and in the end the two of them have to stay in a quiet house with nobody around. Their visit is not strong enough to hold people from minding his/her business. --- Her being attracted to the young carpenter is a sign that she actually needs attention and that she is lonely rather than the raw 'love' between a man and a woman. --- I recommend this film to those who love to watch a film about love, family and relationship.	pos
This is not as described..it is very hard to move - heavy and bulky.

I recently purchased the tent cot and decided that it would be best to have the rain fly to go along with it. The rainfly fits snuggly with elastic corners. Also, there are straps that attach to the ends of the cot with clips. The sides tie down in four places to prevent it from flying around when you don't have it fully zipped up. My only gripe and the reason it doesn't get five stars is that I think it should have just come with the tent cot in the first place rather than having to order it separately	pos

This item was fairly easy to assemble.  Would be easier with 2 people but I put it together in less than 30 minutes.  It was easy to mount onto the roof rack as well.  Bought this for a long car trip but wanted to take a trial run with it of about 500 miles round trip. On the trip we ran into some rain and a couple of quick downpours.  The carrier held up well.  I had a couple of drops of water on the inside and that was my fault.  It was obvious that it was from the unused holes in the bottom for attaching it to the roof rack and I forgot to use the covers for those holes.  Overall it help up great and expect it will do well for our trip to Florida	pos
Beautiful gameplay and cinema graphics bring new life to the Valkyrie Epic.  The storyline is every bit as compelling as the original with some new twists.

I must say that I have been really impressed with this product. I tend to have skin that is combo/oily, which results in occasional pimples here and there.

My breakouts have been a non-event, and even if I get a pimple here or there, it's gone in a day. I've even noticed a drastic improvement in those hard-to-eliminate blackheads.

I started with Caesar2 back when it came out. I played it for hours and hours and loved it. When Caesar3 came out I bought that too and loved it even more and spent even more time playing. Both Caesar2 and 3 rarely crashed. Things have changed! ---  --- I'm spending more and more of my time restarting Caesar4 than I am playing it. About 8 out of 10 times that I access the area where you trade with other cities it crashes.

I don't have the fastest machine (AMD 2.1ghz, 512ram, rockin' video card with 256meg of mem) but there are irritating 1 second delays in addition to the crashes. I find the whole game to be difficult to use. This was not the case with Caesar3. ---  --- Unless they issue a patch, I'm done feel frustrated with crashes. Maybe I can dumb down the graphic setting to get rid of the delays. ---  --- My suggestion? Wait for a patch before buying --- or move on. --- - jason --- 	neg
Apparently the difference between a criminal act (theft) and moral redistribution of income is 1) who you steal from (stealing from the wealthy, of course, is moral -- according to Rawls and Bolsheviks), and 2) who receives the loot (the non-wealthy makes it moral), and 3) who commits the act (the state/society, of course also makes theft moral; example - taxation), and 4) your intentions (redistribution of income). To look at this another way, if your neighbor breaks into your house and steals your money, that's a crime (unless your neighbor is poor -- which would then be moral and Justice, according to Rawls' formula). If the community comes into your house and steals from you, it's legal and moral Justice, again, according to Rawls. Because, according to Rawls, if, before you were born, you were to vote with everyone on how physical world society should be structured, you'd vote to have the state guarantee that everyone was equal, or they would be compensated somehow for being born (unjustly) less-equal. How? By compensating those with less by stealing from those with more. So those with more would be like oh, say ... a milk-cow who gets milked to serve those with less. So those with more would become a resource, or state-owned slaves to those with less ... because "society" (the Robin Hoods and Rawls of the world) deemed this as moral Justice. Rawls does not take into account those who are willing to take on risk, entrepreneurs, students of life who work to earn an "A" vs. students who earn an "F". He points out that many people are born into difficult situations through no fault of their own. True. But that does not implicate those within society who are born into better situations as the cause, nor are those who are born into better situations responsible for making up the difference. Forcing the "wealthier" ones to be accountable for the unfairness within life and pay the bill isn't Justice or moral. It would simply be an unjust law. Some people see Rawls' theory as a blueprint for a future generation utopia (like the Bolsheviks envisioned Marxism). I see it as an insane blueprint for slavery, and a powerful dis-incentive for earning personal reward and merit. In a sense, this book is an argument against the individual. It sees the world through a blurred lense where the author only recognizes masses of people -- he doesn't recognize any individuals (unless they were born as victims). Curious. How do you experience life ... as a group-mind (an oxymoron if there ever was one), a collective? Or as a unique, isolated, independent, individual? There should be societal incentives to help each other. Okay. But when it is forced (theft of property always implies force), it is no longer an issue of morality or justice -- it's simply a law. Without personal choice being involved there is no morality as an issue, by definition. Transforming advantaged individuals into mules forced to carry the burdens of the world is a definition of justice for whom? ---  --- 	neg
Like someone else said, I don't have a problem paying for a high quality beauty item that works as it says it does.  Cinnamon buns has a great lather, smells wonderful when you use it, and makes your skin soft.   ---  --- I have used it as a shampoo and the scent lingers a bit longer using it on your hair, but it really doesn't function as well as a shampoo as it does as a shower gel.  For a bubble bath ya have to use so much of it I just can't do it. I find myself counting  the ounces I'm pouring under the faucet and have decided to use it as a treat only. ---  --- The smell doesn't last very long, but have found that it does linger longer if you lather, rinse and repeat, like it says on the bottle.   ---  --- It's a dollar an ounce.....not sure if I'll try any of the other 'flavors' simply because of the cost	pos
I was very pleased with this charger. I was considering a portable charger but was advised that it may not work if the battery is too low. My van would not start after some cold weather and my battery was so low that the interior lights were out. After reading info about other chargers I decided on this one.  I read the directions connected it and it did the job. I called Black and Decker and they were very helpful with any questions I had. This is a small price to pay for the convenience, certainly better then having to call a tow truck. It's portable and lightweight, stores easy.I never charged a battery in my life and I was able to do it	pos

I ordered this shade hoping that it would cover all of my baby when we're out strolling in the sun.  It does a pretty good job; only my son's feet and ankles are exposed when he is reclined (my only beef about the product), but I can cover his little piggies and ankles with sunscreen or shoes with no problem.  I like the fact that the shade protects from UV rays and is easily adjustable.  I leave it on my stroller all the time and can still fold up the stroller with it attached.

The remote has always worked from anywhere in the APT thru 2 walls. I was surprised to get this much range. I have not yet found a spot from which it doesn't work.  To get the best range BE SURE to position the USB RF receiver near the computer as directed. ---  --- With my PC, I'm always playing music.  I also play digital video files that were either taken with my camera or were rented digitally from the Internet.  I have a good graphics card with S-Video TV out.  I got a 50 ft S-Video/Out cable; this connects my PC and TV which are in different rooms.   ---  --- With this remote, I now can play (and control) my entire digital music collection on my home stereo (which is connected to the TV) without being at my PC or be in the same room as my PC.  Also, with this remote, any video that can be played on my PC, (online streaming or local) I can watch and control it (pause, rewind, slow motion, next, FWD) on my TV.   ---  --- My PC/TV has effectively become a powerful media center--Media center PC not needed.    ---  --- There is so much more...  with the remote, I use the mouse from far away (lying in bed or on the couch); there a numerous ways to get creative with this. ---  --- I wish the remote was lighted. Still, the keys are arranged for "touch typing" so to speak.  Another negative, I've noticed that Windows Media Player sometimes crashes when video is launched from within the software that comes with the remote.	pos

I can't discard these songs completely, because they have such potential!

Have always used the regular California Duster.  Time to replace the one I have had for years.  Thought I would try the Extra Large duster.

This step sucks.  If you are used to doing step classes at the gym, you will find it difficult to switch to this smaller step.  I didn't know it was a smaller step or I wouldn't have bought it.  It is hard to adjust to the shorter step, especially when doing a turn step or V step.  It ends up being VERY close to a basic step.  I was so nervous about stepping too close to the end and flipping the whole step up, that I was cheating myself out of a full workout.  DO NOT buy this, if you're used to the step at the club.  I feel like it's more dangerous on this, and ended up doing a lot of the steps on the floor.  If you already know that you like to step, buck up and buy the club size step, even though it is twice the price of this one.  Otherwise, don't buy anything	neg

While the two fans I ordered for a new computer build are functioning properly, they are not as advertised on Amazon's website.

Awhile ago I was having a conversation with someone about musical tastes where we vastly disagreed on what was simply awesome bands and which ones were purely based around taste, such as people who love R&B and Rap to people who prefer Dance. In a way, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, as well as the Exorcist and the Shining are like the Beatles and Led Zeppelin of horror movies: you must love them and say anything different and you're going to get lynched. So I will agree that the film is definately refreshing considering the latest crop of so-called "horror movies", yet at the same time I wonder why it didn't hit me that much. ---  --- 5 kids are travelling through the country and hear of a couple of houses. They decide to check it out only no one's home...seemingly at first. Pretty soon they meet Leatherface, a man in a burlap sac mask who wields a big fat chainsaw. Pretty soon, the kids start going one by one and we find a family seriously depraved and having to escape alive. It's odd how I can't say any more about the plot; not because of spoilers but because there's not a lot else to say. ---  --- Like many a filmgoer, I can't stand the latest releases in horror. Instead of using atmosphere, pacing and mood to creep people out, they go for broke and show some of the more violent scenes. This film isn't even gory at all. In fact, the film's goriest scene, where one of the kids meets a chainsaw, isn't even shown onscreen. Your mind fills in what went on which can probably be even more disturbing. Adding to the realism is that it's shot in a kind of documentary-like style. One problem I had with the film was that the dread didn't feel there. There was pre-MTV style editing and extreme-closeups of eyeballs and maybe I've just seen it before but it didn't creep me out like it should've(and having a woman scream for 20 minutes doesn't help). ---  --- If I saw this in 1974, I mostly likely would've been creeped out of my wits but seeing it 32 years later, it's more like "yeah it was alright although I better not say so cause then everybody will bug me about it". If you're a fan, go ahead and buy it because it's probably the best release of the film but personally, I'm not	pos

Having struggled with digital scales that broke after a few years, I finally decided to get the scale my doctor has.  It's terrific because I can see it clearly (the numbers are right in my face) and it is built to last forever! My daughter and I assembled it with a minimum of effort. The directions are written clearly and all adjustments are super easy to handle. It is clearly the best scale I've ever owned.  The down side is that it needs a bit more space than a regular floor scale.  You can, however, buy a piece of plywood and put the scale on top of the wood in a carpeted room if your bathroom can't handle the bigger size	pos
I bought this camera in Oct 2005. I brought it everywhere. Loved it. In April 2006, the LCD screen blew. Canon replaced it with a refurbished camera. In March 2007, the exact same thing happened to the screen and now they will only repair for $97.00, as they have determined this is the result of impact damage. How they determine this is unclear to me, as it was not dropped or impacted...Apparently, you will spend 100.00/yr maintaining this camera. That, to me, is the hallmark of a faulty product. Unfortunate - as I really loved this camera	neg
-Not a great one here, entertaining for all the wrong reasons, mainly because the film is so bad, so often. ---  --- -It is nice to see Christina Ricci in a movie again, as she's usually good even in a bad movie and doesn't do too bad here. ---  --- -Wes Craven directs this one and I could tell right away it must have been do to a contract obligation (much like Edward Norton in "The Italian Job"). I could tell this because very little effort seemed to be put into the script, both the story and lines of dialogue were very predictable and dumb. Also very little effort seemed to be put into the effects, as they were very lousy at times, especially when they finally showed the werewolf. ---  --- -As I said before, quite predictable the story was, both Ricci and her brother get bitten by a werewolf after they try to save a girl who got into a car wreck. Then both try to figure out what's wrong with them, though the brother is much more active about it than Ricci.  ---  --- -It's also quite obvious who the main werewolf was, the film tries a bit of a swerve, but it doesn't really work.  ---  --- -Besides Ricci, the cast includes Shannon Elizabeth (American Pie 1&2), Portia De Rossi (Arrested Development), Joshua Jackson (Pacey on "Dawson's Creek"), Scott Baio (don't ask me why) among others. All do pretty poor jobs, besides Ricci that is, the rest don't really seem to care, not that I blame them that is. ---  --- -There is some humor throughout the film, but a lot of the film will get unintentional laughs from those who watch it. ---  --- -The only reason to watch this is to make fun of it as the effort is not really there by mostly anybody on the cast or crew. 	neg
I first picked up a copy of Nylon in Chicago, while browsing the newsstands. I wasn't sure if I would like it--years of subscribing to Vogue, Elle, and some stupid tweeny magazines had almost put me off magazine-reading for good. And yet I always manage to be drawn to the racks. ---  --- Nylon was different from the get go. They always feature unknowns on the cover, and when, on occassion, a well-known celebrity is featured, the stories give us a new perspective on them.  ---  --- Nylon is worth purchasing for the layout in itself. I could spend hours paging through each feature, marveling at the graphics, and the way the magazine is put together. I love how they base some of the beauty section on famous movies or bands. ---  --- Nylon also makes a point of covering bands, movies, and fashion designers that, until now, have remained obscure. Everything they feature is amazing--most of the music they recommend ends up on my Amazon wishlist! ---  --- I would highly recommend Nylon to anyone and everyone. This obscure magazine will stun you with its amazing artistic layout, and introduce you to new products you may have never discovered	pos

Below is my experience with this product after owning it for 2 weeks. ---  --- Pros: --- ----- --- 1. Amazing sound especially when watching DVD movies --- 2. Very good progessive scan DVD picture quality --- 3. Simple, compact and all-in-one design --- 4. Remote control can work with various TV's, Cable boxes and VCR's --- 5. Can play both NTSC and PAL DVD's ---  --- Cons: --- ----- --- 1. Expensive --- 2. No HDMI output --- 3. Non-intuative remote control --- 4. No headphone jack ---  ---  --- Overall, I love and chose the Bose 321 because of the sound quality and compact design. I got this system because I wanted a compact all-in-one media center and I was not interested in getting a HTIB with 5 speakers. I looked at Denon (2 products), Sony and Samsung. ---  --- I use this on my 23" Samsung LCD TV using Monster component video cables and while I would have preferred to take advatange of its HDMI capabilties, the reality is that I am very happy with this image quality. Movies such as Lord of the Rings, The Matrix and Hero look and sound fantastic. Prior to this I was looking at the Sony DAV-X1 which is much cheaper and more feature-rich. However the internal turmoils between their consumer electronics and media divisons convince me this would not work for me. For example, my PAL DVDs cannot be played on the Sony whereas on the Bose it was no problem. I am of the opinion that Sony is a directionless company and this is reflected in their products. ---  --- To be fair you do need to have the right kind of room to take advantage of their TrueSpace 2.1 surround sound feature. My couch is up against the wall with the media center located 12 ft in front of me. According to Bose the speakers should ideally be 3 feet away from the TV. Sometimes TrueSpace works and sometimes I can't hear it. I believe this is true among all the other competitors in this market line and that neither one stands out ahead of the other. If surround sound is really that important to you, then you should get a 5.1 system. This product is perfect for a small room as it takes advantage of the echos of the room where it can fake a 3D sound and would probably not be ideal for a family size rec-room. ---  --- The audio quality from music CD's is very good and while I wish this had an iPod port as found on the Denon, I am very content using the Aux port	pos

This is a film like none other you have ever seen, and as such you'll either love it, or hate it. ---  --- From the "reviews" posted on Amazon, I've come to the conclusion that the people who hate it are simply people who don't have the intelligence to have understood a word of it. ---  --- This film is not literal.  Learn to *think* about what you are watching.  To interpret archetypes, symbolism and metaphor. ---  --- A clue: the Lady character is named STORY.  Now why might that be? ---  --- And why would she require a VESSEL before taking flight into the world? ---  --- And what precisely does the wolf-like Scrunt represent? ---  --- And why are there THREE of those monkeys? ---  --- This film is a love letter from one creative person to all other creatives in the world.  If you aren't an artist, you probably won't get it at all, and might even post a scathing review of it on sites such as this.   ---  --- But that achieves nothing but illustrate how stupid you truly are to the artistic souls that will understand everything this film says, and love every beautiful, unique and visionary second of it. ---  --- Magical.	pos

If you look at my review history, you may note that I've given very few five-star reviews. I save five stars for outstanding products. I believe Wordperfect X3 is best described as outstanding. ---  --- A long time ago, I used Word Perfect. However, my earlier jobs required I use MS Word, so I did my best to become a Word guru. I believe I accomplished that short of creating custom macros. As a law clerk, I started a new job where WordPerfect was the standard. ---  --- So, last year I bought WordPerfect 12. At first it was difficult, but I bought a book that helped me fill in the blanks. With the ability to customize keyboards and the fact that WordPerfect gives the author a great degree of control (especially with show-codes), I was soon able to become a WordPerfect guru. I remembered all the things I used to love about WordPerfect. Like any lover, I also learned to ignore some of the blimishes of WordPerfect. (One of those blemishes is the behavior of pushing a change from that point of the document forward, which, once you get accustomed to it, is really a nice feature.) Wordperfect and PDFs are the two accepted file formats for electronic submission to Federal courts. ---  --- There were two complaints I found at work among Word devotees: 1) the ability to export to PDF but not import and 2) the inability to cut from a Word document into a WordPerfect document without creating all the formatting litter Word likes to use. ---  --- 1. We occasionally receive PDFs that we would have to retype to be able to make edits. With the ability to import PDFs (that is, those that were authored and exported into PDF, not documents scanned into PDF), we were now able to edit those PDFs. This was a real time saver. Since PDF is the de facto universal standard amongst all platforms (Windows, Mac, Unix), this was a great improvement. ---  --- 2. Formatting litter is a real pain to deal with. I never could get a MS Word document to just import into WordPerfect without headaches in trying to fix the formatting. My solution was to copy the portion out of MS Word, paste into a text file, copy again and then paste into WordPerfect. My complaint was I could not just straight paste into WordPerfect. Well, Corel heard my cry and provided the ability to copy just the text. The lone MS Word holdout in my office capitulated with that. He has no more to complain about. ---  --- Another great thing about WordPerfect is the fact that the file format for its documents has not changed in years (I heard a WP rep say no change since 1995). Why should it? Everything you could want to do in a document (perhaps barring professional typesetting) can be done in WordPerfect. There's no need to create a new format when the one you have just works. ---  --- This product does exactly what those who have come to love WP expect it to do. I think Corel has done a good job of resolving my own personal quibbles with WP. ---  --- So, if you're looking for a solid performer that seeks to beat competition by improving itself, WPX3 is representative of what you're looking for	pos

If a book makes me look forward to mid-life - I am all over it! This book was actually required reading for my course study in human development - what a find!  Here, Harvard researcher and bestselling author, Joan Borysenko, takes the cycles of a woman's life and divides them into 7 year increments. Along the journey, she also makes a great case for debunking old myths about women and aging.?That's a Big 10-4, Ms. Borysenko! I find myself constantly at odds with the "beauty" images that the media gives us.  I mean, come on, why 'o why are we more often rewarding people for how they look and less for what they contribute to society?   ---  --- Perhaps it's escapism - I tell myself (in effort to sleep at night).  Yet, after reading Borsyenko's, book I'm reminded that, yes, it's good to follow intellectual pursuits. And, yes, there's differences between women and men.  According to Borysenko, women are most often motivated by what they can contribute to society, family, and how to make a difference in the world.  Men tend to define themselves by their work.  Most telling!  Anyhow, I won't give away the store here - but in my opinion, if you are of the female persuasion, you will not want to miss this read.  	pos

I found the film, "Malice" to be a very intriguing and interesting murder mystery. Sure, there are a lot of twist's in the film, however, that is what I found to be very good about this film. Especially the way these twist's were done. There will be no spoilers in this review. The film begin's with murders occuring in a small college town. Andy Safian (Bill Pullman) is a college dean who happens to be suspected of these killings. All circumstantial. Moreover, he is having problems with his wife (Nicole Kidman). Something happens to her, and she blames Andy for this. [To tell you would give away the film] ---  --- It seems as if one of Andy's old school friends is now a practicing surgeon (Alec Baldwin). Therefore she decides to leave him and sues both the medical facility that caused her such grief, and the Doctor (Balwin) in particular who caused this grief to her. But there is more to the story than meets the eye. There are several stories going on at once. First, you have a serial killer, secondly you have a distraught wife (Kidman) blaming her ex-husband and his Doctor friend for what has happened to her. But there is more to her than the viewer suspect's. I will leave this to you to discover. The film is better than the reviews warrant. It is a very suspenseful film full of twists. Recommended!  	pos

This review covers the FB11NR: same unit with slightly different control pushbuttons and with an IR remote. ---  --- Somehow, i had deluded myself into thinking that the spinning massagers under each foot were powered. Nope... basically just built-in plastic versions of those usually wooden massaging rollers that one rolls one's foot upon. That's fine, yet when i want to relax, i'm not thinking about moving my feet. Fortunately, those are removable, and removal is exactly what happened. ---  --- The killer was that the center massage wheel, which IS supposed to be powered and IS supposed to spin, was D.O.A. This unit went back to the store, and we bought an FB21 instead. Amazon has no listing for that model, so i can't give a full review on it. It was good enough to keep. ---  --- Both the FB11NR and the FB21 share some traits. Neither one really keeps water anywhere near its original temperature. Sound levels vary from fairly quiet to quite loud, depending upon the operating mode chosen (i did dB measurements on the FB21, but since Amazon doesn't list that one, you don't get to see them). The FB21 seems to have slightly better build quality, and everything worked out of the box, so we kept that one	neg
I never received this product so I can not review it.  I ordered it through AMAZON.COM and they never sent the magazine.  DO NOT ORDER MAGAZINES THROUGH AMAZON.COM.  I called customer service and being re-routed several times I finally spoke to a customer service agent who said the magazine is on its way. That was two weeks ago and I still have not received any copies of the magazine.  DO NOT ORDER THROUGH AMAZON.COM.  Order all magazines directly through the publisher or any other way.  AMAZON.COM was a terrible experience.  If I ever recieve the magazine I am sure the first issue will show that I started receiving the magazine at the order date so I will have to fight with them to have my subscription end with the my first delivered magazine	neg
I pronate and the light eight material gave me breathability as well as a sturdy base for my running.  I not only trained up to 40 miles a week with these but I ran two half marathons and the NYC Marathon with this exact sneaker.  When they became worn from the wear and tear?  I bought another pair - exact one.  These sneakers lasted me half a training season PLUS the marathon.  Not ages of running but probably close to 200 miles.  I highly recommend them.

This game is fun to play but not the greatest game either. Of course the movie is way better than the game. The game is pretty easy and is short considering there are 18 levels. The storyline in the beginning could have been alittle better as well. Some of the missions are pretty hard but after you pass the tough ones it just gets easy again. All in all it's a good game. I would recommend it. The graphics are good , I do like how they put some storyline in from the movie. It's not to bad of a game to play.	pos
I would spend a little more money and buy a better quality camera. The picture quality was not good at all. I previously owned another Kodak camera with the same Megapixels and the picture quality on that camera was much better. Just after a year of using the Kodak C300 camera, it stopped working and I did not use it that much. I now own the Sony Cybershot DSC-W50 that takes great pictures, I haven't had any problems with it and I have been using it on an almost daily basis since May 2006	neg
It was just what I wanted--a relatively stress-free low-impact workout that you can do while zoning out in front of the tv. Takes about 30 minutes to put together. It's quiet, stowable, and fun.

The swing was easy to install and I did not need extra tools or help.  Unfortunately the tree branch was not exactly horizontal and so it was difficult to make the swing horizontal.  It was even enough, however, and I put my daughter in.  The swing was tilting a little far forward but I could not adjust it.  The worst part was getting her out.  The tray was near IMPOSSIBLE to undo from its locked position.  I guess I did not need to worry about her falling out, I was just wondering if I would be able to get her out at all.

I have read Baldacci's first four novels and have immensely enjoyed all of them.  This one, however, is just awful.  Not only the character's dialogue but even the story itself is written like a really bad detective movie.  The only thing I can think of to compare it to is this :  There was a series of Calvin and Hobbes cartoons where Calvin imagines himself as a private detective and they are written like the old detective shows, with lame lines like "The gun was loaded, and so was I".  That is exactly what this book is like, except it goes on for 400 pages.  There isn't a single interesting character in this book, in my opinion.  You just have to slog your way through the book to get to the end.  It's the Bataan Death March of novels.  I hope this is an aberration - I'll certainly give him another try since the first four novels that I read were so good.  But one more stinker like this one and I'll drop his name from my reading list	neg
great casting, dancings and performance. well, if you keep abusing yourself, nobody can save you. this so talented broadway genius simply couldn't himself to mess up many women's lives and stubbornly doing harm to himself, chain-smoking, addicting to prescriptioned drugs, sleeping around, hopping from one woman to another. he created so many personal disasters around himself, dedicated himself to broadway musicals but never took care of himself. burning his own life candle from both ends day and night. when the curtain in the theatre falls, it would go up again in the next evening, but when the curtain of your life decides to come down on you, it won't go up again. a wonderful movie with a hidden warning lesson to those who in the entertaining show biz	pos

This Eeyore is so much fun.

Simple. It loads like a blaze. Sure all the new frills and features like easy annotations are neat, but the speed of 7.0 alone makes it worth every dime. Especially if your current Acrobat is the half-baked clunky 6.0.x that burst through the gates before it had legs.	pos
FROM AMAZON.CA --- --------- ---  --- The Action Replay MAX is more than just a video game enhancer (VGE)....or at least it claims to be. My version is quite old yet but it claims to include a Region-free DVD player and a memory card compression utility (squeeze more saves onto your memory card). I have not used either of these features personally, but I have heard horror stories about the memory manager corrupting gamesaves and whole memory cards; some reusable, some permanently damaged. This and the fact that you must load up the action replay software to access saves that use the memory manager turned me off of using it. However, the real reason I bought the ARMax was for its codes and I'll get to those in a second. ---  --- The ARMax, like the newer Gamesharks, loads its software from a CD. This is a major annoyance for me. Every time you load a game you must insert the ARMax memory card (which does I don't know what) and CD, go sit on the couch and wait for the software to load, choose your codes, then get up and put the actual game DVD in and wait for it to load. You can't simply turn on your PS2 and go sit down. In the old days of cartridge gaming you would snap the VGE between the game and the console so you could turn on the console and go sit down. The early generation Gamesharks had a little box that would attach to an expansion slot on the PS1 or N64 and that was it. If you wanted it to load before the game, you turned on its switch. Even if the ARMax was perfect in every other way (and it's not, btw), it would get a maximum of 4 stars as long as you had to boot it from a CD first. I mean, why can't the memory card part of it at least hold the codes for even just the current game you're playing after the system is shut off or reset so you don't have to load the software EVERY D@MN TIME. ---  --- Ok, rant over. On to the codes. The user interface for the ARMax is better than the Gameshark. Functionally, they are very similar of course, but the ARMax just feels cleaner and easier to use. It offers a Beginner interface that includes descriptions of code functions (not for user-entered ones though, if I remember right), and a more robust Expert Mode. On big advantage, in theory, that the ARMax has over the Gameshark is its ability to update itself using your PS2's broadband connection. The upshot is you can download new codes for your favorite games fairly quickly instead of manually typing them all in using the controller. The dark cloud to go with this silver lining is that you have no control over which codes you download; its all or nothing. And since these updates are stored on your memory card (not the ARMax one), it will quickly fill up with codes and gamesaves for games 99% of which you will NEVER play! No wonder the ARMax has the option to come with 16 or 32MB of space on its memory card. It's to store all the useless codes! Any entered codes you choose to apply will either work, do nothing, or lock up the game. I have come across all, though to ARMax's credit, mostly the former. The absurd choice forcing you to download and save updates for every game in the PS2 library, when you may want just one, loses the ARMax another star. A note about manually entering codes: The sub-headings and folders for a game have their own codes that must be entered if you want them to show up in the game's code list. ---  --- Finally, as mentioned in the reviews by Bret Morris and Glenn Nichols (Amazon.ca), the ARMax initially did not work with the new revision of the fat PS2 a couple years ago AT ALL. This happened for me as well. I returned three PS2s and two ARMaxes before I realized it was a defect in all current versions (at the time) of ARMax. I had to send away and get a new disc direct from Intec which now works as well as expected. Since the ARMax has been on shelves for several years since I bought mine, I assume any bought today would not have this problem. However, at the time there was no way to find out about this problem without contacting Intec personally. Retailers were not aware of the problem and no notices were posted on the CodeJunkies web site. This inadequate treatment of a widespread problem drops ARMax down to two stars. ---  --- In my opinion, if you're in the market for a VGE, both ARMax and Gameshark have their pros and cons. I would assume both have released newer versions with newer features than the ones I have. Looks at the specs, assume nothing, and don't be afraid to e-mail the companies requesting details regarding any features you have questions about. ---  --- I apologize for the length of this review, but I find there are very few in-depth reviews of VGEs on the web or in print. Maybe reviewers feel they are above using VGEs, I don't know.	neg
I bought these because they are described as: "100% all-natural dry roasted almonds".  Now I read the label states that these contain: maltodextrin, modified potato starch, sugar, MSG, autolyzed yeast extract, modified corn syrup solids, modified corn starch, salt...     --- 	neg
I went to a sports store and all they carried were sportline pedometers.  I really didn't know which one to buy so I bought this one because it was more attractive than the bright yellow one and it was more expensive than the 340 so I thought it was better somehow.  Even though it says that it measures steps accurately on the packaging, it doesn't actually display it.  It only uses it to calculate the distance that you've walked.  I was very annoyed by this because the 340 does track and display the number of steps walked.  I got over it but the thing keeps resetting in my pocket.  I'm just going to buy another pedometer.  One that displays the steps walked and has a cover	neg
Whether William Golding deserved Nobel Prize or not is still a debatable point, but it is true that he wrote one marvelous book, and its name is `Lord of the Flies.' But let's not talk about the differences between the book and the film for a while - because after all no one I am afraid can bring the multi-layered world of words onto the screen. Even those who loved the 1963 version would admit that. You can interpret the meaning of `Lord of the Flies' but who can really visualize it, or the imaginary conversations of Simon for that matter? ---  --- The biggest problem of Harry Hook's new version is not the changes done to the film. The boys are American military school cadets, using dirty words frequently, but those parts didn't annoy me much. Real problem is something more essential to the film, which is storytelling. In short the 1990 film doesn't know what it wants to be. On the film's video cover you can read (and I quote) `this stunning adventure explores the deep dark corner of the human soul." Well, not exactly. ---  --- For as adventure story it lacks pace; the film always feels rushed and often needs better editing. As allegory it needs more distinctive personalities for each character. The conflict between Ralph and Jack should be clearer, and Piggy's role should be more than that of a whining fat boy. And don't forget Simon, who sees things, it is true, but definitely not those things that the film actually shows us. ---  --- It is a pity that the cinematography is so beautiful. It could have been a perfect backdrop against which dark allegorical survival story would develop, opposite of optimistic tales of Jules Verne's adventure stories. By watching this film you can follow the story of the book, but find no tension or thought-provoking words in it. ---  --- Balthazar Getty's feature film debut. And Lewis M. Allen, one of the producers of the film, had also produced Peter Brook version in 1963	neg
My husband and I got these headphones for his 9-year old son who lives in Ocala, Florida. He loves them. They aren't too heavy, and really allow him to listen carefully.

They took some getting used to, but after three weeks, he's doing very well, and doesn't even notice that he has them on	pos

I've had a ton of these, and I take them on camping trips with kids where the main activity is playing in big mud fields.  I've had them in my pocket while rolling around in the mud, taken it out, shot a few pics, put it back in the pocket with no problem.  (See pictures for examples of "mud photos") ---  --- A couple of times I've had them stand up to so much moisture and abuse that the cardboard falls off, but still had beautiful pictures every time, no jams or over-exposures.   ---  --- I've found the two pack at WalMart on sale for $8.99 a couple of times, and you absolutely cannot be that deal.  ---  --- This is my favorite disposable camera, and I've tried them all.	pos
Coming from a listener with a broad scope of musical preferences, Blues has always been a multi-faceted genre which can be broken down into the categories:Soulful Blues, Drinking Blues and Guitar Blues. "B.B King - Live At The Regal" is one of those recordings that just happens to capture all three. ---  --- This recording is dear to my heart as I can remember far back as first or second grade when my grandmother (God Bless) used to play this on 8-track. She used to love herself some Riley "Blues Brother" King. This recording ALWAYS seemed to be in the player when my cousins and I would come over to visit and rest assured, You WILL hear it before you left to go home. ---  --- At that time, Being the young naive kid that I was, I remember saying that I hated it and that it was old folks music. All grown up now, In an age where real music is practically unheard of in terms of what these young artists of today release on CDs, I have a newfound respect for real stuff like this. So instead of sitting around burning your brain cells trying to understand what this new generation is calling itself creating, You have decided to come to one of the first sources for good old fasioned real music....The Blues. ---  --- In my opinion, "BB King Live At The Regal" is one of Mr. King's best recordings and with myself not being a big fan of live albums, This is one of those rare live pieces that captures the essence of what a live recording should sound like. Maybe not so much in terms of the musicianship but the overall performance of those involved. The arrangements were put together nicely & the musicians were all in a very tight vibe on this album and whoever was on the mixing board did an excellent job of capturing this essence. BB's pickin' and crooning mixed with the superb playing by the band make this a wonderful place to start for the blues or BB King enthusiast.  ---  --- It sounds as if it was made in a tasteful nightclub full of grown people who wanted to hear good music while having a good time. The ladies were screaming and the gentlemen were cheering and BB was playing at his best. The only gripe I have about this disc is that it is very short; which was typical considering the age and time that it was made but still essential and a solid lesson for anyone interested in Blues (especially Blues Guitar). I recommend getting this and BB's "Live In Cook County Jail". They both are live albums and both have some of the same songs on them but they were done in a different way and should still be heard. ---  --- Good choice if you get this one.  	pos

After trying just about every other pricier wiper blade on the market, and being disappointed every time, I decided to spring the extra money for this one (no, they are not cheap) and see if paying the extra money made all that much of a difference. I only bought one initially, on a rainy day when my driver side wiper had flown off the car on my way to work, and then immediately ran back and got one for the passenger side, too, after I'd only gone a mile down the road. These wipers are incredible. I swear my windshield looks better now than it ever has. No smearing, no streaking, and complete water removal. They also work better at removing bugs from the windshield in conjunction with the car window washer fluid than any other wiper I've ever used. Now I'm curious about the longevity of the wiper blade. I'm hoping they last longer than others, too (given the price.	pos
There is no better way to drive home T.S. Eliot's "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" than to hold a peach and read: ---  --- "Shall I part my hair behind? Do I dare to eat a peach? [CHOMP] --- I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach." --- (And shall I dare yet again to eat a peach and teach?) [MUNCH MUNCH] --- "I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each." --- (But I do not care to preach; I only dare to eat a peach.)

Karaoke Revolution Party is a fantastic game with great songs, great easy gameplay and perfect party game features. If you've never tried a karaoke game, now's the time to play. ---  --- First, the basic setup. You get to FULLY customize your character. We're talking black, white, male, female, heavy, skinny, athletic. Then you go for hair styles, hair colors, outfits down to the shoes and jewelry. You can evey use your EyeToy to scan your FACE onto the face of the character. It is simply amazing. ---  --- Then we go onto the song list. I own probably every karaoke game out for the 3 main systems. I love karaoke games. This song list is by far my favorite song list of all time - and it's true for my boyfriend as well. There are a good mix of jumping songs, slow romantic songs, rocking songs and more.  ---  --- In other karaoke games you have to go through unlocking the venues and songs. Because this is a party game, they pretty much give you everything up front, with a few exceptions. You do unlock a few songs and a ton of characters / outfits as you go, to keep things interesting. A few standouts include the Elvis outfit and the cat outfit. ---  --- In addition to being able to sing along in both single player and duet modes, there are a bunch of fun mini-games. You can compete against other players, try to play note-matching games and even set up the eye toy so you see your own background in the game.  ---  --- Even better, if you have a dance pad, you can sing and dance at the same time! This is REALLY great for building up your vocal powers. Many people can sing fine if they stand still like a stick, but when you sing in a band you're actually expected to move around and dance. Using the dance pad helps you build up your lung power and timing so that you get those skills. Even if you're not in a band, you can see the challenges that your favorite singers face. ---  --- This game is a TON of fun both with friends in party mode, or just singing along yourself with the songs. Where some of the previous versions of karaoke sometimes had "questionable" versions of songs, with them being obviously different from the original, these songs are great sounding and many times I didn't have to look at the song bar at all to sing along with them. ---  --- Highly, highly recommended!! ---  --- Rating: 5/5 ---  --- NOTE: The previous reviewer says this has the Aretha Franklin version of Natural Woman. I'm rather sure it's the Carole King version	pos
This Pur Minerals Starter Kit is a great introduction to this brand.  I am absolutely in love with the 4-in-1 Pressed Mineral Makeup (included in the kit). It's so much better than the Bare Escentuals makeup, which I had been using for years. The 4-in-1 provides great coverage, as it is a foundation, concealer, and spf 15 pressed powder all in one. With Bare Escentuals, I was having to buy the mineral veil, foundation and concealer all separately, and I still felt like my dark circles and blemishes were not covered well. Pur Minerals is a wonderful makeup, very lightweight, and even the brush is soft on my skin! I highly recommend it	pos

I am a Friends fan and I really enjoyed this game. The questions vary in difficulty, and the narration by the characters is a nice feature. ---  --- Regarding the issues with the keyboard, the keys for each player are indeed very close together. Also, when two players can answer the same question at the same time, it's easy to press the wrong key by mistake. But I guess in time you can get used to the keys. ---  --- I didn't have a problem installing the game, although I have a CD recorder and recording software installed. I didn't choose the full instalation, since the CD has to be in the drive anyway, but the game runs properly, it didn't seem to freeze when reading from the CD. ---  --- Compared to SceneIt, it's very different. This is a complete trivia game that keeps score and announces the winner. SceneIt is a board game, and the DVD is used to ask questions, and in order to play it as a trivia game you need to keep score with paper and pen	pos
Save your time, money and patience.  This may be the worst book I have read since the equally monotonous, predictable Stone Barrington novel "The Short Forever".  Wow, this one stinks.  Like others, I put up with the shallow characters, ludicrous dialogue and endless parade of showers, boobs and guns to figure out whodunit.  Unfortunately, this book had an ambiguous ending that seeks to be clever but is instead is just stupid.  Who on earth did kill Vance?  And come to think of it, who gives a damn?  I don't what women did to Stuart Woods but he sure seems to hold them in complete contempt.  Every female character, save for Isabel the maid, felt compelled to practically rape our handsome hero.  Each is flawless and gorgeous but also all are dumb, vacuous, self-centered and thoroughly unlikeable - hey a couple are even truly psychotic!  The only normal female character who spared Stone, Mary Ann, unfortunately has a room temperature IQ.  I am hardly a prude, but I lost count of how many women either Vance or Stone made love to in the course of one short novel and felt the need to take a long hot shower to rid myself of the feelings of filth.  Mr. Woods either lives in a world of complete ignorance or the reading public is a lot less discriminating than I thought	neg

I know a lot of people liked this book, but I felt like it put too much pressure on me to pack on the pounds.  I didn't realise so much of the book was focused on diet.  It says you should plan on gaining a pound a week, and the more you gain the healthier your babies will be.  Well the first 13 weeks I managed to gain NOTHING, and I felt horrible about it, but food made me so sick the last thing I could do was eat MORE food to try to gain weight.  The book said that according to my starting weight I should try to gain 50 - 60 pounds during my pregnancy!  I decided to stop reading the book, and so far, just going by what my gut says about what to eat and when, I've managed to put on 20 pounds.  My twins are measuring perfectly and are very healthy. ---  --- This book isn't horrible, but I would check it out of a library or borrow it or buy it used, don't spend the $ on a new one... and be prepared to put it down if it doesn't sound right to you	neg
This is one of the many different magazines that you can find at discount or grocery stores with lots of hairstyle pictures. They are usually seasonal meaning 4-5 issues a year. This particular magazine is mostly black & white pictures. At least the issues I've bought were. This is something you would buy if you wanted a new hairstyle that would involve a new cut. A majority of the styles in these magazines are shoulder length styles and above. This is a nice item to have in a hair salon for clients to get ideas while they wait	pos
The "Urban Legend" franchise has been pretty steady for the past couple of years. I just don't understand why this movie was made. It shifts from the slasher feel of the previous two movies and delves into a more supernatural focus. The film is pretty bad. I'm definitely a huge fan of horror movies and it doesn't take a lot to impress me but this was just mediocre.  ---  --- The acting is extremely sub-par and this is especially disappointing because Kate Mara is in the cast. She delivered some pretty good roles in "Nip/Tuck" and "Jack & Bobby" but she goes through this movie, along with the rest of the actors in an incoherent storyline that shifts from scene to scene with no depth. It's hard to care about the characters at all. They just float around with seemingly no purpose. I even almost quit watching the movie halfway but being the avid horror fan I am, I had to continue.  ---  --- There is only one really cool death scene that gave this movie 1 star. It involves a pretty girl and a spider. Most of the rest of the death scenes are just retreads of urban legends the characters talked about in the past two movies. The film even has a cameo scene from "Final Cut" in which a character is watching a porn on the TV.  ---  --- Overall, not even worth a rental. Luckily for me, I didn't have to waste 3 bucks because it was available for free on my Comcast ON Demand.	neg

I saw this at a friends house--so thank God I didn't pay any money to see this bit of idiocy.  I can only assume any good review you read was written by someone with a financial stake in the film!

Xitel INport Deluxe does what it says it does.  You can plug in any RCA AUX connector into the unit and with the software provided you can record it in stereo to your computer. ---  --- It's a good solid product that does what it says it does but instead of focusing on the features like other reviewers I will point out its minor drawbacks. First, audacity, the a free software that is mentioned in the manual has a tendency to freeze up while recording with the unit.  However, I don't know if it will freeze up on your computer.  Second, if you are thinking about buying this product to turn LPs to CDs, into most LP players don't have RCA AUX plugs and you'll need to buy an addapter.   --- (What they don't tell you in the manual is that if you do this you first need to adjust the volume on the stereo and recorder volume in parallel which is kinda tricky.) Finally, the manual could use more detail because some of the important features weren't mentioned.    ---  --- If you don't mind these drawbacks, you will be able to have many years of recording pleasure if you buy this product	pos
I bought this for my daughter's 1st birthday after seeing an ad for the entire set of Chicco Happy Garden products.  My daughter loves the Little Tikes set that is at her daycare and this looked similar but much cuter.  The eggplant has been a bit of a disappointment.  She would sit on it and rock for a few seconds at first but would quickly lose interest.  Now that we have had the eggplant for 3 months, it has been completely shoved aside.  It just doesn't rock much.  I can't imagine a child over 1 wanting to play with it.  The eggplant has very little curve to it and is pretty boring. I would stick to the Little Tikes set.  	neg
This is a well done game, especially if you liked the movie.  Characters voices and behavior are consistent with the movie and there's a cute storyline to the game. ---  --- There are a number of stages that you follow in order, completing one to move to the next. ---  --- There's a pretty small age window that its good for -- I'd say about 6 to 10.  Under 6, the stages are too hard.  Over 10 they're sort of easy and not that engaging -- you can fly thru pretty quickly. ---  --- It would be a bit better if you could jump around and play the "games" that you enjoy instead of having to go sequentially, but it's still well done and worth buying	pos
(this review is of the Spyware edition) --- NIS takes 25Megs of ram - ok for an all-in-one (if you have <256Megs your lightweight CPU can't carry enough armor to make Windows really Zero-day Net safe IMHO) ---  --- NIS has most of the features I look for in a firewall/spyware/virus scanner/intrusion detector, BUT  --- half don't work right, and some that do seem to fight every attempt to make them work. ---  --- Even after LiveUpdate this week, --- One buggy automatic firewall rule autoloaded, and port 80 was open listening half 'naked' on the Internet. --- I replaced it, and at the first passing probe my rule was erased, autoreplaced, naked again. --- Only after I stumbled onto the secret trick (add a block all rule after the pass rules) did it close it. --- It took 11 clicks (!) just to add the block all rule - miserable! --- The log is a nightmare - pages of long sentences explaining "permitted once" 200 times, no actual info ---  until I click on one of them. What's worse is, none of them I checked WERE "permitted once" IIRC. ---  --- NIS detected 2 trojan/spywares, but could not remove either. ---  --- Enabling program component monitoring started an avalanche of popups, all suggesting I block access, but I actually DO want IE to access the internet.  --- Running Windows update brought a popup asking if 100's more dll's are ok. How would I know? I do want Windows updated.  --- Great feature in theory, totally useless even if you know the names of every evil dll not yet invented. ---  --- If you have more than 1 or 2 programs not in the automatic ruleset, plan to either "permit all" or spend many hours actually writing the same set of 3 rules over and over for every autoupdating program you use - assuming you understand TCP vs UDP etc. Why no "permit all local + DNS + outbound port 80" choice? That would mean 1/10 the work! Jetico lets me pick "web browser" ruleset, so its UI from Hell gets used once per category. ---  --- After spending all day and half the night getting it working, I discover that it is not possible to save my precious rules - or to reload them. I would be less furious if I had a fresh install of windows, but not much. ---  --- All good, until a program autoupdates, and 3 more rules to write. Too angry for words. --- Jetico lets me clone the old rules or edit them to update the program sig. ---  --- I would not use NIS if you paid me 10 times its price.	neg

What pushed me over was when I switched to using Outlook as my email client, accessing quite a few POP3 email accounts for various websites.

Finally!  I've been looking for a good bust enhancer for several years. These enhancers are well-shaped and incredibly comfortable.  When ordering, go ahead and get the B/C size.  Even if you are an A or low-B. These inserts are a little heavy and require a good bra to conceal and hold them up. I personally recommend using a Fashion Forms pocket bra style 9400 or a Playtex style 4300.  Order a cup size above what you would normally wear.	pos
Well, it is a cool product, and good idea to use. But the bulb was broken in first 3 days. We put the second one on. Dont know how long this second one will last.

I bought these shoes a few months ago because I liked the style of them. I wore them just about everyday. A couple of people started telling me "you walk kind of funny in those shoes". They caused my ankles to turn in.I was having ankle pain and my doctor confirmed it was from the shoes. The support (curves) of the shoes are poorly designed. I ran into another women wearing them and walking the same way. I asked her about them and she said she too was having ankle pain. I contacted the company who said I could mail them to the company (at my expense) and they would "inspect" them. If they felt it was a "manufacturers defect" they would replace them with the SAME product. Little good that would do. ALSO If they felt it was not a defect they would just send them back with a note explaining their decision.Don't waste your money and cause yourself pain too. The company may say "they stand by their merchandise" but they don't mean it!	neg

What a horrendous experiment in comedy...if you like Jerry Lewis, I guess you'll love this travesty of a film.  If you are a film snob, you will love it.  Personally, as neither, I am grossly disappointed and just really didn't get "the joke."  It was trite and dull....there was no point....the plot...technology encroaching on humanity....well, good try, but again not for me.  If I am looking for a laugh, I will watch a good Coen brothers film	neg
For years I used PowerQuest's Drive Image 7 for backups. It's rock solid and totally dependable. When Symantec aquired PowerQuest they rolled the underlying technology of Drive Image 7 into Norton Ghost. The result is a very capable and reliable package that can backup partitions or entire drives and also provides support for incremental backups. Most importantly, like Drive Image 7, it provides for emergency recovery of your system. Just boot from the Ghost CD and restore the backup (restore point) that you select. I've tested this process by making both full system backups and subsequent incremental backups, and then restoring the system from those backups. The process works flawlessly. If you need to restore to a different physical drive (replaced a failed drive, etc), the process requires a few extra selections, but is still very straightforward. Just take the time to read the manual. ---  --- I've seen Acronis True Image recommended by some both here and elsewhere. I've tried Acronis and find it lacking in one major respect: It simply is not reliable. During trials, I made backups with Acronis. Acronis indicated that the backups were successful but, when attempting to make a system recovery just minutes later, Acronis indicated that the backups were corrupted and could not be used. The backups were worthless. ---  --- When purchasing backup software remember that bells and whistles don't count for anything. The only thing that counts is reliability. It must be able to reliably restore your system. Norton Ghost passes that test with flying colors. --- 	pos
I enjoy this mouse. Usually, I don't like using the touch pad on laptops but after deciding to buy a mouse, I had to look for a specific mouse that would fit into my lifestyle as a student. I have small hands and I hate carrying out heavy objects in my bookbag. Since I have to lug my laptop around, I needed a mouse that didn't take a lot of space, is good enough to withstand constant shifting in my laptop, and that worked well with my needs. ---  --- Pros: Small size, optical, scrolling tab, and portability --- Cons: Sometimes the mouse jumps around a bit on its own. BUT this happens only a few times every few weeks - so it's not often enough to cause a problem for me. ---  --- Enjoy	pos
No doubt about it.  This book covers the history of the Border Patrol.  However, it falls far short of what it ostensibly bills itself and ends up more as a "fluff piece" than anything else. ---  --- As someone who has not only served as a Senior Border Patrol Agent (13 years) but also a Border Patrol union president and outspoken critic of the agency, I have studied this agency inside and out without the affects of tunnel vision that typically accompany the job (many say a necessity).  Pacheco, as an active agent (when he wrote the book at least), appears headed in the right direction with the book and then suddenly veers off target.  His somewhat ambiguous message that border security is a difficult task is obviously an attempt to straddle the line (I apologize for the pun) so as not to appear too contentious or controversial.  Did he need to seek agency approval for publication since he was actively employed?  If so, then the credibility issue leaps out and the book is worth the historical content alone if nothing else.  If he did not need agency approval and was truly writing without restraint, then he failed to accurately convey the real state of the Border Patrol and border security.   ---  --- Simply put, the Border Patrol, as with most of the Homeland Security subcomponents is disintegrating.  Remember the incompetence of FEMA (a Homeland Security subcomponent)?  Well, multiply that incompetence times ten.  Heard about the poor morale of FEMA employees?  Multiply that problem by one-hundred and you have an accurate picture of the Border Patrol.  A Border Patrol in which the vast majority of otherwise employable agents spend ninety-percent of their time trying to get out.  Those that choose to stay in do so only because of the comparatively worse off agencies in DHS.  The bottom line is that as a former agent, I lose sleep at night knowing what I know.    ---  --- Pacheco did cover the rigorous training regimen accurately even if it bordered on propaganda.  That alone may attract candidates to the difficult and completely unrewarding position of U.S. Border Patrol Agent.  The field stories are completely unappealing to anyone who served more than a week in a law enforcement position unless they are reading about their own exploits.   ---  --- Read the book for enjoyment and homage.  Just don't expect critical analysis.  In fact, this book would be an enjoyable read at Stewarts Bridge (for you IB agents in San Diego).	neg
We have the Baby Bjorn Step Stool, Potty Chair, Little Potty, and now the Toilet Trainer. Hind sight is 20/20. The Toilet Trainer and Step Stool is all you need. Our initial thought was to have the Potty Chair for home and the Little Potty for trips. The reality is our daughter would sit on her potty then want to sit on the toilet like Mommy and Daddy. We balanced her on the toilet before we decided to get the toilet trainer. No more balancing acts on the toilet. She can use her step stool to get on the Toilet when she wants. The toilet trainer travels well, fits all types of toilets, easy to install, remove, and clean! The Potty Chair and Little Potty are fantastic quality but you might as well go with the Toilet Trainer from the start	pos

Reviewer Alianore's opinion "Rather too indulgent of its subject" is a very accurate portrayal of Weir's work. I will try to add something to that near perfect review. (Note: I listened to the unabridged audiobook of "Queen Isabella", 22 hrs on 18 CDs). ---  --- The first half or so of this biography is mostly enjoyable, loaded with period details. The last third is the worst: Weir's fawning dedication to a glorious rehabilitation -- nay, elevation -- of Queen Isabella to the role of long-suffering, much-wronged, highly-deserving, and late-redeemed Just Queen of England. ---  --- This book is really "subjective, rhetorical biographal dramatization". I do not consider it to adhere to an academic standard for objective history and analysis. It is rhetoric because of the endless "weasel words" (and expressions) used copiously throughout: "Some say", "It has been said", "Many believe", "Therefore we may assume", "It can be inferred" ... this isn't just an attribute of her style ... it *is* her style comprehensively. These expressions occur many hundreds of times, commonly in conjunction with Wier's subjective analyses that present her beloved Isabella in the best possible light, always giving her every benefit of the doubt and shifting negative interpretations onto other persons. ---  --- Equally irksome is Weir's double-standard of historical psychological analysis. She is always 'declaring' for us the contents of Isabella's thoughts. Remarkable gift she has for this. Many times Weir reasonably states that modern psychological and socialogical interpretations of medieval history are inherently invalid or at least not meaningful. But then moments later she will portray Isabella's actions from a 21st century point of view ... always telling the reader how Isabella must have, might have, could have, would have been thinking and feeling about one situation after another ... often presented in a positive way that is only supported by a present-day psychosocial interpretation of 800 year old history. This isn't historical writing, it is historical op-ed, with an obvious agenda. ---  --- I don't loathe this work, it is enjoyable in many parts for its color characterizations and depth of detail. The narrator of the audio book has a wonderful voice and good pacing. But this is highly flawed in its editorial approach to historical biography. (Other egregious examples of such hagiography include Edmund Morris' "Rise of Theodore Roosevelt" and "Theodore Rex". I could not complete either of those since Morris is so obviously enthralled by his subject, lovingly lionizing him in every sappy sentence. Yuck. Really.) ---  --- If prefer more history when reading (or listening to) history. And much, much less editorial subjectivity, retroactive psychology, biased interpretation and rhetorical postulation. The only way I could enjoy "Isabella" by Weir is to accept her bias up front and listen accordingly, taking it with "several pounds of salt" as the above referenced reviewer advises. ---  --- 2.5/5	neg

This is by far my favorite version of this classic story and the most authentic and true to the spirit of the book.  The cast and direction are excellent and the setting is gorgeous.  This film will delight both children and adults with it's adventure, suspense, and innocent romance.  It's a little spooky in some scenes, but of the fun rather than truly scary kind.  This story has a very positive underlying message but doesn't preach, rather it expresses it in subtly beautiful ways as the characters unlock the mysteries of the Secret Garden and of themselves.   No matter what age you are, this is a thoroughly enjoyable, uplifting, perhaps even transformative film - don't miss it	pos
a lot of people seem to snub their noses at Let's Talk About Love because it wasn't the career-defining album as the album that preceded it, but all in all, it's still a fantastic snapshot for Celine's career in 1997. ---  --- Celine shocked almost everyone by releasing a follow-up so shortly (Falling Into You was still in the top 40 on the charts at the time) but it was very worthy. ---  --- Among my faves on the album include "The Reason", "Immortality" with The Bee Gees (for a "Celine-less" version of the song, check out The Bee Gees' 2-disc hits collection from 2001), "Love Is On The Way", the very funky "Treat Her Like A Lady", "To Love You More" and the beautiful singalong title track.   This album also housed "My Heart Will Go On" which certainly helped push this album to sales over 9 million.   While it was a song that you wanted to smash the stereo at the time because it was being played every five minutes, I'd say enough time has passed that once again you can enjoy and appreciate this beautiful, powerful ballad. ---  --- With "Falling Into You" and this album, Celine was the #1 female artist for a period, becoming a superstar right as Mariah was abandoning AC for r&b, as Alanis was going on hiatus for awhile, and when Shania was taking off but hadn't yet exploded into major-superstardom.  Love her or malign her (it seems fashionable to do the latter), she became one of the premier voices in Adult Contemporary and won over a large audience.  I haven't been a fan at all of her last few albums, but if she ever comes back with an album like these two, I'd snatch it up in a heartbeat	pos
 I bought this sweet little thing because I am planning a day in NYC and don't want to bring along my regular camera, which is bulky. This camera is nice and small and would fit in any purse or coat pocket. It has 5 MP and a 3X optical zoom which is great for the price. The pictures I took outside turned out outstanding. Inside pics were a bit pixelated, but I may have had the settings wrong. The camera is easy to use right out of the box. ---  --- Perfect for a second camera to keep on you just in case	pos
My kids (age 5, 7 and 10) love this movie.  I actually bought the VHS version many years ago when the movie first came out but wanted the DVD so we could watch it in the car when while traveling.  My husband and I originally bought this movie for my little nephew to watch so it's nice that we can share it with our own kids now.  If you love animals, this movie is for you.  The DVD jacket says this movie took a few years to make and I believe it.  It's absolutely amazing how the animals relate to each other.  This has got to be one of the best animal films out there. 	pos
I wouldn't call this a "rocker seat" The kick-stand on it makes it look like a rocker, if you put the stand down..the legs almost touch the floor. You can make it move a little if you have wood floors, but not enough to call it a rocker. If you have a very mellow baby, this chair is perfect. My baby likes to sit and stare at the toys. But if you need any type of movement for your baby to stay calm, I wouldn't recommend this chair. ---  --- The music/sounds on it is very nice, not annoying at all. I don't use the vibration on it yet, until my baby can itch his cheeks if needed. The only reason I say 4 stars and not 5 is because it is falsely advertised as a "rocker", other than that, it is very cute, and my baby enjoys it alot!	pos
Lead singer and co-founder David Gates was recently inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.  This album is one prime example of why.  David has consistently provided beautiful melodies with easy, sensitive lyrics.   His last album was a country album called "Love Is Always  Seventeen," which was a genre-crossing mix of pop and country,  co-produced and performed with Billy Dean.  But back to this gem.   "Guitar Man," and "Aubrey" were the big hits off of  this album, and they still stand the test of time.  "Tecolote" is  one of their most unusual departures, and still makes me laugh, while  enjoying its musicality and orignality.  "Didn't Even Know Her  Name" is a poignant lost love song; "Welcome to the Music"  is one of those opening songs bands sometimes did to orient their fans to  what to expect.  Even Larry Knechtel gets in on the vocals with the  intriguing "Picture in My Mind."  It's a great album---in fact,  there's not a bad "Bread" album out there!  Enjoy, and relive  those magical moments of the glorious seventies	pos

This is a great "linguisa"!  I usually buy mine from a store a few towns away because they have 'HOT' Chorizo Sausage but these have a really great flavor even though they are not 'hot'.

Perhaps Black and Decker got a lot of complaints about an earlier edition of this item-- but I should note first that the one I received today has nice, heavy metal clamps. ---  --- Haven't used it yet but I'm confident it will work well. I'm very impressed by the apparent high quality of construction and fit and finish, as well as design. ---  --- Frankly, I think it would be a good value at the $49.99 Amazon lists as the retail price-- but of course Amazon's price with free shipping is that much better	pos
Before purchasing this product I did the trial of Photoshop for 30 days and then the trial of this one.  Paint Shop Pro (PSP) won hands down!  While they both have similar features, the learning curve on Photoshop is ridiculous...PSP is so intuitive, you can figure out most of the features on your won, but the help feature is great...side by side help as you click through the menus and buttons.  I was impressed!  The red-eye fix is excellent and flexible, with ability to change to pet eye, different eye colors, WOW, there is just so much and all ready to use out of the box without any complicated aftermarket manuals needed.   I have restored some antique photos with very impressive results.  So far I have not had the instability issues that others cite, but my PC is heavy on the graphics capability and memory, perhaps that helps.	pos
Susanna Rowson's "Charlotte Temple" is not the first novel and certainly not the last to deal with the topic of the morally fallen woman. Poor, pitiful Charlotte finds herself in the midst of an immoral and unforgiving world where one transgression sends her on the road to permanent ruin.          Rowson encases her heroine Charlotte Temple within a world of virtue and vengeance. Charlotte has no possible means of escaping her inevitable fate because the author/narrator makes it clear from the onset that she has written this story as a lesson to young woman. She has no real interest in Charlotte as a dimensional character. Charlotte simply serves as a symbol of lost virtue and symbols do not have real emotions or feelings.           "Charlotte Temple" was written in 1794 and became one of the first best sellers of the newly formed America. A morally abhorrent woman who pays for her sins almost always guaranteed a best seller in the eighteenth century and now "Charlotte Temple" has been rediscovered and published in a Scholarly Press edition.          Was this reclamation of Charlotte really necessary? In the past twenty years, feminist scholars have rediscovered authors and texts that have gone out of print or been totally ignored by the literati. Authors such as Anne Plumptre, Frances Burney, Aphra Behn, Sarah Fielding and Charlotte Lennox have been dusted off and given new literary lives. Feminist scholar Cathy Davidson has taken Charlotte Temple in hand and aims to join Rowson to the above list of rediscoveries.          Unfortunately, Rowson does not warrant such treatment. Rowson has a flat, humorless approach to the fallen woman story. Unlike Burney's "Evelina" or "Camilla," Rowson does not imbue her narrative with needed levity.  Her pedantic iron-fisted preaching smothers the modern reader in a moral morass that confounds rather than illuminates.           In many of the fallen women stories, authors would use the genre as a subversive technique to criticize the patriarchal structures. Rowson does engage in such subversion within the novel. She seeks to preach to the young women who may fall victim to the unscrupulous man -- in England and America, it was not considered altogether lady-like to read a novel, so Rowson would be preaching to young women who had already transgressed.          Rowson does not criticize men within the novel. She does not censure Montraville for taking Charlotte as his mistress, impregnating her and abandoning her for a wealthier woman. When he believes that Charlotte has becomes his best friend's mistress, he does not believe that she would soil her reputation even though she has ruined her life by engaging in an illicit affair with him.          He aims to enact revenge upon the friend for acting "dishonorable" against her. Yet if he had not acted dishonorably towards her, she would not have been reduced to a penniless, pregnant ex-mistress scrounging the streets for food and shelter. He never takes responsibility for his role in Charlotte's downfall.  Rowson had the perfect opportunity for savage criticism of the patriarchy with Montraville but she fails to take it.           Instead, Rowson places the blame for Charlotte's ruin on the women within the novel. When Charlotte leaves the safe bosom of her morally upstanding family, she enters into the deviant world of the female who fail to protect her from licentious men.          Madame Du Pont errs in judgment by hiring the morally loose Miss La Rue. Madame Du Pont sets Charlotte's downfall in action. Rowson does not punish the ignorant Madame Du Pont by killing her, she ends up an hysterical mess after the Montraville/Charlotte "elopement."          Miss La Rue, the woman who pushes Charlotte into the arms of Montraville, must be punished for being a promiscuous woman. She ends up poor and begs for her last scrap of food. She ends up dying painfully as Rowson takes the opportunity to lecture her readers on the improper behavior of loose women.          Why would modern readers want to read this? I do not think any intelligent would reader would want to subject themselves to the depressing experience of reading this novel. At 125 pages, it seemed to progress at such an excruciating pace. No character has any shadings. There are no subplots to divert the attention from the static Charlotte. Rowson does nothing to keep our interest.          Unfortunately Rowson has become a heroine to feminist scholars for her feat as the first American woman to have a best-selling novel. That accomplishment is noteworthy as literary trivia, but it does not make for engaging reading	neg

I really wanted to like this game.. unfortunately for me, it blows. I'd trade it for a migraine if I could. The gameplay is pretty horrible, the sword scenes are reminiscent of PC adventure games circa 1992, where you press the "Attack" key and  swing your sword aimlessly at the bad-guy. The run & gun part of the game is nothing to write home about either. It feels like being teleported into the body of a cracked-out, 1 legged, drunken monkey.  ---  --- Also, I know the graphics aren't the Wii's strong-point, but that is no excuse to regress back to 8-bit. When you're trying to shoot someone across the room, it really sucks when you can't tell them  apart from a flower pot.....or is that a lawn chair? ---  --- The cut scene's were obviously supposed to look like Sin City. I stress the word SUPPOSED cause they were probably strung together by some poor intern after the development team went into hiding. They look like an amateur flash slide-show. Kinda like what your local mom & pop video editor would have put together if your little nephew had gotten his way and had a Sin City themed Bar Mitzvah. ---  --- This game is a joke. Anybody associated with it should be embarrassed.	neg
This case is made for an L6. The L2 uses the same case, so they both fit within this rubber case. However, the keys are laid out differently on the L6 - so this case has the grooves slightly off on the keys. I didn't give it a low rating, because it's well built and is actually a really great product - just wanted to give  other L2 owners a warning. It works well, but it's just a little funky on an L2, but totally usable. For the price, you just can't beat it - and it's a much better option than watching your phone pop into 2 or 3 pieces each time it falls out of your pocket	pos

I purchased the LJ3390 to replace an existing LJ3320.  The $350 rebate available until the end of Oct was the deciding factor as it made the unit a very reasonable purchase. ---  --- My main interest in the upgrade was to purchase a network connected printer.  Duplex print capability was the other factor that tipped the scale in favour of the LJ3390 over the LJ3052. ---  --- I now have 3 desktop and 2 laptop printers all printing successfully.  All run XP SP2 and are either connected via a wired or wireless network connection.  Software installation went flawlessly. ---  --- While I can't comment about HP versus other vendor software, I can say that the LJ3390 software is a major improvement over that of my LJ3320.  Scanning is faster by at least a factor of 2X, quite likely more like 3-4X.  Printing of complex pages is also much faster, exactly what I would expect from a newer generation print engine and an HP Laserjet printer. ---  --- All in all I am very pleased that I upgraded.  It has met all my upgrade goals.  Printing is faster, scanning is much faster.  The network connectivity ensures anyone can print without another machine being forced to be a print server and constantly left on.  I haven't played with the fax side yet, but am hoping this finally let's me retire my trusty standalone fax machine. --- 	pos
Where else can you get a magazine that talks about whatever it wants? From the perspectives of guys obsessed with computers, technology, and electronics, you get to find out news on just about anything remotely relating to these topics. Political, scientific, hollywood, businesses, technology, I love it. I get to read about topics that are covered in mainstream news sources, and on the next page, what's new with Japanese schoolgirls. I get such a kick out of it. ---  --- I also love the pseudo-geek talk that they caricature. It's kind of stupid that reviews are all "wired" or "tired" but in a funny stupid way.  ---  --- And buried in the enjoyable trash of this magazine are of course, all the many articles about new electronics that I love to keep up with.

The desktop charger comes with a second charging slot so you always have a spare battery ready for those last minute low battery alerts.  It saves time and one last thing to worry about.

It doesn't weakin as did my i1000 battery when charging started at mid range.  --- However, the first time you charge or recharge your Lithium battery is the most important charge of all.  You must let the initial or first chatge run out completey before begining to recharge the battery.  The "deader" the battery on it's first run the better the life of the battery and standby time for charges to come. --- Highly recommended	pos

If you crave a gay-themed film full of brooding obsession, gloomy (and very well done) night photography, the occasional graphic sex scene, and METAPHORS so obvious even a high school film class could catch them, then this just might be your cup of tea. Howewver, if you are looking for a film that sustains its running time and subject, then you are out of luck. ---  --- To be fair, Portugese director João Pedro Rodrigues has made some daring choices here. Dialogue is minimal--this might as well be a silent film with sound effects. He's working one of the great themes--the boundary between dream and reality and the dangers of ignoring that boundary. There is the further theme of sexual oppression triggering further oppressions. And yes, there is more than a little boundage mixed in. (This is no 50s MGM musical.) It looks good--night photography, lots of backlight and black surfaces, either dull or glittering. Sergio (played by Ricardo Meneses, a garbageman in Lisbon, drifts further and further into his obsession with a hunky young swimmer (and Sergio is pretty hunky himself). While not obsessing, he drifts from one random sexual encounter to another. Finally, he goes off the beam completely (I won't go into all the details in case you decide to see it). ---  --- The problem is the same that so many self-consciously arty films, from Greed to The Unbearable Lightness of Being, share--their metaphors are too obvious (here, among others, it's human and animal behavior--Sergio's best relationship is with his dog and he lapses into canine behavoir periodically) and they are just too long. O Fantasma would make a pretty good 40 minutes festival film--at 90 minutes, it just drags, particularly the ending with Sergio wandering interminably in a landfill in a rubber bondage suit. (Come to think of it, kind of --- an echo of the equally tedious final sequence of Greed.) I admit it--I really haven't the patience for films that scream out how ARTFUL they are and have little or nothing except style, attitude, and angst. Style and attitude--think Fred Astaire--can be a winning combination. Unfortunately, in spite of lashings of kink and plenty of existential hysteria, this is not a winning film.

Loving the look of the Rolex Daytona, I spotted this watch on Amazon and just had to have one (at the price). --- Arrived in a well padded display box, with all parts of the watch and strap covered in a protective plastic - so no scratches. --- Taking out a few links for that custom fit just took a couple of minutes. --- The watch looks great - better than the images on the Web - and it works as described. --- Other posters that have had issues should read the manual! It does all of the chrono functions, and has full adjustments for hand alignment etc. - Fantastic	pos
The very early years of optical character recognition (OCR) were quite the challenge.  Programs cost thousands of dollars, as did the scanners.  None of them worked very well.  It would take longer to "clean up" the document after scanning than it would for the secretary to have typed it in from scratch.  All of that has of course now changed, and Omnipage 15 Pro takes the art and craft to a new level. ---  --- I have been using the Omnipage product for the last seven years or so.  I use it my law office (along with a number of the other Scansoft, now Nuance, suite of products) on a daily basis, many times through out the day. We use it to chew up everything from court pleadings, to 100 page plus contracts, to real estate property descriptions, which must be accurate down to the comma and semicolon.  Our needs are fairly simple - get the text into the word processor so we can respond on behalf of our client as fast as possible.  ---  --- OP15Pro offers a significant performance increase over its predecessor version 14.  It is faster (very much faster) and more accurate.  Work flow is straight forward.  There is of course the ability to manually set or readjust recognition zones, recognize and format as spreadsheets.  This new version easily handles text in relation to graphic elements and does a good job of keeping them all together in their right places.  Like most everything else, and especially with computers and software, nothing is perfect and there are times that OP15 misses a mark.  It is however, for the most part, very accurate and efficient, but remember, the old rule of "garbage in equals garbage out" still applies.  We have recently started taking pen scanner images of documents in the books at the local registries of deeds.  These are 200 dpi scans of documents that themselves are old photocopies of text placed on paper with IBM Selectrics or worse.  In other words, stuff from the dark ages of the 1970's and before.  We were pleasantly surprised at how well OP15Pro performed. With these very old images there is a need to clean them up, but nowhere near what it used to be. ---  --- I will comment only briefly about the company's tech support.  There has always been enough information provided to get the software up and running. The key, of course, is to read and follow the directions.  A task that is sometimes difficult in this "I want it now world."  ---  --- The one "free call" is not just for installation problems, but can come months or even years after the product is purchased.  I have also found on occasion that tech support will often answer the simple and obvious questions without first asking for the credit card.  Solving technical problems can be frustrating and time consuming.  Considering what the software is attempting to do, there fact that it accomplishes it at all seems at times to be just short of a miracle. Lastly, the company's knowledge base is filled problem solving information.  There is also a tremendously large user base that supports the product through Usenet and other forums. ---  --- Norm Michaels, Esq	pos
After using my iM716s for about 4 months now I have a few things to say about them. ---  --- 1) Price: Lists for $199 on Altec's site.  $70 is a steal. --- 2) Quality: Top notch in the earphones, the clip on the volume module is weak. --- 3) Performance: Bar none best I've had.  These things outperform the huge Logitech ear muff set I use mainly to mow in.  These things allow me to mow the lawn without having to jack up the volume to drown out the mower. --- 4) Conclusion: The only thing that stops me from saying these are perfect is the volume module can be a pain and get in the way.  When moving around, you NEED to have it clipped to something, otherwise it can create inner ear noise.  This can get quite annoying.  I've also caught the cord on things, causing the clip to bend away from the module.  It is removeable and I was able to bend it back.  If there were a pair of equal quality w/o the module, even for the same price, I'd go that route.  With that said, I am in no way regretting my purchase and will recommend these to anyone asking me about them or my 60GB video ipod	pos

I bought this a few months ago, and after about three or four shaves it stopped working properly. It yanks on the hairs instead of cutting them, which is very painful! It doesn't pull them all the way out, which is even worse because it means you have to go over and over the same spots if your desperate enough to continue.  Sometimes it works okay, but what good is a razor that only works half the time? Others here have noted the short battery life and change in sound when it's losing power. Mine does sound "slower" when it's yanking the hair, but that doesn't seem to be related to battery charge (e.g. it can start the shave in evil hair-pulling mode, and then straighten up and shave right five minutes in!) Even when not pulling hair, the shave is not close. Definitely find a different razor	neg
NYRB features long, in-depth articles about recent books and events.  The "reviews" frequently take the book under discussion as a starting point for a wide-ranging essay which then becomes a work in its own right.  Indeed, I've seen articles in NYRB referred to in academic papers.  Don't fear that NYRB will bore you, however.  I've often found a NYRB article to be a great introduction to an area of thought or literature previously unknown to me. ---  --- The only negative is a rather tedious Michael-Mooreish political stance.  I have no objection to seeing Bush bashed, but wish that NYRB could do so in a more creative and less repetitive manner. Maybe once in a while we could hear from someone who actually likes the man? ---  --- Nevertheless I find NYRB an indispensable periodical.  I find it a great complement to The Economist, which features a more pro-business and pro-free trade economic stance and wider, but less deep, coverage of the world	pos
I understand that software companies strive to give new versions of their products "new" or "better" appearances but in my opinion toos and defaults should be recognizable from version to version as much as possible.  I have used versions of Corel since CorelDraw!3 I just moved to X3 from 10 and find that the trace tool works better but the mechanism is somewhat cryptic.  I would have great sympathy for a buyer that is using it for the first time if they had never used an older version simply because I could only figure it out through past knowledge and trial and error.  The results were great but the methodology lacks some of the intuitiveness of the past versions.  The pallettes are far less comprehensive thn version 10's pallettes.  I truly wish I had version 8's pantone pallette back even though it is incomplete it was so much better layed out.  i will never understand why black has to be at one end of the pallette and white at the other, waste of time...   The tools are all there but they appear different.  I went to work in X3 fright away and found I could work effectively on day one but I did resort to version 10 (which I have kept on my system) a few times in the first week to perform operations that I coupdn't figure out in X3 which were simple in 10.  The Help files are circuitous, apparently never actually getting to the point.  The on line tutorials are great for the absolute novice but useless to anyone who actually has worked with vector art before.  The Export to AI is still a little inaccurate even after all these years.  (You cannot select a line terminus and expect it to be there in AI) The EPS export filter doesn't always want to be readable in Adobe either.  The price is excellent, the product spectacular in its own right and I am happy with my purchase. I expected a little more in this version than I got but no less than I had with additional compatibility.  I still need to have a copy of Illustrator on my machine to deal with people who have only that program	pos

I brought this after having played Caesar3 and loved it but wanted something with a bit more scope for controlling dynamics of a city - and I thought being a civcity game this would offer me the extension - WRONG - this is a bad rip off of Caesar3, sure, graphics are more advanced with the zoom in view but other than that I was playing the same game but with less involvement or control. This is a sit back and let it happen to you game - keep the people happy and build everything and they'll stay. Caesar IV - that's what you're wanting, it looks like everything this sets itself up to be that it isn't. Feel like I've wasted my money	neg
I bought this Speedo because I like its new strechy fabric and the handsome design. The biggest problem is that the 1-inch wide elastic band can not stay flat on my waist after a few uses.

I bought this for my 4 year old grandson for Christmas.  We opened it up and sat on the floor and began putting it together.  He was excited because he is a Lighting McQueen fan.  He got about four pieces of it together and got very frustrated.  It would not stay together.  THE PUZZLE IS JUNK!!!!!!!!  The pieces are not flat and do not interlock so that they stay together.  He lost interest and left.  I finished it enough so that they were laying together to see the picture - which is very cute.  But, no way would they ever all fit together.  Do not waste your money on this.  I also had to retape the corners of the box, as they were all coming apart too.  Yea for cheap imports.  The USA is so much better off for them???????	neg
The program is great.  Sometimes the GPS is slightly off though.  I'll be travelling on a major highway and all of the sudden it will tell me that I'm off route for no reason.

One of the main reasons that I decided to become a GameCube owner was due to its ability to play GBA, GBC, and GB games on an external source, a television, a projector, a 5" universal screen, etc. I could care less about its inability to play DVDs because I had already owned a PlayStation 2 for that. Then afterwards, I started using less for Game Boy titles and more for a game called Super Smash Bros Melee, which most of my former floormates used to play almost all of the time and I would just stand there and watch. ---  --- The system itself is cube-shaped, hence the name GameCube. Like the original Xbox, it comes with four controller sockets and the controller is similar in appearance, but smaller (and no, it is not better than the PS2 controller). Like the PlayStation 2, it uses memory cards to store data. Unique to the GameCube is a handle on the back of the unit, making it easier to carry. Furthermore, it can be purchased in a variety of colors: platinum, black, and purple. Other colors can be imported, though I would recommend finding a store that does paint jobs.  ---  --- I'm giving this an 8.3/10, but that's only because as a North American, I can't help but feel somewhat cheated. For whatever reason, when it comes to video games and their machines, the US dwellers are always deprived of really neat things, like Panasonic Qs (GameCubes with built-in DVD players), GameCube/Game Boy player bundle deals, PlayStation Xs, NES Axe Colors, Tri-star adapters, Game Boy hunters, the availability of systems in multiple colors, etc. Interestingly enough, I've found this problem to be prevalent with mostly the Nintendo and Sony systems. (Whoever said life isn't fair sure wasn't joking.) If the Panasonic Q had ever been released in the US and if this system had at lest been available in more colors here (without having to import - an unnecessarily tedious, complicated and excessively costly procedure, by the way), then this probably could have gotten something closer to the 5-star range, but with all due respect, one would think that Nintendo would start showing a little more consideration and respect for us Americans than that. ---  --- The KAB score: 8.3 super.	pos

even if you are not, buy this watch.  I am a nurse, much like many of the other reviewers.  In fact, I bought it due to their reviews.  It is a fantastic watch.  Easy to read, has an illumination option and a handy date feature.  The only trouble I have is the size of the band (too long).  I will take it to a jeweler to take a few links out, however, the directions for doing this yourself make it looks easy (it's not).  Don't even bother looking for another watch, this one is a steal	pos
They run MUCH smaller than Birkenstocks. I sent the size 44 back (which is comfy in the comparable model in Birkenstocks; is it the Boston?) and got the 45 and it STILL feels small. The upper is ok, the shoe isn't the best made thing but is adequate; it's just the size thing that bothered me	neg

Be forewarned those who may be driving in the desert at night on some dark, deserted piece of highway. Stop for hitchhikers at your own risk. Also avoid the urge of trying to be too helpful to fellow motorist stranded along the way. Remember things are not always what they appear to be. ---   --- This was quite a well-constructed, coherent storyline from beginning to end. You are never left in the dark with this plot. Everything is explained at the appropriate time, the history of this particular vampire sect, how they happened to show up in Midwest America, how the vampire virius works in the body, its telepathic properties and what must be done to cure yourself from the curse of "The Forsaken." All this infomation was nicely worked into the script in such a way as not to bog down the viewer with too much substance, hence detracting from what the average movie fan is looking for, gore and violence. ---  --- A brief comment for any young girls who may get struck watching this with a boyfriend. While you may not enjoy the horror elements in the movie you might enjoy the male members of the cast which includes; Brendan Fehr (Roswell), Kerr Smith (Dawson's Creek, Final Destination) and Johnathon Schaech (That Thing You Do) as the head vampire. ---  --- Brendan Fehr was terrific as the young, wise beyond his years vampire hunter roaming the highways and byways in search of the vampire that infected him with the virius. My favorite scene in the movie is when Nick (Brendan Fehr) and Sean (Kerr Smith) stop at a roadside diner for a bite to eat. A two-way conversation quickly turns into a monologue when Nick begins to compare the aspirations and hopes of his generation with those of the last. It's not only hilarious, but absolutely true. Without giving away too much of the ending, I'll just say a perfect opening was provided for a sequel. While I'm not generally a fan of sequels, I would've liked to see Brendan Fehr reprise his role of vampire hunter at least one more time. ---  --- Simply the most enjoyable vampire film since "The Lost Boys."	pos
We've only used the mic (and another that is identical) about 10 times now, but no complaints so far.  My experience with Logitech products has been good in the past and I expect no different this time.  We use it for the Karaoke Revolution games for the PS2. ---  --- It would be nice if there was a gain adjustment right on the mic, but that may be a limitation of the PS2 or the game, so I can't hold that against the mic without knowing more. ---  --- The cord is pretty long, I'd say 12' or so.  Whether or not it works on a PC or if a PC-USB mic works on a PS2, I don't know.   --- Since I don't have any complaints, you might wonder why I gave it 4 stars and not 5.  To me, 4 stars means "It does the job and has no major flaws".  5 stars means "This thing is awesome!	pos

I had to return this phone twice to Motorola for keys that weren't working.  It was too frustrating. ---  --- Can't use the phone in my house or at work although my prior Nokia worked well.  ---  --- There are some nice things -- but these are externals and certainly not explained in the user manual. --- --customisation of the front screen is do-able. --- --there's a composer in the phone to compose your own ringtone.  No mention in the user manual.  Stumbled across it. --- --Ringtones are expensive to buy from Cingular.  First you pay for the ringtone and then you pay for the access to the internet to download it.  A double payment.  The saving grace was the ability to send the ringtones to myself by searching for methods on the internet.   --- --The volume was always frustrating.  I was unable to find a ringtone loud enough so that i could hear the phone when it's in my purse.  Volume controls are easy.  However putting the phone on vibrate was buried in the menus and not in the user manual.  Counterbalanced by the ability to put an icon on the front screen so i could easily change it to vibrate.   --- -- I especially hate how loud the phone is when you go to turn it off in a theater.  You're being responsible and the phone does that annoying Moto noise.  It's only silent when you shut it down from silent ringing.  Yet to set it on silent ringing using the side buttons, you get noisy tones as you lower the volume	neg

I discovered Seal the same way that most people did: through his utterly beautiful song "Kiss From A Rose".  I heard it on the radio one day, and played it constantly for months after that until I finally decided to purchase the album the song was from.  As it happens, the song is from Seal's most revered album, his multi-platinum 1994 self-titled album.  (This is not to be confused with his other self-titled album, his debut, released in 1991.)  I didn't know what to expect when I bought the album, having heard only one song from it, but months after purchasing it I'm glad I made the gamble. ---  --- I think that the sub-genre which best classifies SEAL is urban.  Urban music, according to All Music Guide, is smooth and polished, often romantic, sometimes uptempo and funky, and features soulful vocals.  SEAL has all of this and more.  It has techno beats, but they're not as overwhelming as one might expect.  They blend together with peaceful, occasionally ethereal guitars and Seal's incredibly soothing singing.  This is, no doubt, stylish music, but first and foremost it's a collection of warm, encouraging songs penned by a very talented musician.  There's nothing that comes close to being a bad song here; there's not even a slightly weak composition.  Thus it's a little harder to pick highlights than usual.  Some highlights include the strong opening track, "Bring It On"; the emotional hit "Prayer For The Dying"; the shimmering "Dreaming In Metaphors"; the upbeat "Newborn Friend"; and, needless to say, the absolutely wonderful "Kiss From A Rose".  The closing track, "Bring It On (Reprise)" is another beautiful song, but "Kiss From A Rose" is possibly the most lovely song I've ever heard.  Listening to it in the warmth of one's home during a snowy December afternoon is an incredibly powerful experience. ---  --- The message of the album, if there is one, is "Keep on going - life is beautiful!"  It could fail under any other popular artist, but Seal succeeds marvelously.  This is some of the most heartfelt, inspirational singing I've ever heard.  There's a delightful optimism in Seal's singing that sounds strong rather than naiive.  It's hard to feel down after listening to such an uplifting album as this.  Seal is certainly one of the most talented musicians of R&B (or rock - you decide).  These songs have clear, strong messages, warm, inspirational lyrics, heartfelt, soothing singing, danceable beats, and a whole lot of emotion. ---  --- Once you've heard "Kiss From A Rose", I guarantee you'll want to pick up the album.  If you're already thinking of doing so, then I encourage you to go forward and buy it; you won't regret it.  It's become one of my favorite albums.  When you're feeling disillusioned or depressed with the state of your life or just life in general, look no further than SEAL to make you cherish it once again.	pos

I have been struggling with dry skin and mild acne for years. Recently, I revamped my cleansing routine and my makeup. I bought the Philosphy Purity cleanser and Hope in a Jar. It has made an unbelievable difference in my skin! My skin is smooth, not a dry flake anywhere. It is as soft as a baby's butt. ---  --- It is worth noting that a little goes a LONG way. You only need a very small amount (about the size of a dime or less) for your whole face. It is a very light texture, almost like a mousse, and glides over your skin and absorbs quickly. If you use too much (I did the first few times)then your face could look greasy. If you remember that less is more, then you will get a perfectly moisturized, yet matte, complexion. ---  --- After using the Philosophy cleanser and Hope in a Jar, I use the Bare Escentuals mineral makeup (bought the Light/Fairly Light starter kit). My skin, for the first time ever, is flawless. No acne. No dry skin. No reddish areas. Just a perfectly smooth complexion. I keep looking in the mirror, thinking "Is this my skin? Really?" I cannot believe what a difference this product (and the mineral makeup) has made.  ---  --- I have heard of others being allergic to some ingredients in the Hope in a Jar, so it is not for everyone. I suggest getting a sample size to make sure you won't have a reaction	pos
I got this shirt when it was on sale for $10 so I snatched it up quickly. I like the shirt a lot. It is very pretty on. Order the size that you normally wear.

I can't believe that with technology as advanced as it is, Samsung could produce this giant POS. It's flashy, yes. But does it deliver??

But the phone is only good IF YOU CAN USE IT!!! It's been years since I've had such lousy reception from a phone.

Mr. Hayek apparently despises free thought.  Furthermore, his ignorance of libertarian philosophy is clear; discounting his opinion is appropriate.  I'm guessing he is a Republicrat and finds the socialist ideas found in the corrupt two party system satisfying.  Funny considering his namesake, Frederich Hayek, is one of the greatest libertarian thinkers of all time and one of my personal heros.   ---  --- But, I digress:  Reason magazine has been in my mailbox every month for well over 20 years and I would buy a lifetime subscription if I could.  Not every issue is a five star issue, but on the whole Reason is the most interesting periodical on the market.  That said, Reason has dropped a notch in quality ever since the brilliant Virginia Postrel left the editor's post several years ago.  She is a true intellectual and kept Reason at a consistently high level.  I still love to read my issue every month and while I don't always agree with the positions I am always stimulated	pos
Granted, I saw this movie at about three in the morning at a party, but I think I had enough sense in me to realize how truly horrible it was. It's so... bad. It has some seriously subpar performances from pretty much all involved, and the script was just awful. Gosh, it's hard to believe I actually sat through it. It was just so... exactly what it was, I guess. A stupid sex comedy that's absolutely terrified to be anything else. The thing that really pushed this above the radar for me to blip at was the truly offensive tone of some of the material. I think my real downfall here was the fact that I'm a gay guy whose friends are mostly straight guys. The scenes regarding a certain character and his chance encounter with homosexuality are so repugnant it's almost ridiculous. Now, I'm not one to get offended easily, but this just took it a bit too far. Just the attitudes and behaviors expressed by most of the characters just made me depressed, which isn't really something I look for in a movie. It just seems to me that if 'gay' had been replaced with 'black', this would have been deemed racist and probably wouldn't ever have been released. Not that I'm condoning censorship, but when your tone becomes so... mocking, I guess. Oh well, I guess all I'm trying to say is I will definitely not be repeat viewing this film, and I don't recommend you view it at all if you're a woman, or gay, or you care about others	neg
I love it; I am a 55-year old woman in pretty good shape and I was able to get it out of the box and assembled completely by myself. It arrived very very quickly.

I bought this game on the fly cause the cover illustration looked so interesting that I couldn't resist. The instructions were a little confusing to understand at first, but once gameplay started it was picked up pretty easy and much fun was enjoyed by everyone. The game is geared for those ages 10 and up, but it was so easy to understand and so much fun, that my 8 year old neice was able to play without teaming up with an adult. The game promotes math skills which is a HUGE plus since many games today are only about fun. This game has it all, fun, education and the artwork on the cards is fantastic. When we played, we threw in chocolate gold pieces so we'd have real pirate plunder and everyone had to speak like a pirate. It's a really great way to spend quality time with your family and it's fun for all ages	neg
When I read Alpha Male Syndrome, I saw myself and the many "Alphas" I've worked with in high-tech corporate America.  In some instances I could call out the names of those I'd either worked with or had family relationships or friendships with - based on the Alpha types, strengths and risk behaviors so well defined in this book.   I found the practical tips - encouraging specific change, in those who don't seem open to changing - to be useful, hopeful, encouraging and sometimes even funny.  I may go broke sending Alpha Male Syndrome to my too-many Alpha friends and more importantly to those who work or live with them! ---  --- From soup to nuts I enjoyed recognizing and knowing myself better through the book and from taking the author's online Alpha Assessment - then following the Action Steps in the book, and updated online Alpha Tips.  I can see how and why Ms. Ludeman and Dr. Erlandson's approach to executive coaching is effective.  	pos
I purchased this kit, primarily for the extra battery, which retails for about what I paid for this item.  Having the backup battery is great, but I was pleasantly suprised by the soft case.  It protects my DSC-P200, without being bulky or heavy.  With the camera being so small, it was hard to find good protection without spending quite a bit of money.  The case for the memory sticks is nice as well.  It is easy to lose a stick if it's just floating around and the case keeps them securely.  All in all, this is an excellent value	pos
As other reviewers have stated, Ludlum passed away at the time of the publication of this novel. Unfortunately, we may never know what other voice has been mingled with Ludlum's to complete this tale. Honestly speaking, I believe this to be the case because the story is actually better than I have come to expect from Ludlum. No disrespect intended, but I feel this work is actually above his standard. ---  --- There is certainly a few moments of unbelievable plotting and characterization, but who cares when the ride is such a rip. At first you think you're reading a typical espionage thriller and eventually come to realize it's more than that, much more. For New World Order conspiracy fans you're in for a treat. Ludlum et al's take on an old plot is so fresh and intrigueing you are left speechless. I'll just say this, if you have ever wondered if the Nazi's survived WWII you will REALLY wonder after reading The Sigma Protocol. God help us if there's any truth to this plot	pos
I agree with the reviewer who likened it to actual lemon juice.  It is very strong, and I realized after spraying it twice it only needed once... most likely because it is an eau de parfum and not eau de toilette.  Very much worth the money.  I was complimented on it the entire day. It does not resemble lemon Pledge to me at all	pos
This pedometer is so much cheaper (~$7) than the typical decent ones (that go for about $18 - $20).. now I know it is for a reason.. the buttons are flimsy, the package looks very cheap, the one I bought and presented to a senior citizen - did not work, also found that the Sr Citizen found it very hard to use the buttons on this little device.. terrible ergonomics/form factor. ---  --- Would recommend spending a bit more and getting the Omron/Oregon Sc  $18 pedometers - much better form factor, high reliability and quality	neg
This was the first Disney movie I watched as a child. ---  --- I would still watch it today.  Disney successfully humanizes the movie to children by using "friendly" animals, while still keeping the main storylines intact. ---  --- Thumbs up to the music; "Love Goes On and On" is a moving piece, and even hits my hard heart.   ---  --- Parents with younger children be warned: Some scenes may frighten them. --- 	pos

I became a Robson Green fan when I saw the first season of Wire in the Blood.  Since then, I have read the books, and watched Green in his other crime series, Touching Evil.  If you like to watch films about police solving serial killer crimes, you will enjoy this.  The crimes are shocking, the denouement is interesting, and at the heart of the story is the developing relationship between Dr. Tony Hill (Green) and the police woman with whom he works these crimes	pos

My naturally curly hair is thinning and I thought this conditioner would be helpful. The conditioner did not handle the tangles in my hair nor did it make it feel conditioned.

This is not a good Tornado disaster movie by any stretch of the imagination. The worse thing about the film is the horrible, unconvincing special-effects! The scene where the family in the car trying to outrun the tornado in the town and the mom shrieking "It's coming closer!" is badly done and also Dan starting to fly out the window and his dad attaining super-human strength pulling him back into the vehicle is incredibly stupid and not dramatic in the slightest. I know, however, a guy named Mike and 2 robots who would probably have to endure this terrible B-grade movie (Actually F-grade) If you want a good, entertaining tornado movie that doesn't include bad acting, bad "Special" FX, bad script and dumb actors check out "Twister&quot	neg

All the positive comments you read here about this film are true.  ---  --- This classic western stars John Wayne, Pedro Armendariz and Harry Carey Jr, along with a great supporting cast lead by Ward Bond -- the usual John Ford suspects. Ford strikes a balance between action and sentimentality, directing this simple story in a straightforward fashion with a great sense of style. This is Ford's first color film and cinematography by Winton C. Hoch looks really, really rich and with enough sand to make you wish you had some lemonade.  ---  --- Duke really shines in this film -- just watch those expressions. ---  --- Restored to its original pristine 1948 35mm real Technicolor glory, "3 Godfathers" is a natural for the Christmas season. This heartwarming drama is a gritty, tender, timeless classic. A film the whole family can watch. ---  --- This sleeper film in the WB/MGM catalog was way, W A Y overdue on DVD in the US. But here it is, most welcomed and highly recommended! ---  --- (I've revised my original 2003 review to reflect this title's availability on DVD. Released with zero fanfare, I was first aware of its release when I saw a newspaper ad for it one week before Christmas 2005.	pos
GD USA is a monthly magazine targeted at, and available free to, professionals within the graphic design community.

Big disappointment. Cheaply made. T-rex model does not snap together, can not even fit together as parts are improperly molded.  Microscope less functional than a magnifying lens.  Volcano is ok, the plaster does work, but you must provide ingredients for the eruption.  Weather center very very flimsy and breaks.  I was quite surprised a name like Smithsonian would be associated with this low of quality in a product.  Supplies for crystals subpar for what is required.  Was an enormous disapointment after the holidays for my sons. 	neg

I wanted to use this product to tape sporting events, as part of a promotions unit I belong to. I had used Videowave 7 which was OK and produced a more than adequate product, but would on occassion crash to the extent I would have to reload the software. I thought I would give PE 3.0 ago, since Adobe products generally have a good reputation.  ---  --- Well, it goes to show that you can't just rely on reputation. The program lets me down horribly when capturing the video from the camera. THe camera records DVD video (VOB files) straight to DVD. When I capture these files into the PE program, all moving images within the video become pixelated with lost resolution to the point of being useless. I have tried various other ways of capturing but always the same result. There is nothing to be done from that point...for me this program falls on the first hurdle!! It is unbelievable to me that a professionally released image processing algorithm could corrupt video so badly, and frustrating that I actually paid money for it...a first year undergraduate could have provided a better effort.  ---  --- I have subsequently gone through the motions to produce a video, and to be honest he layout of the settings, ease of applicaiton of various functions is quite good and better than Videowave 7 IMHO. I was able to produce quite nice edited products with intro, text and audio overlays very quickly. Still this isn't much use when the video itself had already been digitally butchered. ---  --- If you are videoing things that don't move you may well like this product. If you are videoing dynamic scenes, give it a miss. Big disappointment	neg
I agree with the other reviewer that this is more like a shape sorter than a kitchen. My daughter loved it when she was 1. Now she's turned 2 and she's lost interest in it, like many other "baby toys". I had to get her a larger and more realistic toy kitchen so she can "cook" with it	pos

I just got this myself and it works like a charm.  Installation took atbout 1/2 hour and it works just like it advertises. ---  --- I couple of things.  I agree with the need to place the solar cell within a couple of inches of the garage door light.  I have a sears craftsman with a flourescent bulb which is enough with the solar cell right above the light.  There is a pressure stick pad that holds the solar cell onto the garage door opener.  There is a black 3-4 foot wire (looks like an RCA audio wire and plug) that connects the solar cell to the laser beam generator which is maybe about 3/4" long and about 3/8s of the inch wide.  It too has a stick adhesive to be glued onto your garage ceiling.  The laser pivots easily so it can be aimed. ---  --- The actual beam emits a pulsing red dot not bigger than 1/8" wide onto your dashboard when you drive under it.  It takes a little getting used to a first to know what to look for when you're parking.  My garage ceiling is about 2 feet above the roof of the car so it's pretty close to the laser generator.  If you have a higher ceiling, the mounting is probably harder but the dot is maybe slightly bigger.  The one thing that I have to adjust is that my wife is shorter than me so she sees the beam alittle later than I do and has to sit up a bit in the seat to see it on the dashboard of our Toyota Sienna which is a little flat.  I need to re-aim the laser to an easier to spot point for her since this is her parking slot.   ---  --- Works like a charm - just wish the dot was little bigger to make it easier to spot when you pull in.  Great feature not to have any batteries or plug ins required	pos
This item was easy to find, purchase and use. Saved us several dollars as well. A true win-win. Thanks	pos
I'm a huge fan of the Pria line, but these are not like the others - they are heavier and a little grainy.  I don't hate them, but will not buy them again.  The flavor is pretty good though, just not what I was expecting.  I highly recommend the Pria 110 calorie line - the vanilla is my favorite but the peanut butter and others are close behind. --- Thank	neg

This seems like a really sturdy, lightweight stroller. I just wanted something simple and strong that can get us out of the house quickly--we live in a very hilly, sort of rustic area, so I needed something I could take my son to the park in without hauling out the big buggy. This is really light, and it folds and has a carrying strap in case the boy wants to walk a bit. (There is also a storage bag for travel.) ---   --- The tires have treads on them, so they can handle steep terrain, and they give a pretty smooth ride over bumps. The fabric is sort of a thick canvas-sy polyester--not removable, but it seems like it could easily be scrubbed/hosed clean if necessary. The seat also has some padding and back support (although, on the con side, it's probably not the coolest compared to mesh). The weight limit is given as 37 lbs, so my 19-month old still has plenty of room to grow--his shoulders are comfortable and his feet don't reach the footrest yet (he is 27 pounds and about 33 inches tall). On the plus side, it seems bigger than the Wrangler All-Weather umbrella stroller, plus it reclines a bit (you unzip/unbutton the sides to allow the fabric to unfold), unlike the Volo.  ---  --- The square canopy is maybe not the greatest (it only covers the face, and could actually sit a little higher I think)--but as for everyone complaining that it falls off, I have found that when you flip the canopy to the back, if you then detach the back flap from the seat, you can  attach the side flaps to that velcro on the back to keep it from sliding off.  ---  --- Some people have also mentioned kicking the wheels, but I'm 5'6" and haven't had any problems--I think it's a matter of not standing right on top of the thing since it's an umbrella stroller and doesn't have a superwide wheelbase.  ---  --- I would give it 4.5 stars I think, but am giving 5 because of the great price! I'm pretty happy with this--and my son is constantly trying to climb in, so he must like it too... I figure that with the money we saved, we can buy a nice Kettrike or some other form of transportation the boy can grow into.	pos

Don't be fooled by the similar-sounding, inarticulate reviews--this product is not what you think it is. It contains neither motor nor electrical stimulation. The "energy fields" described have nothing to do with actual energy/electricity--they might as well use the word "aura" for all of the logical sense it makes.  ---  --- In the words of a company representative: ---  --- The Tingler is not battery operated there is no button. That would be our Sqwiggler which has 2 AA batteries located in the handle.  You're welcome to return the Tingler for a Sqwiggler.  The Sqwiggler is $29.95 Please call 800-978-8765 and we can get your credit card information and charge the amount difference of $9.95 plus $8.45 for the shipping fees.  ---  --- Make your own judgement, but don't expect to be as wowed or thrilled as the company claims you'll be	neg

We received one of these with our new Skeeter Beater. --- I didn't know why there were no gnats, or mosquitos, buzzing around my head, and in my face, as there always are... yet,  no bugs were in the tray of this large Skeeter machine. I thought that it was repelling, instead of killing the gnats and mosquitos.   --- Well, after a couple of days, my husband remembered that we received this little gizmo, and he had forgotten that he turned it on and left it running in the screen house. --- This little thing was apparantly repelling the bugs away from the large skeeter unit!  It was sitting approximately 15' away. --- Those gnats flying in your face and eyes, constantly, can drive you mad, and they were there all day, every day...what a nightmare!  Now, even in the evening, no mosquitos!  What the heck is in this thing?  It works without dangerous chemicals???? --- This is absolutely the best repeller I have ever used, and I have tried them all.  We live in a large wooded area, surrounded by ponds, lakes, and swamps.  We are amazed at this item, and will be buying more.  Psyche!!!  NO BUGS!!! 	pos

Within two hours of recieving my complaint the seller refunded my money, without requriing that I ship the product back.  For that I am thankful and appreciative, and can recommend the seller. I have no idea what was up with the product. ---  --- As I noted earlier, I just recieved this product and it has the overwhelming smell of petroleum, literally like the smell that comes from an oil truck delivering fuel oil to your home.  I bought this for a child and would never dream of giving it to them.  I am contacting the seller to request a refund.  If I succeed I will note that in the review and increase the star rating	neg
The gripmaster has helped me strengthen my left fingers which is so important in the use of my reins when riding.

So I ordered two more! --- 	pos
First of all, this is NOT the worst movie ever made, nor even the worst movie ever made that was given a budget and some name stars. The worst movie ever made was "Autumn in New York", but that is a different review.  ---  --- No, this not a great movie, but it is very interesting. And for once, thank God, it doesn't end with everything tied up in a pretty Hollywood bow where everthing works out for everyone. It has a gritty sort of realism that transcends the walk through performances of the stars of the movie. And the scenery works well for the overall feel of the movie, bleak. ---  --- More interestingly for me and others of my generation who grew up with the brat pack, this marked the end of these actors forays into trying to do the teenager thing. For Molly Ringwald, she didn't do anything of note again until "The Stand" six years later, and for Andrew McCarthy, well it could be argued that he still hasn't starred in anything of note again (although he probably made some money from "Weekend at Bernies" I & II). ---  --- Anyway, probably better to rent than buy, I am only buying it to complete my 80's collection.  ---  --- 	neg
This is a highly entertaining film with an incredibly minimalist screenplay that succeeds beyond all expectations. This film's strengths are its characters and the actors that portray them. Sean Connery plays Captain Marko Ramius with great bravado and charisma relying greatly on his mesmerizing screen presence to maneuver the entire direction of this film. Tim Curry is amusing as the dutiful Dr. Petrov in a role well suited for him. The rest of the cast balances out the histrionics of Sean Connery and Tim Curry with realistic and convincing performances to bring authenticity and realism to the drama of this film. Alec Baldwin as Jack Ryan, James Earl Jones as Admiral James Greer, Sam Neill as Captain Vasily Borodin, Scott Glenn as Commander Bart Mancuso, Richard Jordan as Dr. Jeffrey Pelt and an impressive Peter Firth as Political Officer Ivan Putin bring a needed sense of pragmatism to their collective roles to bolster the dramatics and emotion of the story. This was probably one of Alec Baldwin's best performances and he truly conducts himself in the manner that the character of Jack Ryan should have been portrayed. Baldwin perfectly conveyed the analytical mind that the character of Jack Ryan embodied. Sam Neill is also brilliant as the dedicated officer who also possesses a very human side that perhaps puts him in conflict with carrying out his duties to the full extent of his country's political dictates and ambitions. Sam Neill has a wonderful role in this regard and he plays it flawlessly. I liked Scott Glenn's character immensely as the US Commander who truly has to rely on his instincts and his logical interpretation of facts and events to face what is put before him. The list of performances goes on but the point is that portrayal of these characters and how they think and conduct themselves is at the heart of this film. Their efforts make this film a great political, action-adventure and emotional drama. 	pos

I can't believe how well made this set is. I have been looking for good quality kitchen toys for my daughter for Christmas. I wanted something sturdy and not plastic. I just received my order today and these items are great! My son opened the box and tested them for his little sister and he can't wait to play with them with her.  --- I ordered this set and the baking set and both are made out of solid wood and are extremely durable. I am very impressed and wish amazon carried the matching coffee pot and blender! ---  --- I also had a problem with the velcro on the butter.  It was an easy fix with some super glue.  I think the heat during the shipping made the velcro come off	pos
I have been an extremely devoted SMB fan since the very first time I laid eyes on it. I own ALL of them, and so when I stood in line all night Saturday (and through Sunday morning, 8am), I made sure to grab myself a copy of SMB: Banana Blitz for my brand new Wii. I bought an entire set of controllers, anticipating the mini-game fun with all my friends. (We're huge SMB fans, all of us. It always makes an appearance at our parties.) ---  --- But now I'm really angry. They completely gutted our favorite mini-game(s), hitting Monkey Target worst of all. I can honestly say I don't care that there are 50 freakin mini-games, because now Monkey Target is completely worthless. Instead of the amazingly subtle game play with bonus items, increasingly difficult levels, magnets, velcro, double bonuses, wind speed and direction, and the all-import ramp run-off you have... a cannon, one level, no wind or wind direction, no bonuses, and no special items. ---  --- Who cares if I can SORT of pilot a submarine on a single level? Monkey squash -- no joy there. A lot of the controls for the mini-games are terrible. And so on, so forth. The new mini games suck almost unilaterally, but gosh darn, there are 50 of them! But volume does not make up for lack of quality. ---  --- I love traditional SMB levels and the ones on SMB: Banana Blitz are nice. The graphics are beautiful and fun. But the best part of the game for me and my friends, is now gone and dead. None of the reviews I'd read mentioned the fact that this favorite of most SMB players was killed like this, and if they had, I certainly wouldn't have wasted my $50 plus tax. ---  --- If Sega people are reading this: BRING BACK MONKEY TARGET. That's what people play at parties when they're slightly drunk and sick of listening to Super Smash Brothers, and way too awake to enjoy Mario Party	neg

This is a great controller.Especially after all the complaints microsoft had got about its original controller being too bulky(Personally speaking I never really had problems with even that).But since I got Xbox Controller S, I havent touched the big one.This controller gives a better grip,buttons are softer and their positioning is better(the overall feel is quite good).I played rallisport challenge with this controller and beat the whole game. Even in a game like rallisport where precision is required in accelaration and braking to successsfully  master the tracks,I did it without any problems using this controller.Also the vibration feel is very good.So if you are looking to buy an Xbox controller and are not being able to decide which,just go for this smaller one,Controller S without any hesitation.Quality hardware	pos
I received this toy as a gift for my 1-year old son. It was one of the most frustrating toys he's had. The handle requires too much strenght to press down, so he was not able to operate it alone. He could press it down only when standing up (using his body weight), but the size of the spinner made it very inconvinient to play this way: he had to lean and  crouch. The noise that the balls make is rather loud (in my consideration) and can irritate the adults after a while, too. Because my son was already walking, this static toy got very little attention. The positive features: it is made of sturdy plastic and the colors are nice and bright	neg

In the years I have taken this magazine, I have noted that often covered material becomes tomorrow's news from the latest hot-spot in the world.  So prescient, it is eery - if you have any interest in current events, news or foreign affairs, this journal is a must read.  The contributors are a Who's Who of politics, science and business in the world.  Often the author list will become the under-secretary of state list in the next administration.  For example, the last issue discussed Avian Flu virus.  As a physician, I can tell you that these were excellent informative articles that explained clearly what was happening and what the danger was.  And now this stuff is on TV every day and I can amaze my patients with how much I know about the issue that no one else does.  Reading this will definitely make you look smart.  Try this experiment and see if I'm right.  This article is written in October 2005, days after receiving the October issue with multiple articles about China written by Chinese authors.  Of course that means that these articles aren't really useful for facts so much as they are useful for seeing what China wants us to believe.  I predict that China will be much more in the news in the next 6 to 12 months.  So put this magazine to the test and see. ---  --- One negative is that although the authors are bi-partisan regarding party, they are not "conservative".  You won't ever find pro-tariff, anti illegal immigration, isolationist, anti judicial activism or pro-life articles in here.  Indeed, regardless of which party an author supports, you can pretty much count on expanded government, especially one-world government presented as the solution. ---  --- And lastly, some of the articles are deadly boring and contain stilted, obfuscated, diplomatic jargon.  You will rarely find a simple, eloquent phrase, but you will often find ideas that will pop up in any analysis of the news.  Just realize many of these authors are diplomats and politicians whose careers depend on obfuscation and plausible deniability. ---  --- All in all, this is an extremely influential journal that is full of cutting-edge ideas.  Just realize that many of them may be wrong	pos

The Pros: PDA, good mobile phone that really gets out, a camera for all those 'Kodak Moments', all packed in one for a good price --- The Cons: You'll need to get a replacement longer life battery (Seidio makes one), and the browser (Blazer) has MANY problems. ---  --- I'm very happy with the purchase of this smartphone. I've wanted a TREO for a few years but could never justify spending big bucks for one. You can work around the problems with the unit with new battery and browser software, it's a nice little phone. ---  --- I haven't bought a memory card for it, so I can't report on the mp3 capabilities, but I am going in that direction.

I have subscriptions to a few magazines, and I have to say, SEVENTEEN, is the one I'm always looking forward to. This magazine has a little bit of everything- fashion and make-up tips, how to be healthy (not just stick thin!), tips for school, fun (not very useful, but fun) stuff on guys and love, teen stories, and important information to be aware of. It's fun, but also informing.  ---  --- The models are normal girls, and this mag shows things that not only a size 0 or 2 girl can wear, but also clothing that can be worn by a girl who's size 4, 8, or 16. Many styles from girly to goth are shown, not just one. The clothing and accessories are also affordable, and can be found at stores in your nearby mall.  ---  --- SEVENTEEN isn't all fashion. It's really all about embracing who you are and making the most of life. It's about feeling good about yourself and loving yourself for who you are, and not what you aren't. I've used some of the tips on health, skin care, feeling good, and make-up, and you know what? They do work, and are actually helpful (***gasp***).  ---  --- The celebrity interviews are very good, and such that you can relate to them. The stories about things in teens' lives are also very good- some are sad, but they all make you aware of what really goes on out there. ---  --- It's a wonderful magazine. It doesn't have an overload of ads like Teen Vogue or Elle Girl, while still including fashion (though I will say not as much as these two mags, because these two are almost entirely all how to look good). SEVENTEEN however, has a bit more fashion than Teen People, Teen People having more stories and such (though it is right up there with SEVENTEEN). SEVENTEEN is a happy medium. It's an awesome magazine	pos

Because Vista uses so much memory and is already so huge, they had to drop quite a few little programs that software needs to access in the Operating system. ---  --- 2. HUGE MEMORY AND HARD DRIVE DRAIN.  --- Look at this comparison --- Windows XP Professional    Size on drive 1.5 gig    Memory requirements 128 MB ---  --- Windows Vista    Needs 15 GIG To Load. Does not say how large the program is but I wouldn't think its small!!! Memory requirements 1 GIG! ---  --- If you check the DELL website you will see that they recommend that you have 2 gig of memory to use Windows Vista. That is a few $$$ worth of memory just to run the operating system while openning a program. Try running a game or doing animation with that kind of a sink hole in your system! The less memory you have available, the slower everything, including websites will load (no matter how fast your internet connection)  ---  ---  What is worse is that to fix what is wrong with it (ie replace all those small programs your software expects to find in the operating system), they will have to ADD patches that can only make it bigger and hungrier for memory! ---  --- This is the most pathetic excuse for an upgrade that I have ever seen. I would expect some lawsuits before this is over! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT	neg
Muffet vs Spider! This is one cool looking figure and since the accessory spider is as big as Muffet makes it a kick butt scene. Again the turn is to the S&M pink & black leather bondage look, similar to the spiked outfit of Red Riding Hood. This is certainly not the image your mind conjures up to the nursery rhyme but it's a great display piece. The downfall from five stars is that when setup, Muffet is almost obscured by the spider. Both pieces look great in detail but a slightly different pose may have improved the figures	pos
Beautiful, stunning absolutely gorgeous. ---  --- A quick note to fellow Brits, this was ordered on October 22nd and arrived on November 1st and is much cheaper here than on amazon.co.uk or anywhere else in the UK!! I've ordered stuff domestically that has taken longer in the post!!	pos
The cable is exactly what I needed, and was much more inexpensive than other alternatives. Drivers provided on the accompanying CD worked but were not as complete as I would have liked.

I'll get to the plot of "The Gang's All Here" in a minute, because the --- plot isn't the most memorable part of this movie. The most memorable part is the bananas. ---  --- About 20 minutes into the movie, a towering hat of Technicolor fruitappears on the screen, followed by its owner--"Brazilian bombshell" Carmen Miranda. She proceeds to do a number called "The Lady in the Tutti-Frutti Hat," accompanied by chorus girls who bear bananas. Six-foot-tall bananas that continuously droop and sprout until number's end, when the chorus girls, worn out by the burden of this mutated fruit, lay down for a long siesta on a stage dressed up like an island. ---  --- There's a reason this number occurs so early on: It takes you the rest of the movie to convince yourself you actually saw this in a 1943 movie. ---  --- But then, this is Busby Berkeley, a director who staged his musical numbers as though he was declaring war. And next to kitsch, war is pretty much the motivator here. ---  --- The wafer-thin story involves Andy (James Ellison), a soldier who woos and wins Edie (Alice Faye), a canteen dancer, the nightbefore Andy goes off to World War Two. In what seems an instant, Andy gets decorated and returned home to a victory party thrown by the family of Andy's childhood sweetheart and fiancee--who, unfortunately for Edie, is not Edie.   --- Will the heartbreak be resolved? Do you really care? The plot is --- mostly an excuse for some snappy repartee between major '40s --- stars (in particular, Eugene Pallette and Edward Everett Horton are --- hilarious), and the kind of musical numbers that seem to drop out --- of thin air. (In a couple of scenes, Benny Goodman and his --- orchestra stroll by and do some songs just for the heck of --- it.) ---  --- "The Gang's All Here" is really a 1943 time capsule, but an --- eye-popping rouser of one. They don't make 'em like this anymore. --- They didn't make 'em much like this back then, either	pos
This product is great! I had always been a non believer but in the eight month with my second pregnancy when I could not take the strecth marks, the itching the pain the red skin, I used it and it was like magic.

These are great little toys, and my three year old is obsessed with them! He's getting most of them for Christmas, but we've already bought him a few. They're die cast, so they are a good weight, but note that some of them have plastic pieces as well. ---  --- Even though I like these toys, I'm only giving them two stars. This is a horrible price!! I honestly bought Sally today at my local K-Mart, and it was on sale for $2.89 (normally $3.19). Now I know when items are scarce and in high demand their price goes up, but this is a crazy markup. I understand that this is a third party seller, but Amazon should note with their sellers that there is a difference between mark up for high demand toys and rip offs. I have purchased Chick Hicks ($9.50) and Lizzie ($5.00) off of eBay, but I've been able to find the rest of the cars at my local Targets, Wal-Marts, K-Marts, etc. It takes time and searching, but it beats paying these prices	neg
I've been getting this magazine since it first came out years ago, and every issue is just as exciting as the first. It not only gives you the military aspect of events, but often goes into detail as to how and why these events occured, which is invaluable in itself. I can't wait for the next issue to come out, and wish it would come out more often. And the fact that it comes in hardcover format makes a nice presentation on my bookshelf. Thank you MH	pos

I got the Fusion razor in the mail a few weeks ago so I decided to give it a try.  At first it seemed ok, but I started noticing that it pulled at the hair on my face more than my Mach 3 turbo.  I decided to experiment and shave half of my face with a Mach 3 Turbo and the other half with the Fusion.  From my experience, the Mach 3 Turbo gave a closer shave, and glided much smoother across my skin than the Fusion.  I think the 5 blades on the Fusion are more of a gimmick than anything else.  And as cool as the single trimming blade is, it seems like Gillette had to include this because of the poor accuracy of having 5 blades.  In other words, the single blade is a fix rather than a feature.  My call is if your using a Mach 3 Turbo, don't waste your money on the Fusion	neg
I bought these slippers for my husband at Christmas time.  I thought if I  --- spent $50 on slippers they would last a long time, and be made very well. --- I was wrong.  The slippers look good, and the upper leather is very nice --- but the sole is a cheap, thin foam.  If you bend it, it snaps.  You would  --- expect to find this on a cheap, $2 flip flop.  I was very disappointed.  I bought my husband a cheap $2 pair of suede slippers in Walmart that were just as nice with a thick rubber sole. 	neg
I found this to be a absurd movie. It just has alot of things in it that are just too far-fetched, and the plot itself wasn't a strong one at that. To me it just seemed that it was trying to be a slapstick pirate movie, and it just didn't work. It tried to be a movie that all the family could watch, and it didn't work. It tried to be a disaster movie, and it didn't work. It tried to be a drama, and again it didn't work. I got a few chuckles out of it, it held my interest for maybe the 45 minutes to an hour that I watched it, but it was just sloppy, and uneven, and the best thing was watching most of the pirates in drag at the beginning.	neg

As a potential interior designer, I find that this magazine is both realistic and elegant in the articles it provides for the professional and for the hobbiest.  I have a subscription and I find that studying the designers, the styles and the themes I have learned so much about the work of a designer.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys color, fabrics or just pictures of beautifully designed rooms and interiors	pos
Contrary to the previous review, the majority of the patterns in the Fall/Winter 2005 issue were normal sizes (5'6").  This particular issue contains 10 jackets (two of which were for petites), four skirts (one of them petite), three pants (one petite), and four shells (two petites).  There were no dresses and no blouses with sleeves.  The interesting fabric choices and the superb fashion photography were also excellent.  This particular issue also had an article on how to change a petite pattern to a regular pattern and vice versa.  The pattern pieces have unique sophisticated shapes, very interesting for the intermediate to advanced sewer.  One thing I did find lacking was there was no casual sportswear.  The magazine seems geared toward business suits and formal occasions. 	pos
Whether you are a technical guru or someone who's emphasis is on the words, any serious filmmaker who takes his or her craft seriously will love American Cinematographer.  The official magazine of the American Society of Cinematographers, this magazine gives you in depth interviews with DPs and Directors on the technical approach towards the shooting of the picture.  They cover not just lab soups and lighting techniques, but also the approach to the script, design notes on how to visually approach the script - in other words, a great detailed overview of how this particular crew of filmmakers went about creating the visual language of the film.  And not just film - as technology advances, and more films are shot on video, this magazine gives the same great coverage to those pictures as well - from Star Wars to Anniversary Party.  While it's true that there are only so many films that AC can cover each issue but I think you'll end up feeling like I do - that I wish they could cover them all	pos

If you have an older systemworks loaded, NSW will go to remove the older GO BACK version.  If it does, (depending on your system) OK.  However, if it wants you to go to Symantek web site and download a GO BACK removal toll, beware.  I downloaded it and ran it and it stated it wanted to restart my system.  What it did was screw up the partition and crashed the system.  GO Back puts your data in a seperate partition.  Symantek knows about this and has a "fix" you run before loading NSW, but they didn't let anyone know that it may crash your system.  On an older PC, without windows restore tool, it works OK.  However, if you have a newer PC with a windows resotre loaded and then have an older NSW GO back loaded, it will crash your PC if you use their GO Back removal tool.  Emailed Symantec twice, they stated they would get back in 7 days - never did.  Hope you have better luc	neg
Every once in a while you come across a product that does just what you wanted it to.  The Snapstream remote is one of them. ---  --- I just recently built a home theater pc through which I play music and movies. However, the HTPC is in a different room than my projector and I needed a way to operate the pc remotely while in the theater room.  I chose the Snapstream remote for this function and have been well pleased. ---  --- I also highly recommend the Snapstream remote for those people using or looking to use the Beyond TV PVR solution.  I record all my favorite TV programs on my HTPC in high-def and able to access them with a single click of a button via the Snapstream remote. ---  --- This is one product that I can recommend with no reservations	pos
First off that has to be the worst rhyme I've ever heard in my life...  Andre Nickatina (in the rapping world) is one of the worst i've ever heard, but if you're into dope beats and his style in flowing with them (reminds me of someone on the ocean just being carried by waves, paddling every which way to stay with them), and what i mean by that is he tries to keep up with the pace and the beat and says (what feels like) every single thing that pops into his head from coke to what he had for dinner that night.  But overall, "if you can't dig it like its shovelled man i guess you ain't able" summs this and the rest of the Nickatina c.d.s up	neg

Most of the movie, the parts that work anyway, is like a visual kei band's music video, and it's nice to have that kewl aesthetic without the bad music that usually accompanies it. The movie's concept is something that could have only come from asia, where filmmakers seem to digest american influences and refashion them into something that seems to miss the whole point of what made the original ideas work. The kooky Face/Off being a prime example of this insanity. The cop movie setup seems like needless window dressing, anchoring the visually oriented fantasy content in a reality it needn't have any relevence to, but I guess even Alice In Wonderland, Labyrinth, and the Nightmare On Elm Street series used the device of having it be all in a dream. It's not a story driven movie and to grade it as such would be unfair. It's a surrealist visual art project, something that barely exists in cinema, and although it would be better placed in the context of some worthwhile characters and plot, it is making progressive and original use of the film medium. It's much like The Corpse Bride in that regard, except this film will weird you out with twists of random insanity instead of bore you with tedius monotony and musical numbers. Criticisms from one-star reviewers such as "pure eye candy, no story" couldn't be more accurate, but if you'd ever go to look at an art exhibit, this film is equally worth a look. 	pos
Following 2002's self-produced and underrated Under Rug Swept, Morissette returns in 2004 with So-Called Chaos. With this release, Morissette has done a complete makeover of her look with a serious haircut and sporting a look of casual glamour like she's aspiring to take Hollywood by strom but isn't 100% sure. Maybe the new look and image might have worked if Morissette's makeover in sound was good enough to go with it-but it's not. This CD starts out good with the opening cut "Eight Easy Steps," a fast-paced rockin' tune with Alanis at the wheel of leadership but also ready to bust her own chops at the same moment. "Out is Through" follows and also stands out, but then So-Called Chaos begins to turn problematic by not having an edge. And Morissette should never have brought John Shanks or Tim Thorney(or both)on board for assistance because she was left with bland arrangements behind many of the tracks. "Doth I Protest Too Much" is without a doubt the worst song Alanis has ever recorded. The title song attempts for a gritty and gutsy feel but even that attempt becomes overshadowed by Morissette's lyrics(yes, not her best work)when she refers to heartburn, headaches, and breached contracts as primary results of a chaotic lifestyle. The tracks continue with "All of Me," and "This Grudge," both rather dull, while the closing track "Everything" was a weak choice for the first single. Morissette has always been a progressive artist, but So-Called Chaos doesn't measure up to any of its predecessors, and may leave many fans longing to see the girl with the jagged heart still spinning with her free-flowing locks firmly in place.	neg

This item was very nice.  The chain was longer than I expected and hangs really low on my neck, but it only looks like the real one.

Terry's son, Nile, has honored his father (and done the rest of us a huge favor) by publishing this collection of the best of Terry's shorter works. ---  --- Terry concluded at one point that film had surpassed literature as the communication medium of choice, and devoted most of the rest of his life to that arena. His interview "On Screenwriting" describes both the benefits and the frustrations associated with that choice. His advice is just as relevant to the would-be screenwriter today as it was when he wrote it. ---  --- His "Proposed Scene for Kubrick's Rhapsody," and "Plums and Prunes," provide interesting examples of proposed movie scenes that will prove interesting to readers unfamiliar with that arcane art. ---  --- As other reviewers have noted, "Grooving in Chi" is an excellent description of the Chicago riots during the Democratic National Convention in 1968. ---  --- Finally, pieces like "The Beautiful-Ugly Art of Lotte Lenya," "When Film Gets Good," "Rolling Over Our Nerve-Endings [William Burroughs]," and "Writers at Work [Henry Green]" prove that he could write serious criticism. ---  --- Through it all flows that wonderful, irreverent, sense of humor. ---  --- Good stuff	pos
This dispenser is easy to install and works perfectly every time. After initially filling the dispensers, it took several pumps for the product to dispense but after that it comes out on the first push of the button.

It also saves on my shampoo because the kids just push the button twice to dispense the amount they need instead of pouring shampoo out of the bottles and using more than they need	pos

MariaS and Srayle, if you like the Guaraldi original then keep it and chuck the Winston,  Personally, I think the Winston performance is refreshing and a delightful 'twist' on Guaraldi's works.

It should be emphatically understood, you are buying Winston in this case, and not Guaraldi.  I have both versions	pos
Yes, it's easy to install, configure and use. The footprint is small and it doesn't hog resources. That's the good news. The bad news is that this software's virus detection rate is abysmal and the company's tech support is worse. So, in short, don't *trust* it.  ---  --- Two examples, starting with tech support. After building a new computer, I had several blue screens (stop errors, BSODs) and my analysis seemed to indicate that EZ Antivirus was at least partially responsible. I emailed support with all the relevant info. Their (paraphrased) reply: "We understand that you are having Faults in Windows. This is because you have Windows installed. If you did not have Windows you would not have Faults. Thank you for contacting E-Trust." I should have that engraved on a plaque.  ---  --- Example 2, AV detection: When my subscription ran out, I uninstalled EZ and tried a demo of Kaspersky. It found 5 viruses on my computer that EZ never told me about. In this case, it's 2 strikes and you're out. Goodby, Computer Associates	neg

I bought this item after much research and this particular model was suggested to me by a friend.  No problems at all with shipping; package was in perfect shape though only delivered to my back steps.  I opened up the box and brought in pieces individually, with the flywheel being the heaviest (though I was able to bring in myself).  It took me about 2 hours to put together.  Instruction book was better than most I have seen, and only problem was the misprint in bolt sizes, but you can figure that out easily (as everyone has noted on their reviews).  The elliptical's size is on the smaller size and fits well in my sitting room.  Easily moved if need be. --- In regards to the workout.  I cross train on my treadmill and found this workout to be as effective.  There are a variety of programs so you can vary your workout.  The backward motion is a little awkward for me (I am 5'3") but found that holding onto the lower handlebars works well (versus the movable upper ones).  The machine is very quiet, only slight squeeking coming from the upper handlebars that disappeared with a little WD40.  It has very smooth movement and you can definitely tell a difference with increasing the level, which I was worried about as it doesn't have an incline as some gym machines do.  The heel rise can occur when you do not sit back on your heels when working out, so you just need to be aware of your foot placement.  The foot pads are comfortable and a good size.   --- Most of all, for those who do monitor their heart rate, I have a Polar F11 heart monitor (with chest strap) and this monitor is within a 3 beat difference at the most.  I recommend to let the monitor read for a minumum of 45 seconds before you follow the rate.  This held true for me even if pacing at 70 RPM's or above.  I listen to my IPOD when I work out, so I have not used the book holder.  The water holder holds 24 oz Polar Spring bottles without any difficulty taking out and replacing the bottle. --- I highly recommend this for anyone who is looking at increasing their fitness level in the comfort of their own home.  It's very well built/solid, quiet, effective, and affordable ($599, free pad, free shipping)	pos
Overall a nice product, powerful, good looking, but with a few quirks.  Feed/auto on mechanism a little picky as to the angle that you insert your paper.  Recommend putting entire unit in a big trash bag when emptying, otherwise shredded bits go flying to the floor.  Make sure to put the lid on the basket in proper orientation or motor won't run; look for the little metal rail on the inside top right of the basket, if it's not there rotate the basket 180 degrees and then put the top on.  	pos

Well you know the rest. Aside from her brash repetative demeanor her cooking has a lot to be desired. These meals CANNOT be done in 30 minutes, unless that is if you want everything half cooked. The book makes false promises and does not deliver.

If you want good food and a good cook book don't buy into the hype and don't buy this book.	neg
I've owned a pair of 587s for 18 months, wearing them exclusively as walking shoes full-time in the summer and very little the rest of the year. While the shoes are comfortable, I was disappointed at how fast they're falling apart. The padding around the ankle has torn, there are small holes in the top of the toe box from my big toes, and I was surprised to see the description of these shoes on this website to include the statement, "The solid rubber outsole delivers long-wearing durability." That's been my major complaint with these shoes; shortly after I got them, the soles cracked at the heel, and now layers of the soles are peeling off. ---  --- I recommend buying another model..	neg

I definitely can tell when a great game show can be fun as a board game. Unfortunately, that absolutely isn't always the case. One of my all time favorite quiz shows back in the 80's was Super Password with Bert Convy. The game of course showcases a celebrity and a regular contestant trying to guess their way to guess a mystery word for a puzzle. This edition doesn't reflect on that edition. This board game edition is a example of the original Password with the late Allen Ludden. The game is still fun and enjoyable for those who actually haven't seen the original Password like myself, but it is just delightful. Unfortunately, it isn't much fun reflecting on this version and relating to the Bert Convy edition. Hopefully, when Password is remade, it will be just like the themed 80's edition of the NBC game show. ---  --- Price: B- ---  --- Game: C 1/2+ ---  --- Fun & Enjoyment: B- ---  --- Overall: C	pos
First impressions: It's a nice watch with a clear look. I was a little worried about the lack of backlighting, but was pleasantly suprised that I was able to see the luminescent dials clearly at any hour of the night. ---  --- Pros: Quick atomic time synchronization (usually within one to two minutes after the initial synchronization). Simple to use.  ---  --- Cons: Case is described as stainless steel, but back piece is plastic. Originally listed by Amazon as a solar-powered watch, but instead powered by regular battery. Battery life expectancy about 2 years, though it may lost longer by disabling the auto-sync feature. ---  --- Overall comments: This is my first atomic time wrist-watch. It automatically synchronizes with atomic time once at midnight (a function you can disable if desired) or on-demand with the press of a button or two. It does this by scanning for a radio signal. According to the instructions, you're supposed to leave this watch near a window with the 6-o'clock side facing the window for best radio-signal reception. Reception can of course vary depending on your location, but the watch has successfully updated several times even while I was wearing it. --- I like watches with flat crystal surfaces, because it allows me to paste a PDA screen-proctector (cut to size, of course) on them, which keeps the crystal from scratching. The crystal on this watch is only slightly curved, and in only one direction, meaning a screen protector sticks nicely and evenly to it. --- The watch is waterproof to 50 meters, which (in Casio terms) means you can go swimming with it, but you should not press any buttons underwater. I try to keep my watches away from water when I can, but it's always good to know that it should survive most water-related mishaps	pos

For those not aware, Pumpkinhead 2 is (supposedly) the 1994 sequel to 1988's timeless monster classic, Pumpkinhead. The original was darkly creepy, superbly constructed in it's story, and featured a wonderfully original costume for the creature. Pumpkinhead 2 fails at being slightly horrorific, butchers the story, and basically uses the name and a simliar creature-suit to create an otherwise completely irrelevant "sequel". It's like a group of writers saw a picture of Pumpkinhead on the internet, read his name (and that's ALL they read), and decided to make their own movie. As for the plot (if anyone cares), a deformed boy dies and comes back as a monster to exact revenge on the people who hurt his feelings. I'll admit, if they had altered the look of the creature a bit and had chosen a different name for the movie, this would've been worth two or three stars as a "so bad it's good" B flick. But the fact that they totally butchered the original by attempting to connect this garbage to it really kills it. If you haven't seen 1988's Pumpkinhead, rent it or buy it -- it's a horror masterpiece (especially compared to this) with so much going for it. But avoid this sequel at all costs. I hate to put down any product, but I feel that this one deserves it	neg
This rangefinder is great! Much lighter than the big bulky other units. Has all the great features that is needed.

This program sucks. I used it last year and thought that it was unwieldy and really confusing (i.e. unlike TurboTax and other programs, there's very little transparency in the system). Then I bought it again this year because the store that I went to was out of Turbotax, and I needed to get my taxes done quickly. This year was even worse than last year - not only was it still unwieldy and irritating, but it gave me figures that simply did not make sense.  The results for the federal return were OK, but it gave me figures that would have cost me over $2,000 in taxes that I did NOT owe on my state return. I ended up going online to double check my results using a cheap ($10) online service recommended by the NY state tax website. Within 45 minutes, I cleared the online source, and got results that made far more sense. I have no idea what happened with TaxCut, but I suspect that they may have been missing a field somewhere along the line - this is a problem that has been noted by a number of others in reviews on a variety of sites. I will NOT be buying this product again	neg

Long time MSL subscriber.  I get out my dec, dec/jan issues every holiday season to see what works for ornaments and decorations and such.  I loved the cookie issue last year, definite keeper.  Her projects involve time and materials, but you end up with something that will last, and instructions are generally very clear.  I've seen that since her trial/jail, the high end advertisors have almost entirely backed out, which means adds for average joes, like me.  I really appreciate the depth that the mag goes into a certain subject, even if its not a particular fave of mine.  --- I haven't really watched the Martha show much, I really enjoyed the original MSL show she started with.

  I am a traveling songwriter and just finished a 6000+ mile tour from Nebraska to Florida with this on the top of my Subaru and I must say it was great thing to have- everything stayed bone-dry and secure but I would recommend usuing a couple of extra bungee cords across the top just as an added measure- plenty of room and solid construction- for the price it can't be beat	pos
Our daughter got one of these for Christmas. She's taken it out twice on pavement and the rear wheel (which is make out of plastic) broke. I regret paying what I did for this one, not because of what the going price is now but because it's a piece of junk. ---  --- DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP	neg
This was a gift for my 2 year old last christmas.  The screws they provide to put the wheels on are no good. As soon as your child starts "walk" his new dog, the wheels completely unscrew, which can be a terrible choking hazzard.  We have tried everything to keep them on.  Plus the leash tore off from around poor spot's neck, and no type of glue seems to keep it on. I'm afraid this cute little toy is going into the trash. It was good idea and a cute toy, but not worth the money. You're better off buying a plastic, already put together one.	neg
The thing wouldn't even fit around my handle bar; I had to zip-tie it on.  A waste of $$. 	neg
I don't know why most of the reviews are so negative.  Mine works perfectly, it does not flip-flop, does not drop down and you can remove those thingies inside to make the water pressure higher for a more soothing shower experience. ---  --- Reason I gave it 4 stars is because I have what is called a "diverter valve" attached to my shower head.  The waterpik is meant to be installed DIRECTLY onto the shower head itself.  I could not do that, because I have a portable "wand" that is moveable via hose connected to the valve and noticed that the threading is too short for the waterpik to latch on to. ---  --- Went to Home Depot and got an extension and a coupling, kind of ingenious and used lots of pipe tape to "interface" the waterpik via the extension, via the coupling ONTO the diverter valve..... Wow!  NO LEAKS!  Works PERFECTLY. ---  --- For those of you out there that has a diverter valve for more then one showerhead option, go to Home Depot, Lowe's or a hardware store and what I wrote above will work as it did for me. ---  --- Enjoy	pos

Man, these things are good.  I used to eat Pop-Tarts all the time, but it eventually got to the point that a) I got tired of Pop-Tarts and b) they seemingly just stopped making them like they used to.  Instead of being good and soft like they're supposed to be, Pop-Tarts morphed into hard pastries that felt and tasted like they had been left out in the air for a couple of days.  These new Go-Tarts, at least the frosted strawberry ones, are just right - soft pastries with just the right amount of strawberry inside them to give you that elusive strawberry twang taste (some of you may know what I'm talking about here).  These things are ready to eat right out of the pack - so "ready to eat," in fact, that there's a message on each package stating that you should not put them in a toaster or microwave.  If you're the daredevil sort and insist on breaking Kellogg's prescribed rules, I can't stop you - but don't blame me if your microwave explodes or something.   ---  --- Of course, one little 1.2 oz. bar isn't enough for anyone bigger than a Chihuahua puppy, so volume is an important factor here, which is where these multi-pack boxes come in so handy.  With 140 calories per bar, I don't guess these things will be making any of Jenny Craig's diet plans any time soon, but I say life's too short - eat all you want.  And, with these individually wrapped bars, you won't face the classic Pop-Tart dilemma of having to choose between eating two pastries now or putting one back in the box, knowing that it will taste even more stale later because you've already freed it from its freshness-preserving little tinfoil wrapper thingy	pos

I have to start with by saying that I am indeed a very happy user of T600 for almost two years. IIts user friendliness and sheer wealth of applications and uses still keeps me excited.  The device can be used for phone calls, calendars, web browsing, email, IM (ICQ, AOL, etc .. ),  internet radio stations, document editing, games, modem for the laptop... and that is just the beginning. ---  --- So why only two stars?? and why poor execution?  Very poor voice call quality, reported by many and totally unacceptable!!!  Luckily for me and some others; one of the internet enthusiast came up with the solution -- open up the unit and isolating the mic wire with the foil.  It worked, but it should never had to be necessary. ---  --- Also screens are week.  Drop on the hard service will break it.  Luckily for	neg
Set up was easy. Just read the manual and follow the instructions. Don't take short cuts. ---  --- Forcasting is excellent after setting the barometer to match local conditions. We live over 1,000 feet above sea level. Adjusting for that was needed. Weather.com's zip code oriented barometric pressure info made that relatively easy. ---  --- The screen is easy to read and understand. The main unit has a solid feel and does not look cheap. ---  --- The external humidity and temperature sensor fits easily between a closed window and it's screen. ---  --- The manual could be more complete. It wasn't clear that the icon that depicts a connection with the national time service doesn't appear until after the first connection is made in the wee hours of the morning. When you manually set the clock make sure you do it in 24 hour mode. Then, switch to 12 hour mode if that is what you want displayed. Again, the manual should have pointed that out	pos
I had viewed concert photos taken with the S2 from a number of different photographers and they absolutely took my breath away. Saw the output of other cameras in comparison and they didn't even come close. ---  --- I was using the Canon A80 prior and while I was happy with it, my first round of photos with the S2 proved to be most impressive. While you can use this as a point and shoot, this is a camera that you should spend some time learning so that you can get the most from it. And although the S3 is the latest version of the camera, I'm not sure you get that much more for the money	pos
In 2 weeks, I will actually be at the Vatican for my first visit.This wonderful DVD showed me places and things that I will never be able to see as a tourist, but just knowing about the workings of the Vatican will add such a richness of knowledge to visit.

I bought this croquet set late last summer for backyard get-togethers with the neighbors. None of us had played before, so we didn't need top-of-the-line, and the price was right on this set. It's everything it needs to be: weighty, colorful, and compact in its case. The widgets are pretty bendy, but if they bend out of shape, they bend right back. Turned out to be a good investment. A word of warning if you have small dogs: put them in the house before you let your neighbors loose with mallets and round projectiles. My little dachshund picked up the bad habit of chasing the balls and pushing them further off-course. It was funny, until she darted into the path of one bright orange ball, which made solid contact with her little head. (She's fine now, but is no longer a fan of the game.) All in all, I would highly recommend having a set like this around if you have the room in your backyard and fun neighbors	pos
My husband purchased the Pedometer with FM radio for me.  I loved it and used it non-stop for about a week.  After a week the battery case top fell off so I could not keep the batteries in.

Richard Fortney's "Earth" is a survey, in mostly layman's terms, of the geological history of the Earth and how it relates to humankind.  Fortney tells the story by means of a journey around the earth, selecting a series of locations where the earth's geology is apparent, and usually the meaning of that geology was debated by scholars to a greater understanding.   ---  --- Fortney starts at Mount Vesuvius in Italy, preceeds to the Hawaiian Islands, hence to the Swiss Alps and to other locations aroudn the world.  Fortney relates the geology of each chosen location to plate tectonics as a means to explain how each terrain come to be the way it is.  This leads into extended and sometimes fascinating discussions of the former alignements of the continents in prior ages such as the "supercontinent" of Gondwana.  For each location, Fortney also relates the effects of the terrain on the history of the humans who have lived in that location.  Along the way, Fortney drives home the sheer vastness of the timescale of earth and its geological processes.  The dedicated reader will view his landscape with a new perspective. ---  --- Fortney is a gifted writer with a good eye for the illustrative anecdote.  Large portions of this book will be fascinating to the reader with at least some schooling in the sciences.  It turns out, for example, that the complicated geology of Newfoundland results from its origin as pieces of three different tectonic plates (North America, ocean bottom, and Northern Europe).  The descriptions of Northwest Scotland as the remains of truly ancient mountains are put into appropriate scale in part by Fortney's historical anecdotes and by his experiences of rockhounding in the often cold rainy weather of the Scottish Highlands. ---  --- The narrative runs a little long at over 400 pages, and Fortney's explanations will sometimes outrun the scientific background of the average reader.  Nevertheless, this book is highly recommended to the reader with at least a casual interest in geology and its links to human history	pos
Classy look and very durable. Very nice watch for the price. I bought mine at a discount store and paid about $6 more for it. I like it, despite its 10mm thickness. Not that heavy if you're like me, 6'2" and 250lbs. It's a man's watch, practical yet with some style while not being trendy. I haven't had any problems with it so far, despite having dropped it twice and worn it outside while working and getting it soaked with sweat multiple times. I don't find it uncomfortable at all and I forget I am wearing it. (I suggest taking it off, the leather band doesn't clean easily like a metal band.) I'm considering buying a second one and keeping it cleaner this time. (Lesson learned.	pos

I received this as a Christmas gift and thought, "Why not... I'll try it."  The woman who bought the gift for me also has one and told me NOT TO APPLY ANY PRESSURE when using the device.  As a redhead, I have extremely sensitive, thin skin so I followed her advice very carefully.  I did not apply any pressure what-so-ever, and didn't keep the device in one area for too long.  The result..... worse than any sunburn I've ever had!  My legs are burned in various areas, as the product sanded off the first layer of my skin!  The skin hardened and has begun to crack in the burned areas.  I'm a little concerned and think I should call my physician, as the condition is extremely painful.  Worst of all, the hair grew back immediately the next day and I had to shave the areas that were not burned.  This is a terrible, dangerous product!  	neg

Extremely difficult to dig through the excessive examples in order to find the relevant theorems and results.

Read the reviews and picked the elephant for my 17m old child's nusery. I absolutely love it. Before this, my son could not sleep well with our "family's" humiifier because it was too noisy. Within an hour of bringing this home, it was set up (very easily) and he took one of many 2 1/2 hour naps that week! No filters, No noise, NO PROBLEMS thus far! I did have it on high for the first 20 mins and found a puddle of water underneath, but the humidifier was near a window, and i am asumming there was a draft that may have directed the steam toward the dresser top. (The problem was resolved once moved unto a different surfacetop) Filling it is a snap and the very fine mist (looked like small stream of fog) was a pleasure to see out of the trunk of the animal! The tank seems to last longer than the box states. It is on it's third day on a low/med setting and it still only has a 3 inch difference at the top. I love the safety features and I don't have to worry about the tank still on if it's empty since it has an automatic shut off! The light is not a problem since he likes to have a tiny bit of light in his room. It is a design that will last thoughout his childhood! Thank you Crane!	pos

Many of my colleague use blackberry for emails but I give a try on this brand-new 3G/Wi-fi/camera equipped smartphone.  The 3G and Wi-fi works very well in our area.  It also worked very well in Europe after activation of the cellphone by Cingular customer service.  E-mail and internet works very well in both locations.  Addition of 1GB microSD chip actually solve many of the bluetooth file transfer issues, since I can simply stick the microSD card into regular SD cassette, and use a card reader and USB cable for file transfer from PC or Mac like other memory chips.  The color calibration and default focus of the camera is very good and video is very good quality for the cameraphone.  Again, 1GB allow you to take a very long video in Windows Media Player format.  Installation of Good mail system automatically synchronize to Lotus Note emails, contacts, and calendar any time, any place, and automatically chime schedule notices. The only drawback are the battery life, which require frequent charges, slow keypad for phone calls (and I do not know how to silence the keypad), and a little tough keyboard touch.  Lack of shift keys on both sides sometimes makes key typing difficult (especially shift+A !).  In addition, Microsoft Word processing is slow, and so as Excel, which will require a faster chip. Overall, a great all-around pocket PC in this generation	pos

This movie was just plain bad. It doesn't just stink, it reeks. If I was to say this movie was horrible that would be a compliment. ---  ---  I can't believe that the other reviews were so complimentary. It's the reason why I purchased the movie and I regret my decision.  ---  --- I should have read the reviews more closely. Some of the reviewers hadn't acutally seen the film while I am convinced that a few of the other reviews were written by people associated with the film.  ---  --- Everything about this movie is sup-par. The script was horrible. The sets amateurish. The dialogue stilted. (And not in the funny style reminiscent of the TV series - which I loved). There are a number of things about the movie that were warning signs that this movie was going to stink. ---  --- First the only footage they used was from the Batman movie. Not the TV series. I have a feeling that the people who have the rights to the TV series realized that this movie was so bad they didn't want to associate themselves with it. They didn't use the original Batmobile but a cheap rip off. I could continue by why make you suffer. ---  --- The chemistry between Adam West and Burt Ward is non-existent. And the chemistry between the `actors' playing Adam West and Burt Ward in the `flashback' scenes is substandard at best.  ---  --- This movie is beyond dreadful. There are cameos from a few villains from the original TV show but they're dreadful too. Not because they are bad actors but because the script and plot are that bad. I wish I could say I laughed. I wish I could say that I at least cracked a smiled but unfortunately all I can say is that I watched this movie in dead silence.  ---  --- DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME ON THIS MOVI	neg

As the reviews below indicate, "Arthur" has a lot of fans -- when it was released in 1981 Vincent Canby of the New York Times found it a wonderful "screwball comedy" (although over time, Times readers, perhaps more discerning than Vincent, have only rated it 3 out of 5 stars) and Bravo listed it #10 on its list of Best Comedies (see below). I first saw Dudley Moore in "Foul Play," thought he was very funny. Based upon that, I bought "10" and "Arthur," as it turned out a downward trajectory. ---  --- What I dislike about "Arthur" is Moore playing a loud, obnoxious drunk telling unfunny jokes, and Minelli playing a salt-of-the-earth working girl who loves Arthur for himself, not for his $750 million fortune. Even John Gielgud, who was great in "The Loved One" a much better comedy, can't resurrect this turkey. ---  --- Okay, folks. Start casting your negative votes.

I ordered this pack after my friend's baby shower, she received this as a gift and I was amazed at how nice it was.  It fit both her and her husband very well, so I ordered one to carry our 7 month old daughter in.  WE love it.  It is easily adjustable and fits my husband and myself great.  Our daughter squeals in delight whenever she is in it, it has made our walks more enjoyable, I have free hands to hold our dogs' leashes and she likes being up to see everything.  I only have one complaint and that is the pocket on the belt is almost impossible to access when wearing the pack, but it is so minute of a complaint I still give it 5 stars.  Oh yeah the price is amazing for the pack you get, I cannot wait to go on a day hike.  I had been pricing other packs and they were close to $200, this was$90 w/ free shipping, a huge price break, plus I got it in about 3 days, thanks Amazon	pos

Lamp is nice.Gives excellent lighting for desk work.Buying Partners,LLC was very good in handling a lamp that had problems with the bulb not staying on.The only downsize to owning this lamp is that the 13 Watt bulb can only be purchased at select stores .Seems like discount stores don't carry them.Also,replacement bulbs are expensive( most likely it would be cheaper to just replace the whole lamp than just the bulb).Some reviews on the bulb say that it does not last as long as the 10,000 hours advertised. --- Having said all that,go ahead and purchase the lamp.At the price you can't go wrong.Merry Christmas To All 	pos

I bought this item on my own because I read the wonderful reviews it received. I really don't know HOW this item can be used. Even if you don't use the air-vented cups (which collect the leaking milk), you can plainly see the soft shells in loose clothing.

Straps on this shoe are very short and since they close with velcro, they are too short.  I tried to add velcro, but that didn't work.  I had to give the shoes away.

I ordered this product for more than what its new price is on December 21, 2006 as a Christmas present for my mother. It didn't arrive until January 9th, and it arrived damaged!  We sent it back for a refund.  On February 2nd, this low-rate item arrived at our doorstep again, AFTER I checked several times by phone to make sure that my order was marked as a RETURN and not an EXCHANGE.  We decided to set it up and see if this one was better.  STILL DAMAGED in another area. I have called The Sharper Image over ten times now over a span of 2 months. I know their customer service number by heart, and I even know their direct customer service number (without having to go through the machine) by heart (call 1-888-344-5555 instead of 1-800...). Their shipment is slow and their processing is painfully slow! They've given me 3 different order numbers without telling me, so I couldn't get accurate information about my order online.  Beware of dealing with this company.  If you can, go into a Sharper Image store somewhere, take the thing out of its box to examine it, and only then consider bringing this product into your house.  One good thing is that they do give you a full refund, tax included.  At least that's what they told me by phone today.  By the way, this should be called a Foldaway Strider, not Elliptical.  It absolutely does not have the elliptical wheel or power that other more functional elliptical machines do	neg
This a wonderful movie. I had never seen it before. I am 65 and was a teenager in the fifties and an avid movie goer. Some of these old black and white films bring back memories of a time when life seemed to begin every moment. It was a time after the war and people were just beginning to discover each other. The old Italian movies had a grittiness to them. A reality from far away places where life just had a different style. La Strada and the Nights of Cabiria were from this time. I feel such a pull watching them, wishing things had never become so modern. The Bicycle Thieves belongs in this catagory. The reproduction is marvelous. Clean and smooth. I am glad that this movie has been restored. Its a beautiful piece of the past.	pos
I've only had this scale for a short time, but so far so good.  I've found that in order to get a scale that is perfect or near perfect you have to spend a boat load of money. As someone before has mentioned the one drawback to this scale is that you have to set it back to zero every so often.  I specifically wanted to get an analog scale for this reason, with an inexpensive digital scale, which is what I had last, you can't reset it like you can an analog.  This scale is a great buy, for only $10 how can you go wrong!	pos

Although easy to load a smart card, this viewer was disappointing in quality.  My pictures look fine on my computer, but the pictures were dark and there was no instruction on how to change the contrast etc. (although I found that it the picture could be adjusted, it was never mentioned in the manual).  The manual is, because of the comment above, disgustingly incomplete. If not going through the bother of returning it through Amazon because I purchased it on line, I would not have kept it.  I actually bought another digital frame that was smaller and cheaper and it was worse, otherwise I would have given it only one star.  I could have purchased a unit a Circuit City or BestBuy and been better off	neg
I bought a sweatshirt from them--the tote was a "freebie" and too small for much use anyway. ---  --- Customer service was awful. They sent me the wrong size--a man's size, not the woman's I was searching for (and the photo had a woman wearing it!  She must have been an Amazon).  I returned it the next day and they REFUSED to accept the return, saying it looked worn	neg
This is one of the only things I have every bought sight unseen on Amazon.  This canopy is very well made and a breeze to set up and put away.  The carrying case on wheels is an extra bonus	pos
The suction cups were bent and just did not stick to the high chair or anything else for that matter.  My 6 month old daughter just likes to play with the animals - they crinkle and delight her. 	neg
I gave this pedometer one star because it is not for anyone who wants to use it straight off of the shelf.  This pedometer can work if you do not mind working on it.  It has problems that need modification.   ---  --- The top of the clip on this pedometer pushes against the body, making the vertical angle 20 degrees or more off of plumb.  That means the weighted arm inside drags on the circuit board and does not move freely.  Remove the factory clip and the tabs that hold it.  Add some adhesive Velchro to the back of the case.  Make a fabric band for your ankle.  Attach the ends to each other with Velchro.  Put a strip of Velchro on the outside of the band for attaching the pedometer to the band.  I get  accurate readings with this pedometer when it is attached to the inside of my right ankle.  I got inconsistent readings with it on my waistline.    ---  --- The hair spring that returns the weighted arm to its upright position weakened considerably after about ten miles and the pedometer drastically undercounted.  I opened the pedometer and added a strut to brace the spring.  The strut is made of thin brass.  Aluminum from a soda can would work, too.  I made a "V" in one end of the strut to hold the spring.  I pushed lightly against the spring from the left side, drilled a hole in the brass, and anchored the strut to a screw on the lower left part of the circuit board.  The strut angles up just slightly from the screw that anchors it.  I now have quite a few miles on the pedometer.  (I have a theory the spring weakened because its solder joint to the circuit board may have broken slightly and allowed the spring to twist freely.) ---  --- Several times the pedometer reset itself to "0" for no apparent reason.  I know nothing pushed on the reset button.  One incident was while it was going through the scanner at airport security.  Once it reset while I was walking.  Twice it reset while I was napping on the sofa.  I am thinking a charge of static electricity overwhelmed the circuit, but I do not know.  Static electricity from too many synthetic fabrics can be a problem with more expensive pedometers, too.   ---  --- This pedometer uses a counter circuit.  If someone needs an inexpensive electronic counter, connect a wire to the weighted arm and another wire to the coiled spring it contacts.  Connect a button switch to the two wires.  Freeze the weighted arm in place with hot glue	neg
The original battery never lasted an entire day if I talked very much.  With this replacement battery, I never run out of power anymore.  I do charge it every night. The battery is a little bit thicker than the OEM but it causes no problems when carrying it on the belt clip.  The new battery comes with a new battery door that matches and fits perfectly	pos
Very  Satisfied easy to load and very easy to use.I started using it as soon as I loaded it with out reading the help or tutorial. I really like the ease of use and the quality of the invoices it produced. I had Quick books a few years ago and the new one is much more user friendly. I highly recomend this program for anyone running a small Business	pos
This book has too many errors. There is nothing more frustrating than to follow the steps outlined and find out it does not work because they did not Q&A the examples. ---  --- ie. They ask you to select a field from the table, but the field does not exist. The stored procedure does not include it. ---  --- You would have to know how to write SQL to correct this	neg

This is a beautiful piece. Very substantial and unusual! The only thing that would have made it better is if it had been made with a bigger bail so it could accommodate larger chains than the neckwire it comes on. Regardless, it was well worth the price	pos
Relationships and drug use are major themes.  This album starts off with two absolute killer tunes, lets down some but has a joy thoughout.  I can't believe this is going to be his only album.....what a shame.  From someone who has been listening to rock for a long time, I tell ya, this is a blast.  Pure fun.  Something you might want to give to someone you have broken up with as its full of a broken heart and the joy of being in love.....mostly rather quickly paced.  One of my favorite albums of the 90s.  More people should listen	pos
This thermometer is terrific. It works quickly and the handle is long enough that you don't burn yourself on the heat from the coals. I highly recommend this product	pos

I am married to a native New Yorker and we spent an entire weekend looking over this book and talking about many of the wonderful places it mentions, many of which we still visit today. As an extra bonus for avid cooks, there are recipes. For anyone who remembers Luchows or any of the other venerable, now closed restaurants the book mentions, it will take you back to happy times and good memories. It's an excellent book and clearly Schwartz has poured a great deal of research into what is his labor of love.	pos

This is a nice compact hardback edition of Dashiell Hammett's five novels, which he wrote between 1929 and 1934. A veteran of Pinkerton detective agency in several cities, Hammett turned his intimate familiarity with crooks, low-lives, and the seedier side of life into hard-boiled, hard-hitting detective stories. This was a time when urban corruption was the rule, and private detectives, journalists, and police officers shared information. Two of these novels, "The Maltese Falcon" and "The Glass Key" are American classics. Another, "The Thin Man", inspired one of Hollywood's best-loved movie franchises. Hammett's novels lift the veil of propriety from the subcultures in which they take place, laying bare violence, corruption, and pervasive cynicism. But they're not dreary. The sharp prose crackles, and the heroes stand apart from the corruption while swimming in it, steadfast in their own codes of conduct, their iconoclastic ideologies rooted securely in realism. These five novels all appeared as serials in magazines prior to being published as novels. "The Thin Man" appeared first in "Redbook", the others in "Black Mask". ---   ---  "The Maltese Falcon" (1930) and "The Glass Key" (1931) are flawless. "The Maltese Falcon" features private detective Sam Spade, a irresistible femme fatale, and the ruthless pursuit of an ancient gold statuette. The last pages of the book are some of the most hard-hitting and cynical in all of noir fiction. And they're brilliant. "The Glass Key" explores political corruption that leads to personal tragedy in an unnamed American city. Oddly, the detective is the right-hand man of a crime boss. "Red Harvest" (1929) features the adventures of Hammett's most popular detective, the Continental Op, in a town called Personville, or Poisonville to those who know it better. The always unnamed detective for the Continental Detective Agency finds himself responsible for cleaning up a mining town that is ruled by violence and mob warfare. The novel's opening paragraph deserves to be read several times. "The Thin Man" (1934) is an attempt at humor among New York's blue-blooded, cold-blooded upper crust. Hard-boiled humor is interesting in concept. But I find the characters in this novel more pitiful than funny, and Hammett's style was in decline at this point. At least his characteristic cynicism wasn't. "The Dain Curse" (1929) is another Continental Op novel. This one is melodramatic, absurd, and not up to Hammett's usual standards. Hammett fans shouldn't miss it, but others may find it pointless. I described the novels in order of descending quality. "Complete Novels" organizes them chronologically. ---   ---  Five novels is a lot to pack into one book. But "Complete Novels" doesn't resemble a door stop. It's a handy size actually. The print is not too small, but the pages are quite thin. Editor Stanley Marcus, a literary critic and frequent admirer of Hammett's work, has included a Chronology of Hammett's life and several pages of notes on the novels in the back of the book. The chronology is informative and provides all of the apparently significant events in Hammett's life. The notes are mostly definitions of colloquialisms used in the novels, which are useful. The notes also contain an introduction to "The Maltese Falcon", written by Hammett in 1934, in which he explains the origins of that novel's characters. It's quite interesting. For those who prefer to own these novels separately, Vintage Crime/Black Lizard hs published some handsome trade paperback editions. But if you want hardback and don't mind all five novels in one volume, this is quite a nice book	pos
When I first started reading this magazine back in 2003 I thought "Oooh what a cool mag!!" But clearly I was totally wrong. Since 2003 Seventeen has changed  from a girly sophisticated mag appealing to girls just barely in their teens to to a cheap,overated, cliche`, piece of crap!!! I'd like to know what happened!!!!! It's super boring now. It has no style. All the sections are about health garbage & boring global trash. HELLO? What about the stars, movies,.. the music section sucks! Nothing is good anymore! If you disagree with me your probably just as boring as it yourself. I hate it and I DO NOT recomend this magazine. Don't read it!! You'll be wasting your time	neg
Wowzers! ---  --- I am a 26 year old male with skin from the devil. It's so oily that only two minutes out of the shower my nose is already greasy. I have been using Fresh Farmacy 1x or 2x daily for the past two months or so and have been thouroughly impressed. A week ago I bought a bar of Coalface out of curiosity. I had read about it on the LUSH website and was somewhat skeptical. I was told at the store that Fresh Farmacy would be the better bet for my kind of skin, and I figured the slightly higher pricetag on the FF meant that it was better than Coalface. Now, having used Coalface for the past week, I can say for sure that my skin feels cleaner and tighter with Coalface than it generally has with FF. ---  --- I'm not about to toss out my remaining FF of course! It lasts forever and I probably have another 6 or 7 months of it left. I find it to be a great skin cleanser. So far, though, I think Coalface is the better choice for me. ---  --- Give this stuff a try	pos

I was trying to make the shift from a razor blade to an electric shaver and found that this shaver did not provide the close shave I was looking for.  It also was taking me much longer to shave because I had to continually go over the same area in order for it to finally get all the hairs.  In the end, after using it for 5 weeks, I took advantage of the 60 day return policy and returned the shaver.  I am back to my razor blade.  I still hate shaving	neg
I have had a Weber Silver B grill for several years.  I have found that the igniter works for about two years, then just does has to be replaced.  This is an easy replacement, and is not expensive.  This ignighter works as well as any I have seen, and I think the minor cost and inconvenience of replacing the ignighter is offset by the quality of the grill.	pos
I have yet to read a true Grisham thriller, but I plan to in the near future.  Having said that, I have no idea how this compares, but I didn't really care for it.  It's cute and has a sort of slapstick humor that I couldn't get into.  I felt like I was reading a teen or children's book, and I don't like feeling so patronized when I read unless I knowingly pick up a picture book ready for the simplicity of a good message--even then, I don't usually feel patronized or "written down to".  It's simple writing and a simple plot.  It's lighthearted and thus a light read.  I imagine many people would enjoy it; I just couldn't get into it.  :o	neg
Like the Fresh Farmacy, I bought this soap based on the reviews and ended up giving it to a friend at work.  Don't get me wrong, I love most of Lush's products and, to my husbands chagrin, end up spending a lot of money on their online products but when I got this particular soap I just couldn't get into it.  I admit that it smelled a bit better after showering with it for the first time but still found myself reaching for my "Sexy Peel" over this stuff.  I ended up giving it to a friend that I work with but only after it had been passed over my three other girls in my office...I'm just not getting the "heavenly scent" that this item was described as having in previous reviews	neg

size 9.5 fit like it was an 8. I wear a 9 typically and could barely get my foot in, and was unable to walk in them at all without pain. I've bought Steve Madden before many times and know they run slightly small, but this pair was ridiculously small and I suspect perhaps mis-labeled	neg
This is a great and comfortable bra, and it works for me. It's a MINIMIZER, and is great for larger sizes. I exercise a lot and it provides great support, even good enough for running on the treadmill. I have a few of these same bras that have lasted several years. I am so impressed with them that I looked up the tag numbers on the bras and found this site to purchase more, and it is half of what I paid in the mall. Now it is all I wear for everyday :)	pos
This is an awesome little camera.  Except that you can't use it at night!  There are horrible white spots in nighttime photos when the flash is used.  Apparently these appear because the flash is SO close to the lens in this camera, and so dust reflects badly.  It's a known problem [...] ---  --- Also, it's totally annoying that Sony uses all their proprietary technology.  As a result, the cable for connecting this camera to the computer is unwieldly (uhh, have you heard of USB??!!), and you have to buy a sony Memory Stick, which probably won't work with anything else you have.  On the flipside, you can take movies that aren't limited to 30 seconds with this guy - i think that might be a result of the memory stick technology. ---  --- But other than that, the design and operation of this little guy seems pretty slick.  The lens is not one of those that pops out, so not sure if that affects image quality at all, but as far as I could tell, quality was good. ---  --- In the end, what good is a camera that can't take usable pictures with its flash??	neg
This piece of equipment worked really well as far as juicing up the battery when it's dead, and it's really easy to charge and use. Problem is, after I had used it a couple times, the cheapo plastic clamps BOTH SNAPPED. Now they can't grip on the battery terminals. Under warranty, but so expensive to ship (shipping not covered by warranty) that it isn't worth it. Great idea, shoddy construction. ALL VECTOR have these same plastic clamps, so try to find one with metal clamps.	neg
I love this key and cell phone set so much I'm buying another one for a friend.  I looked into the the recall and found that these keys were not part of the recall.

I loved the idea of the electric heating. The "ease" of temperature control, etc... but the heating element melted. The plastic part of it did anyway... right where it conects to the metal bent "rod" that creates the heat to burn the wood chips. ---  --- It also was a pain to constantly snug the wood chips (even tried the chunk type woods) against the heating element. Which ment I had to balance the housing, the water bowl, etc. just to get where the heating element was at. ---  --- I don't know about other electric smokers, but this on "stank". ---  --- Just get one with a smoker box on the side... toss in some coals, wood... whatever... as needed. Don't try to make the unit too "scientific"	neg
I'm going to be completely honest with you. I hated the HP camera's because 1. does not take great pictures at night 2. digital zoom is not great either 3. blur's out if you do not stand still taking the picture. I've had an old HP camera and I have had this newer HP camera and they are all the same. It doesnt seem like it really matters what MP they are. Still bur's out and it is disappointing. I guess it really depends on the person about this camera but I'd rather have a Sony, Samsung, or some other company's item. =	neg
DO NOT buy the case Canon sells for this camera. It takes 20 seconds to take the camera out or put it in	neg
This is what I use when I want to knit something for myself.  The patterns are hip and young and they always feature the latest greatest designers.  This is also much more about fashion than any other knitting magazine out there- lots of runway pictures and rail-thin models posing knitwear in exotic locations.  I find that each issue has a good mix of projects of varying skill levels.  I have knitted several and I'm happy with the instructions and I've never run across any major pattern mistakes.  I find that the exact yarns, however, can be hard to find.  They usually give you enough information about the yarn and desired effect so that you can easily substitute.  While I'm careful not to pick patterns that won't be embarrasing to wear next year, they do have a lot of hyper-trendy patterns.  It would be a pity to waste all that time and money on something that would be decidedly "out" by the time you finsih it.  	pos

This product gives your hair great volume without looking greasy.(Be careful not to use too much!) It works best if you have a little time to diffuse your hair with a blow dryer! Not surprisingly, when I use curl conscious many people will compliment the curls and the depth it adds to my hair :)I wish it would combat frizz a little more, but my hair is less frizzy when I use it. I guess the next thing I'll try is the Bumble and Bumble Frizz Fighter	pos

As gifted a story teller as he is a veterinarian, James Herriot has the rare ability to bring out every emotion known to the human race with a single magical flick of his pen. Every Living Thing is without a doubt one of the crowning achievements of a master, and is possessed by a single, true trait that is difficult to find in many commercial books- every single tale is told straight from the heart. You will never fail to laugh at the hilarious tales and cry at the most poignant moments. If you're an animal lover, or even just have a passing interest in animals, this is a book you will hold on to and re-read until the end of your days. Kudos, James Herriot, you are very much missed	pos

This is one heavy duty cast iron pot! Very heavyweight. The lid holds a good seal to the pot. My only wish is that it came preseasoned. I sure made a smoke filled room occur. And of course, once was not enough to season, so I had to do it again. But overall, great pot	pos
I love this old documentary...Capt Clark Gable does an excellent job narrating it, the color footage is a rare treat, and it gives an excellent insight into the day-to-day lives of those from the greatest generation.  It is a real tribute to all the men who flew bombers in WWII and we need to remember their service and sacrifices.  They fought a tougher war and sustained much greater losses than we have in Iraq or Afghanistan, plus they were gone for much longer periods and didn't have the technology such as email or video teleconferencing to keep in touch with their loved ones.  We need to remember them, as we are losing them quickly and soon they may all be gone.  But their legacy remains, and it is films like this one that preserves it	pos

Don't waste your money.  This album is cheesy, sounds like a million other pop rock songs, and is nothing compared to their earlier work.

This is a quality sweatshirt that I am enjoying wearing during the cold winter weather. I have had trouble, in the past , with other brands with the arms being too short or the body length being too short but that is not the case with this product . The only problem with the product is that it could stand to have more elastic at the bottom but this is a minor problem . The service was excellent and I will return for more BEARS gear	pos
I have purchased both the Home & Gardens interior and the Punch interior software. Home & Gardens is much easier to use. You can really start without reading much of the manual. Punch demands that you read the manual (342 pages). It is not intuative. But Punch can do so much more and has so much more creativity. IE: Punch has a library of trees, shrubs and flowers for your yard. Home & Gardens only have potted plants, nothing you can use to landscape. Punch also allows you to make custom doors or windows to your exact specifications. H&G doesn't. You have to choose a set style of door or window and change options.I also could place digital photos of my backyard behind my "house" on Punch to make it more realisitic. I like both software programs, but Punch has more options, but you have to do your homework first	pos
This product was terrible.  First and foremost this seat did NOT fit on American Airlines Business Class seats!  Secondly, the rear facing car seat tilts so far forward that your baby is falling forward agains the harness and if they fall asleep their face is pressing against the seat belt.  The wheel covers fell off the first time I used it.  The stroller is a piece of junk.  When I called the company to explain my problems they never even called me back, so on top of it all they have a horrible product and terribel customer service to match.  Do not buy	neg
Its the best table out there. I did a lot of research and now have a year of "testing." We bought it for my daughter when she was 1, and she's almost 3. I also run a daycare. The chairs don't tip and various ages from 2-5 have put them to their worst. It cleans easily and is easy to put aside, if needed. I did have to replace a chair once (I stood on it.) and the customer service was fast and friendly.	pos
We LoVe this game. We were first introduced to it at our children's preschool where it fast became a favorite at "free choice time". The children engaged in it delightfully and playfully. Everyone has fun. The game board is durable and can be constructed differently over and over again -- this works out so great because with all the repeated play ours gets the kids are not memorizing the spot the item was. I worried a little that it might be too competitive and those that were "better" at it might leave those not as quick at hunting feeling discouraged, BUT have not ever found that to be the case when we have the game out at home or at the school. The board is brightly colored the items are fascinatingly fun to search for. It is a challenge even for us BIG kids. I would recommend it highly for a fun family activity game	pos

I can't believe that other reviewers are calling the moves in this video "easy to master".  I found some of them to be nearly impossible to follow.  The camara barely focuses on her feet as she perfoms intricate latin dance footwork!  I am an athletic twenty-three year old girl who is not a slow learner.  I just excercised with this DVD for the first time and it was really tough!  I didn't get a work out at all because I was scratching my head and rewinding the thing so much.  She doesn't break down the moves at all and it's just so much more confusing than it needs to be.  The dances are cute, but it's frustrating that she doesn't explain the moves.  I hope no one else has to waste their money on this stupid thing	neg
It was an excellent purchase. Fast ans efficient receipt of goods and fine quality	pos
This is the third DVD from Shawn Trautman that I have gotten (Swing and Cha-Cha are the others), and they are all exceedingly well done.  They start from ground zero and progress in very small steps that are a snap to follow.  By the time it's over, you will understand the logic behind the dance and know enough to do well on a social dance floor.  It will also get you pumped to learned more advanced steps; you won't feel intimidated.  I highly recommend it	pos

This was sent to my daughter and son-in-law as a thank you present for a recent visit. I had noticed numerous bottles on the floor of their shower and thought it would be a great way to neaten it up.  They love it!!!

This is a well engineered product; I cannot call it a toy because it is much much more than that. After building just one of the sample setups I was able to put down the manual and start creatively designing and building my own. My daughter (3.5 years old) loves it. She really likes placing a marble on the run when I tell her its time to "test it", and I let her identify the error. The only marbles that have fallen off the track are due to construction errors by myself. After 1 day (and several of our own setups) we already find ourselves wanting more pieces. I suggest buying the largest set from the get go if you have an engineering type mind or just enjoy puzzles. Nice feature to note : the coloring of the blocks is logical; each color has its own unique function(s).	pos
I experienced what seemed to be a common problem for many people that have purchased av cables for the ipod.

I am a first time expectant mother and like most excited moms-to-be, I read pretty much all of the reviews on every item I need to register for or buy for baby. However, the helpful hint I have to give comes from my other half who already has a son and has used a wipe warmer. He said the wipe warmers that heat from the bottom up (heat ALL of the wipes) are a waste of money because by the time you get to the bottom wipes....they are dried out from being continuously reheated. They basically lose their moisture which defeats the purpose of a wipe in the first place and you end up throwing a bunch of them out without the benefit of using them first. We opted to go with this one because it seems to be smaller (more convenient for travel which we will do a fair amount of) and it heats just the first few wipes which is usually all you need for a diaper change. Some mothers would say this is not really a necessary thing to have (after all, babies lived through diaper use just fine before these things were invented), but because our baby will be born during the winter, I thought this would have more use for us. I gave this product four stars because we haven't tried it yet....but just wanted to pass that helpful hint along to other mothers who are interested in practicality and saving money and hopefully not losing quality in the process	pos
I liked this tub at first.  The size was nice, and the sling was comfortable and good support for my preemie newborn.  After about a month of use, though, there was a horrible odor emitting from the mesh sling.  This was after "squeezing" it out as best I could and propping it up to dry after every use.  The sling is not machine washable and therefore unusable after it gets ruined by mold.  --- I stopped using the sprayer after the first couple days.  It was just too much of a pain to fill it up everytime, especially since it doesn't even spray well.  The other reviewers are correct in saying that the button on the sprayer is difficult to press.  Especially when your hands are wet and slippery. --- It's a good thing BRU will take back anything!  I am off to return it and purchase the old faithful cheapie tub	neg
I'm not usually a ballet person.  I haven't seen anything since "The Nutcracker" when I was six.  But this was absolutely brilliant.  The concept for it is completely bold and original and Adam Cooper as The Swan blew me away.  How can you beat a dancer in black leather pants with a riding crop?  Tchaikovsky never would have envisioned this, but he would be utterly thrilled to see what they have done with his epic ballet. 	pos

However, boiled down to the essentials, she had a charismatic, photogenic face, BUT SHE NEVER DEPENDED ON PROMOTING HERSELF: MGM and fellow artists and critics sang their rhapsodies and privately I suspect she overdosed quickly of the SuperStar-label and became bored with the whole idea. I think she felt she was overpraised much too early in her career and felt embarassed by the never-ending attention.  ---  --- In Queen Christina she is beautifully lit and photographed(and from 1927 on - she was filmed behind closed curtains...with only William Daniels and Karl Freund close at hand)... ---  --- I would say that many an actress with that attention could have easily have filled her shoes. She was a timid actress. Cukor once observed that he felt she had to be thrown into the action - she never created. Seeing her with Constance Bennett in TWO-FACED WOMAN og Charles Boyer in CONQUEST, you`ll see that she can`t reach their standard in  scenes she is forced to act and interplay - and not merely pose and being brilliantly photographed in close-up. ---  --- In QUEEN CHRISTINA she is a MOVIESTAR, not an actress...  ---  --- So who would I define the ultimate star of the 20th century? ELIZABETH TAYLOR; for all her brilliant performances(and bad 1s), her legendary life and beauty...  Now, Miss Taylor is what A MOVIESTAR AND A GREAT MOVIEACTRESS is all about..	pos

  The Panasonic PV-GS500 was discontinued in late 2006 in anticipation of Panasonic's new 2007 models which will be available in the Spring. ---  ---   The PV-GS500 is compact, delivers stunning video in moderate lighting and above, has a lot of features that will appeal to the aspiring pro-sumer videographer. It lacks an audio output jack, which many will fault it for. It does have a separate microphone jack. The menu is driven by a toggle and is easy to use. ---  ---   It is reall aimed at the casual videographer who wants superb quality in a compact, uncomplicated package and it delivers precisely that. ---  ---   Low-light performance is poor, but there is an accessory shoe, so you can mount an auxillary light. I would suggest getting an accessory bracket that provides two or three accessory shoes so you can use both a shotgun microphone and an auxillary light for weddings, parties and other group events. ---  ---   Battery life is about what you would expect, so carrying one or two spare batteries is recommended. ---  ---   All in all, a very nice 3CCD camcorder for the advanced amateur or just someone who wants superb image quality in an easy-to-use package. ---  --- Jerr	pos

I like this printer.  There a few minor quarks, but it's fast and the prints come out good.  The one thing to watch for is making sure the ink tape cartridge stays tight.  If it's lose it will start making bad prints.  It takes less than minute to pull the cartridge out, tighten it and start printing again. ---  --- I am also using this with the Mac OSX OS.  Though the device says it will only work with PC and mentions something about the CASIO CW Utility for use on a Mac, but no where on the Casio site could I find the mentioned Utility.    After some searching I cam e accross this: ---  --- [...] ---  --- This allows the CW-100 to work fine on a Mac.  Though I have never seen the  PC software that comes with printer, I have read that this mac version does not have all of the text formating options. This is enough to get around, since you can make a JPG version of your label, put that in the print area and print away.  The JPG can be what ever image/text you want.  Resolution is great too.  I print at 300dpi. ---  --- All in all, I found this to be a great purchase.  I make music and do not have the money to send out to have my CDs done.  This print has more than paid for itself by allowing me to make professional looking cds and very little cost.  Great the DIYer	pos
Highly recommed this grill cover.  The appearance/style is classy with it's subtle colors that work well on the backyard patio.  And it is SOOO durable!  I'm sure it will last for years.

This printer has been a piece of garbage since the day I bought it. I don't know why I kept trying, as the purchase was made about a year ago. It should have been thrown it in the trash long ago and I would have cut my losses (instead I did buy one more package of paper and ink. Mistake.) I have never gotten more than one picture in a row without an error message, turning the printer off, turning it back on, doing that several times, and finally maybe getting it to print two pictures in the same day.  ---  --- Now it says the cartridge should be replaced, when about 20 minutes earlier it told me there were approximately 56 pictures left in the cartridge (and I have not printed anywhere near 44 pictures, which would add up to the claim of 100 per cartridge. I have printed about 6.)  ---  --- The ironic thing is, the handful of pictures that have printed correctly have been beautiful. The one that I printed today was perfect. But several tries to print one more picture were a waste of about two hours. This is the last time I try to use the printer, it is finally going in the trash	neg

This game is tons of fun!  My husband, children (ages 6 and 7) and I have had hours and hours of enjoyment from this game.  I definetely recommend that your children be able to read fluently to thoroughly enjoy the game.  This game is also great for informal parties, as an ice breaker. 	pos

when i first got this mp3 and opened up the box i was surprised how small it is.  about the size of a piece of chewing gum.  i installed the program via the included cd and it worked right away with no problem what so ever.  this held all the music i had on my lap top with lots of room to spare.  the program is easy to use and downloading music to the player is fast and easy.  the sound is outstanding with the ear-bud headphones that are included.  the fm works well and the display is back-light and very easy to read. all of the players options are user friendly and do not require a lot of skill to use.  this is one piece of electronics that will not drive you mad with hard to use software or directions.  as an added bonus they included batteries.  this is one of my favorite gadgets and i would recommend the 1 gig for any user.  it is not expensive at all and really who needs more music than this holds	pos
I was so excited to receive my first issue of Art In America, and I was severly disappointed to see that it is mostly full-page ads for galleries in Europe.

Not sure what all the fuss is regarding assembly.  I just unpacked and assembled it a few minutes ago with no trouble.  Assemble is probably too strong a word, there is no actual assembly or tools involved.  As for the weight, maybe 15 pounds, certainly nowhere near 50.   ---  --- The instructions seemed sufficient although I didn't really need to use them.    ---  --- Basically, if the fear of difficult assembly reported here is your only concern, don't let that stand in the way of choosing this item.   --- 	pos
This is Ann Waldron's best McLeod Dulaney mystery yet. The characters are so lively and well-drawn they literally walk right off the page (and, in some cases, right into your heart).

There are buttered-up popcorn movies that entertain you, score a ticket to "Jurassic Park" and Spielberg for that, and there are films with gravitas, that move you, disturb you, drag you to the altar kicking and screaming, to consider circumstances you might not brave yourself.."Badlands," Terrence Malick's 1973 directorial debut, an overlooked jewel of a film, forcibly moves you, and takes an unsavory subject, the Charles Starkweather serial killings' crime spree, up in the vacated Badlands of South Dakota, and refines it til you posit, "How did we get here as a country? What went wrong?"..And then you appraise the challenges a film-maker overcomes to project the psychopathic wrath of two teenagers (Martin Sheen as Kit Carruthers, Sissy Spacek as Holly Sargis) on a thrill-killing "honeymoon", onto the silver screen and make it empathetic, palatable..Why would anyone care in the first place about two low-life, lost highway delinquents, who shoot a parent, assume they can get away consequence-free, and move on with their careless lives like nothing more infractious than cutting an afternoon civics class has occurred?..However, "Badlands" is rooted in unfortunate fact, these inexplicable events happened to a pedestrian populace in North America, and Malick lets you tag along in this teenage angst riddled odyssey, deeper and deadlier into an American wasteland..The film is palpable evil genuis, arguably a top ten American film classic, irrespective it was shot by a first time director, with an unknown cast.."Badlands" resonates with gritty authenticity, cinematic style, fierce inhumanity, and the most haunting musical score (Erik Satie's Gymnopedies 3) that underwrites a Sissy Spacek voice over narration, spoken in a lazy monotone like a detached schoolgirl explaining away her unexcused absence in the principal's office, when in fact Holly (Sissy Spacek) is the fractured other half of the Kit Carruthers' killing machine, a bossom buddy in crime..Some films are purposefully pure entertainment, escapist faire.."Badlands" on the other hand is rare art, belongs in a museum	pos
I used to love this magazine.  It still has some excellent articles, but it is true that there are way too many filler issues now with top 100 lists of things I have no interest in (resort hotels, spas, expensive travel agents).  However, on the flip side, it never talks down to the reader - the audience is assumed to be well travelled and somewhat sophisticated - which I appreciate.  I checked out Nat Geographic Traveller hoping it would be like the CN Traveller of old, but although it has nicer photography (with few gratuitously scantily clad female shots), it seemed much more mainstream - like I had already done many of the "dream trips" befor I hit my 30s and the information also seemed much shallower.  I like Geo, but I struggle through the French and it's a lot more expensive	pos
The is one of the fastest and easiest to learn games I have ever played.  The first time we played was on Christmas Day.

The program works fine on Windows XP and is easy to use. It lets you print cards of many sizes. The big disappointment is in the number of cards that comes with the program. The back of the box claims "4500+ Cards and Sentiments, Celebrate life's special moments with cards for all occasions". That's nice. The problem with that is that I counted the total number of cards that come with the program.  It only adds up to 1045! So where are the other 3450+ cards and sentiments? Are you supposed to design them yourself? I just don't know. And certainly "cards for all occasions" means just that, doesn't it?  Well there's lots of birthday cards and plenty of holiday cards but not one sympathy card of any kind. I guess you just need to buy those on your own	neg
I was expecting to see a decent film by Bava, but after having seen about 5 of his films, I can only guess that is he is a very good stylist but he lacks the capability to engage us with a story or to even scare us. Most of his films are gorgeous to behold but they are vapid and have no story, this film is just like all the rest.  ---  --- There is no point to any of it, there is no plot and hardly any suspense, suffice it to say it might be interesting for a 12 year old horror goof but to an adult, its quite tedious. Chris Lee is rather banal also, he doesn't do much and it seems that he dubbed his own voice in the studio, most of the cast is rather dull also, supposedly playing some ancient noble family, they look more like 1960's mop heads and morons who were on too much acid. The dialogue, what there is, is crude, probably written by a drunk Italian because there are so many mistakes, one example was when Lee was whipping the lady on the beach and she says, "I can't have more ice cream!"  ---  --- So, I would suggest renting "Planet of the Vampires" because that is more enjoyable than this waste. Interesting character to note was "Lesmo", dubbed as the "European Peter Lorre" who doesn't have much in the way of presence or acting skills and he looks like a cross between a frog and a midget.  --- 	neg
This 10-20mm lens is equivalent to a 15-30mm in a 35mm film camera, so it's an ultra-wide lens at 10mm. I was pleasantly surprised at how sharp the images are from this lens; and it's rectilinear, which means that straight lines in real life remain straight in the photograph. It is a well-made lens, made with high-grade materials. What this lens excels at is when you want to photograph sweeping landscapes, close-quarters interior photography, and in architectural photography where you don't mind the exaggerated converging lines that an ultrawide produces. Personally, that's what I like, so I'm very happy with this Sigma 10-20mm	pos

American Heritage is a fine magazine brought to us by the same publishers who bring us Forbes Magazine. It is a magazine that examines history in all shapes and forms, examining past events and cultural changes that have shaped the American nation.  ---  --- One thing about this magazine that you will notice right away is that it is not just a magazine about American political history or the type of history that you remember from your school days. It does talk about this type of history, but it also includes stories about music, art, and other topics, breaking them apart and explaining how and why things happened the way they did and how they compare to the present. It also points out facts from the past that are more obscure, making for some very stimulating reading.  ---  --- Current events are also covered in this magazine, and in these instances, American Heritage discusses present- day phenomena from an intellectual and critical standpoint, often comparing it to similar events in the American past. This helps to keep the magazine current and more in- tune with important issues of the day.   ---  --- History buffs will love this magazine, and so will those of an intellectual persuasion. The articles here are more thoughtful than other magazines and many of them require greater concentration. For these reasons, American Heritage is not really a casual reading type of publication. It is intended for those who like to read, think, discuss, and debate. It's one of my favorite magazines of its kind on the market today.  --- 	pos
I unfortunately wound up seeing this Christmas Misgiving on its original airing.  I have always been a fan of any Christmas special since Rudolph hit the air way back when. Each holiday season I hope for something to come along that has the potential to become the "New Rudolph".  This is so far away from that you would need the Hubble Space scope in order to see how close it came.  The imaging is excellent and has been executed with great expertise. Regrettably the story makes Santa vs. the Martins look like an Oscar contender.  Such a waste trying to make it more desirable by hoking it up with 3D gimmickry.  You can't improve on failure. After it aired on TV I didn't see it return in later years on regular TV. I didn't miss it then and was hoping to extend the pleasure indefinitely.  Can't win them all	neg

We recently bought the same model dispenser, but in the satin finish.  From the first, only two of the three chambers were usable because the pumps didn't work (yes, we followed the instructions carefully).  Two months later, another pump has given out so only one chamber is usable.  Instead of this loser, try "The Dispenser 71450 Classic IV." We had one of these for years with never a problem and replaced it only because it was beginning to show its age.

As soon as I bought it I realized it doesn't hold the phone too well. Few days later my concerns proved them selves, every time I made a rapid movement or tried to run with it (even very carefully) the phone would unclamp itself from the holster and slam into the ground. Every time I was lucky to realize as soon as I droped it, untill today when after coming home from shoping I realized my z520a is no longer with me. There goes a $200 phone, lost because of a stupid $10 holster.  Do not buy this product, if you realy need a holster go with something like Sonyericsson's "ICE-26" that secures the phone with an extra flap on top so it dosn't slip out of the holster. As for me I gatta get me a new phone, shame I had the Z520 cell phone for about 4 months now and I really liked it	neg
This was the best therapy game ever.  My girls bought it for me, a gift because I love board games.  We mostly played it with their friends.   I have played with my children several times and found out some very interesting views that they have about me.  I decided to bring it to a family gathering.  I have always been distant with my eight siblings.  The game started out with the kids and my sisters ect.  then when they saw I was ok with laughing at myself they asked the children to leave and just the sisters played.  We had a total awakening of how we see each other.  We have never been closer, since that game our communication has been wonderful.  This game is the best.  We laughed so hard we ached the next day.  We played till 2:00 a.m.  Our husbands kept calling us asking when we were going be home.  We started our game at 9:00 p.m. and told them we'd just be an hour or two. LOL  I have been instructed to bring the game to this Summers get-together	pos
Ethan Mordden's editors have allowed him to ruin what could possibly have been a good book.  This is the worst of his books on the various decades of the Broadway musical as the faults of the seventies book have widened into gulfs.  His political ramblings (often just slightly right of Ann Coulter and making as much sense) seep through the book, dragging it down.  The French people are slammed a number of times, along with the ACLU, Burt Lancaster (apparently, according to Ethan a good friend of Stalin) and the left in general, while the author defends Bush (and it does take some looking back over the page to figure out how he fits all this into a book on musical theatre).  The author's train of thought wanders like a bitter old man  all over the page in search of a target, any target.  It is often hard to stomach.  The truly sad fact about this is that the author often has quite cogent things to say about a particular musical and when he does stick to that, it can actually make one want to look at the work again.  An editor should have cleaned the work up before before allowing it on stage to greet its public.  The author is capable of better work	neg

His fragmentary thoughts are difficult to follow. There is some wisdom here and there, but not worth the headache you'll get trying to decipher what is going on in his head. Here is an example: --- "If you say your own name to yourself at such a moment, it will seem utterly alien. You will then understand the sacrament of baptism." Huh? ---  --- At first, I thought his writing may just be over my head, but after re-reading most of it, I realized it was just bad. It's like the whole book was written when he was high or something. Some very good ideas, but most can be found in other, better written books.	neg
The mid-size is actually quite large.  Had I to do it over again, I would just get the original size because that would be sufficient.  I like a bit of sun but just not in my eyes!  I found that when wearing it in a boat with the wind at my face as we traveled, it stayed on very well.  That was a concern that I had since many visors flip off in heavy wind currents.  I did get a slight headache from it but not as bad as other visors.  The visor part seems to be a hard plastic with a light cloth material covering.  I chose purple and it is a beautiful shade.  The bows that go around your head are made of some soft comfortable material and they go farther around your head than other standard visors. 	neg
Having been a fan of Antonia Fraser for many years, I highly anticipated her biography of Queen Marie-Antoinette, but have been very disappointed in that she often chooses the sensational over the factual. She depicts Marie-Antoinette's mother Empress Maria Theresa as heartless and calculating for sending her daughter to France at age 14 to get married, but arranged marriages were the norm; the empress was not doing anything out of the ordinary. What startled me most is that Fraser not only insists on Antoinette having an affair with Count Axel von Fersen, of which there is little concrete evidence, but goes onto maintain that Axel used condoms to keep the queen from getting pregnant. It seems to me that Marie-Antoinette loved children so much; she came from a family of sixteen where children were valued and her more liberal sister Caroline went on to have eleven children or more. She was also a devout Catholic and using such devices were unthinkable, unless one was a prostitute or dealing with prostitutes. In this case Fraser is applying the morals of some British aristocratic ladies to a queen of France. If Marie-Antoinette had been caught in adultery, it would have been considered treason; she would have been sent to a convent and had her children taken away from her. With all of her enemies at Court, that was not a risk she would have taken, if she had been so inclined. On a smaller scale, Fraser makes ridiculous assertions about Marie-Antoinette dyeing her hair - in all the pictures that I have seen of her, her hair looks grey from either powder or premature age; I have never read any first hand accounts of her dyeing it. Not that that is a big deal; but it makes me wonder where Lady Fraser's life ends and where Marie-Antoinette's life begins. I found it offensive that at the end Fraser interprets Marie-Antoinette's death as some kind of sacrifice for the cause of democracy, when she believed in monarchy and wanted her little son to be king. Especially, since Marie-Antoinette's murder was followed not by democracy but by dictatorships and Napoleon crowning himslf emperor. Sadly, there is a lacuna of decent biographies of the queen in the English language. One can only hope that the works of Bertieres, Chalon, and Delorme will soon be translated and published in English. Fraser's book does have some interesting details (aside from those which flow from her imagination) and it is much more sympathetic to the queen than Lever's travesty	neg
This magazine is ideal reading for anyone who demands a broad perspective and deep analysis about any current topics related to international foreign policy. Years ago, I subscribed to the magazine and now, as an International Relations grad student, I use articles in The National Interest to address my areas of concentration. The pieces are useful to me because they are so in-depth. I appreciate the pragmatic approach of the writers as well as the wealth of information the editors ensure are featured in each issue. I particularly like the Reporter-at-Large feature and the recent "Conversation with Henry Kissinger" segment.  ---  --- Top-level experts on foreign policy like diplomats and intelligence officers, well-known policy-makers, and prestigious journalists make The National Interest an exciting read. The broad and varied views enhance my studies. I like the magazine because the centrist perspectives distinguish this magazine from the many others I read like The Economist, Foreign Affairs and Foreign Policy. I find that every article offers level-headed reasoning; no sound bites, no bumper-sticker clichï¿½s. The articles offer conclusions that allow me to develop my own informed opinions.  ---  --- For anyone who wants to be up to date about foreign policy, and who wants to develop well-documented opinions from those who have been on the "front lines" of world affairs, this is the magazine I recommend without reservation. ---  --- 2nd year Graduate Student at the Yale University, McMillan Center of International Studies.	pos
This isn't your typical run through game, you actually have to think and take risk at times. It does get a little difficult as stated in alot of reviews but that's the thing I like most about it. I rate this just as good as Jedi Academy. My only flaws were the default controls, those were a pain. I highly recommend changing that and the force powers were a pain to use at first but once you got used to it it wasn't that bad. This has a decent story line as all the Star Wars games do and fun to play. I had to use a few cheat codes on some of the levels (like Level Skip)because it gets pretty tough, but I didn't have to do that much, maybe twice. Anyways, this is a definately must have for all the Star Wars fans out there.	pos
If you like math, I guarantee you'll like this book! The author starts out with some very nice infinite sums from 17th and 18th century mathematics (Newton, Leibniz, the Bernoullis, and Euler's Gamma function). He continues into the 19th century with Riemann and Lebesque integrals, Weierstrass' pathological functions, Cantor's set theory, and winds up with Baire's category theorem. ---  --- Reading this book is like taking a guided tour through Real Analysis (= calculus of one real variable) with the math prof you always wished you had. Its only prerequisite is a working knowledge of calculus; the main points are explained very clearly, so the reader can skip through the book or fill in the details, and will learn a lot, either way. The book is very well written, and a great pleasure to read; I highly recommend it, for students, fans, and teachers	pos
In 1973, director Nicholas Roeg took a Daphne Du Maurier story about a strained family situation, added a child in a red coat and some superlative direction, cast wonderful, talented actors such as Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie, and produced a seminal and classic piece of seventies horror, the unmissable "Don't Look Now". ---  --- Six years later, Cronenberg - obviously, oh so obviously having been influenced by the starkly pared-down imagery and understated elegance of the Roeg picture - decided to put his own markedly different spin on a terribly similar theme, with disasterously boring results. ---  --- To synopsise the plot: Frank Carveth's estranged wife is crazy, and undergoing unconventional therapy at her psychiatrist's controversial institute. Suspecting her of abusing their daughter, he removes her from his wife's care, to the strenuous objections of her shrink. Several people connected to wifey's emotionally crippling past begin to show up dead, and Carveth finds himself fighting to save his daughter from her crazy mother's 'other' set of kids. ---  --- So it's David Cronenberg. So what? ---  --- Performances and direction, as well as screenplay, are all simply mundane. There's barely a shred of the sleek, polished talent we have come to recognise as David Cronenberg, and what we have instead is a sort of mishmash of some of the better aspects from classic American horror movies, as seen through the obviously tired eyes of the writer/director. It's almost got the sense of isolation of 'The Shining', but there are too many incidental characters. It's almost got the same sense of murder-by-numbers as 'Hallowe'en', but lacks the decisive action of that movie. It's close to the stark imagery and sense of motherhood-gone-awry as 'Carrie' (and even the lead actress bears a striking resemblance to Piper Laurie!), but Samantha Eggar's performance is too overblown.  ---  --- Makeup effects, too, are over-ambitious for the time and fail to create any sense of impact or drama, in that they just look silly. Of course, you could say the same for 'The Exorcist', nowadays, but where that film still has the incredible strength of Ellen Burstyn's and Linda Blair's performances, all 'The Brood' has to go on is some deformed alien-figures that hiss a lot. It's not good. ---  --- In short, where a movie matters most, 'The Brood' fails wholly to deliver, instead regaling us with 90 or so minutes of unfulfilling cinema. ---  --- A note on the subtext: It's difficult to feel any sort of respect for the social commentary contained herein. Sure, topics like the state of the Nuclear Family and the negative effects of a Mother's love are riveting things, when handled properly. Unfortunately, when the package and presentation are so obviously hollow and overdone, who could care less about subtext? ---  --- I couldn't.	neg

I bought this model in order to be rid of my almost-new Sony MHCEC70 with its faulty ergonomics and detestable tuner.  Having once owned an earlier PM-series model, this new Panasonic was the obvious choice and it does not disappoint.  Like its predecessor, the PM53 is a nice, powerful compact stereo with (for the money) ridiculously nice audio quality and a good tuner, especially on the FM band.  It can easily be turned up load enough to cause hearing damage and annoy neighbors in adjacent houses.  The remote covers every function and is easy enough to figure out without consulting the manual.   ---  --- Right now, this is the budget stereo of choice for the discerning.  Sony's competing models are cheesy-looking (hog attention on store shelves,) bigger (i.e., take more materials/cost more to ship,) and consequently suffer certain cost-cutting measures like the aforementioned crappy tuner and simplified (and of course, proprietary) antenna connector.  It's like choosing between the Pontiac and the Toyota.  The Sony is for the unwashed rubes who want 300 watts of mylar-coated bling.  The Panasonic is for people who want something that makes pleasant sounds and looks like the rest of the furniture. 	pos

I rec'd this today.  I had been looking for a while for a white faced stainless watch and kept coming back to this one from Bulova. (I looked for nearly two years!)  I did some looking around online and in stores and Amazon by far had the best price (they beat everyone by at least $100), so I did what any girl would do, I bought it.   ---  --- It is a substantial watch. It's not a watch for someone looking for something dainty or unassuming. I don't think it's heavy, it just feels like you've got a watch on.  I personally like the size and weight.  I plan on this being my spring/summer watch until it dies or something happens to it.  I have a Seiko Coutura with a black MOP face w/diamonds that I love, but I wanted something different but sort of the same and this one was it. 	pos

 --- GOLF DIGEST is the big daddy of a well-populated family of golf publications. It's self-styled tag line--'The #1 Golf Publication'--is well-earned. ---  --- Where other weeklies report the golfing *news*, GOLF DIGEST is a monthly celebration of golf as life, or at least of the golfing life. It's golf-star-celebrity-packed articles tend to wear titles in the imperative ('Don't Stretch Your Wedges'), giving the sense that the golf world is populated by feverish self-improvers. ---  --- Even those of us who are less than bent on links glory, the photography of this publication looks extraordinary. This aspect reaches its zenith during the magazine's frequent published admirations of the finer courses around the world. ---  --- No doubt about it, GOLF DIGEST is a lifestyle magazine as much as anything else. Yet the semi- to really-serious golfer will find its pages rich with suggestions on improving his or her game. ---  --- GOLF DIGEST anchors the world of English-language golfing publications. Even better, you can frequently pick it up for the price of a few frequent flyer miles	pos

I sincerely hope iPods have improved... I bought a 30G iPod Photo a little over a year ago and was on my second replacement when just recently, outside the warranty (which of course goes from original purchase date, not replacement date), it's kaput again. Now if I have to pay $275 for Apple to fix or replace a three month old player! No way. THREE players on the blink, each after a few months - that isn't just bad luck.  ---  --- That isn't even mentioning the difficulties with the iTunes software or if you change computers. I get a new PC and have to re-transfer 100s of CDs! How lame. That negates all the convenience of the large capacity (I wish other MP3 players had the storage space the iPods have).  ---  --- I just can't justify spending more money to replace this limited, inferior POS again. So essentially over the last year I have spent about $1 a day to have a player and now I'm left with nothing. I will be buying a different player. I will spend far less than $275 and get something that will last more than three months, is compatible with the rest of the players in the world and is easy and convenient to load and use - obviously not an iPod! Unfortunately I can't transfer the music I spend hours and hours loading up (over and over). What a waste of money and time	neg

Where to begin?  Cliched. Pretentious. Flat. Static. Maudlin. Melodramatic. Homophobic. And finally, just plain BORING.  Start with an over-the-top caricature of a deaf-mute Patsy Cline young drag queen arriving the big city, pile on cardboard "colorful" characters like typical AIDS patient, porno star, and loud-mouthed Latina hot mamna, and whaddya get?  An amateur film populated with some of the most UNLIKABLE, UNATTRACTIVE characters ever, all spewing some of the unbelievably BAD dialogue ever written - and to think the (formerly talented) director made THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD also with D'Onofrio? Go figure.  Nice cover art, though	neg

While I'm driving, this thing doesn't work at all. There's tons of static and the music cuts out all the time. The only time this FM transmitter works is when my car is still.

Photos were excellent. But photo print quality depends very much on the print shop. For the same photo file, it can look like a 4M photo when taken to a below quality printer shop. Photos taken indoor with marginal lighting (no flash used) turned out to be yellowish. Battery life is very long despite its large 3" LCD. Battery charging time is over 3 hours - too long. Photos files viewed on computer looks just great. 8'x10' prints are great but have not tried larger prints. Touch screeen control is a delight and very easy to choose and set. Date on photo is red (would be better if it is black). And the location of the date is not at the far right hand corner	pos
Although this sports new remastering, unless you have either the Golden Hits CD available here at Amazon and your local CD shop, the now out of print Golden Celebration boxed set or the 2 volume "Patti Page Collection" series (Volume 2 is also out of print), this is unnecessary as it duplicates every track on Golden Hits except for Let Me Go Lover instead of With My Eyes Wide Open I'm Dreaming and the songs are arranged in a different order.  Fans are better off looking for the 2 previous out of print collections with Let Me Go Lover to obtain this track and for the rest of this stuff, either buy Golden Hits, the boxed set and the 2 volume Patti Page Collection series, and BTW, Vol. 1 is still in print so you can order it right here at Amazon	pos

We bought this - on cassette - in Washington DC on our first day of honeymoon in September 1997. Having flown from Northern Ireland, it provided us with the perfect honeymoon soundtrack as we drove from  Washington to Nashville, along the Skyline drive, down through South West  Virginia, across Eastern Kentucky to Berea, and down to Smoky Mountains  National Park in Tennessee. We are from an Ulster-Scots/Scotch-Irish  background, and during those three weeks we fell in love with the land that  our forebears had settled in so many centuries before, bringing thier  fiddles and folk songs with them, creating what was the core of mountain  old-time music and bluegrass. From the Carter Family right through, every  song is a classic. You must buy this	pos

I purchased this card game as a spur of the moment christmas gift for my son who loves monopoly but can get no one to play the board game because of how long the board game version takes. My son as well as the rest of the family was wonderfully surprised to find this monopoly card game addictive and fun to play.  Each of the hands goes quickly and the goal of $10000 is very attainable to reach in a fairly short period of time. I will have to admit 3 people was a bit more challenging and fun than just 2 and we decided it would be easier to keep score of the money by using pencil, paper, and a calculator. Overall, I highly recommend this version	pos
This camera took some great pictures, and I enjoyed it's size and functionality for several months.

nice stand, paint has faded a bit after a year being stored outside exposed to the elements, but isn't peeling or exposing any metal.  There are 3 segments, they all fit together easily and are reinforced to prevent breakage or bending, but they're freely attached.  So if you need to move your hammock stand you'll need 2 people unless you push it, if you pull it, one of the angled arms will slide out of the horizontal bar.  You could probably fix this yourself by drilling a hole through the bottom (horizontal) bar and into one of the arms to screw in a bolt, but the steel is very thick, about 3/16" or 1/4" thick	pos
We have switched bottles with my daughter more times than I would like to admit.  She's had gas and discomfort with all of them.  I decided to try Avent bottles...I bought twelve of them and at first they seemed to relieve some of the gas.  But they leak horribly.  Sometimes it's a few drops.  But most times it's like a continuous stream of formula.   ---  --- A couple of times I wasn't paying close enough attention to the bottle while feeding and formula ended up soaking my daughter's bib, her sleep sack, her onesie, and my shirt.  The entire bottle emptied all over us before I knew it...the leak was that fast!  I tried every suggestion given to me:  mixing the formula in a seperate container, mixing it in the bottles, and using sealing disks to mix in the bottle; heating before adding to the bottles, heating in the bottles;  wetting the nipples, not wetting the nipples;  making sure the bottle rim was properly inserted into the nipple ring, etc.   ---  --- I wrote a letter to Avent and called twice about this issue.  Each time, the customer service rep spoke down to me and said I must not have read and followed the directions (which I had).  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE EXPENSIVE, POORLY DESIGNED BOTTLES!!!  These are the worst on the market in my experience. 	neg

Movie: *****  DVD Quality: *****  DVD Extras: *** ---  --- Dramas about _Teenage Gays Coming Out Of The Closet!_ are so plentiful, they sometimes run together in my mind.  "Edge of Seventeen" is an exception to that statement because it genuinely is an exceptional movie in every way.  The screenplay by Todd Stephens is sensitive and true to life, or rather, many people's lives.  It tells the story of Eric (Chris Stafford), a young man growing up in the small town of Sandusky, Ohio, who is just beginning to grapple with his sexual orientation.  What is so refreshing about the script is that Eric is portrayed as neither a victim nor a hero; he's simply a kid on the cusp of adulthood who is trying to find himself.  Eric is sometimes selfish and thoughtless; other times sweet and naive; occasionally manipulative; but generally a good guy ... in other words: completely human.  That holds true of the other characters in the movie, including Eric's parents who love him dearly but aren't quite sure what to make of his fast-changing moods and appearance; his female best friend (Tina Holmes) who harbors deeper feelings for him; and his new gay "family" (headed by Lea DeLaria) who are fiercely supportive, yet sometimes insensitive to where he is at in terms of his coming out process.  Thankfully, Stephens' screenplay remains true to itself right down to the final fadeout and doesn't cop out by trying to wrap everything up into a neat little package; at the end of the movie, there's a definite sense that these characters will continue to live, learn, make mistakes, and thrive.  (Sequel, anyone?) ---  --- The entire cast is uniformly outstanding.  Chris Stafford embodies Eric in all his complexity; his performance never strikes a false note.  Tina Holmes is amazing as his confused female friend; more than once her face and vocal inflections reminded me of an extremely young Meryl Streep (a high compliment indeed).  Stephanie McVay distinguishes herself as Eric's baffled mother, and Andersen Gabrych is fine as Eric's first same sex crush whose confident veneer covers a troubled heart.  Perhaps best of all is comic Lea DeLaria, who turns in a warm and winning dramatic performance as the Earth Mother whose wisdom and understanding are always available to Eric, regardless of how hard he sometimes pushes her away. ---  --- The Strand DVD offers a flawless letterboxed transfer featuring outstanding audio and video.  The somewhat sparse extras are limited to the Theatrical Trailers for "Edge of Seventeen" and five other feature films designed to appeal to LGBT audiences.   It would be wonderful to have the additional benefit of cast and crew biographies and filmographies as a reasearch tool for the viewers who want to explore others works by the filmmakers, but this is a small complaint.  Overall, this is truly a must-see film, one that is worthy of repeat viewings. 	pos
I have to agree with the previous reviewer who noted the temperature discrepancy.  Items placed closer to the firebox do get MUCH hotter than those on the smokestack end.  This is probably my only complaint about this smoker.  This problem can be moderated somewhat.  You can create a makeshift baffle from aluminum flashing that will help some.  You can also put an aluminum drip pan full of water directly in front of the opening which will not only deflect some of the heat but introduce some humidity into the cooking section.  Personally, I just don't fill it up with meat.  If you're doing several slabs of ribs, use a rib rack at the far end.  ---  --- Airflow and temperature control were problems for me at first.  My particular smoker works best with the air intake vent completely closed.  This is not an air-tight smoker so it's still drawing air through the cracks in the door.  By keeping the fire low and the vent closed, the temperature doesn't climb over 250 degrees.   ---  --- Concerning the temperature--forget putting a thermometer in the space provided by Brinkmann.  It's too high on the lid and it will read quite a bit higher than the food at grate level.  Heat rises, you know.  I drilled a hole just above the handle and mounted a thermometer.  When I cook with the grates at the upper level, this thermometer reads just about right for the level of the food.  When I cook on the lower level, the actual temperature will be 30-50 degrees lower than what this thermometer reads.  It's not totally precise but, hey, it's barbeque!!! ---  --- I've had this smoker for about 3-4 years.  I keep it under a covered area so it doesn't get rained on but the humidity in my area is always high.  I've had to repaint it once.  The firebox needs repainting now but that's been the only maintenance I've done to it.  I just clean out the ashes and the food drippings after each use and roll it under the covering until the next time.  Before each use, I line the firebox and the cooking section with heavy duty aluminum foil.  That makes clean-up a lot easier.  (What did we do before Reynolds?) ---  --- I don't smoke a lot with the Brinkmann.  Mostly I use a Weber kettle grill.  But every time I do a brisket or big roast or several slabs of ribs, I crank this baby up and it's never failed me yet.  Keep the temperature low, keep an eye on the fire and don't open the cooking section very often.  Just let nature, low heat and smoke do their job.  	pos
This is a very nice cover, it is heavy-duty and vented at the rear of the top.  Others say this cover fits tight- and it does, but I can get it on and off by myself.  The trick is, since the cover is a little stiff, you can hold it with one hand above the grill, while you use your other hand to guide it on to the grill.  Then it slides down and fits properly.   ---  --- It looks awesome- really sets my grill apart from my neighbors' "unkept" grills! :)	pos
I have owned numerous Celestron telescopes up to 11-inch apertures, so I expected better. I ordered this for my daughter - it arrived defective; the primary mirror had slipped from its bracket, making collimation impossible. In Celestron's defense, it likely happened in transit. Amazon's return policy is not a hassle, and I'm upgrading her to another telescope. I'm sure that had this particular scope not arrived in a defective condition it would have made a great scope. Only criticism is the plugs on the back to cover the collimation screws pop out a bit too easily	neg

This sounds great in theory, being that you don't have to get under the car to drain the oil. Fantastic! But while this has still seemingly been made out to be a great thing for boats and cars, I don't quite agree.

I have had this Kensington FM transmitter for about 2 months and in my hands it has very acceptable sound and not alot of static. ---  --- Unfortunately it has one fatal design flaw that makes listening to classical, jazz and any other type of music with any quiet passages VERY FRUSTRATING.  During the quiet parts the unit will shut itself off causing my car audio to emit a ear piercing screech when it loses the signal. I haven't measured it but it seems like as little a 10-15 seconds of quiet causes this behavior. ---  --- This makes this unit useless for classical music and quite a bit of jazz and other similar styles.  If you listen to quiet music, avoid at all costs.  If you don't it is the best transmitter I have tried. ---  --- Sirandar 	neg

This movie may not be for everyone, but to me it's highly memorable. ---  --- POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT: ---  --- This isn't your ordinary "travel back in time to alter the futures of people you care about"-flick (Back to the Future--although, granted, it was better made and more entertaining). --- Butterfly Effect is really about (in alphabetical order) acceptance, chance, charity, choice, grownup love, hope, identity, opportunity, regret, and sacrifice. ---  --- Some reviewers mentioned the quality of acting.  Here are my thoughts: --- Kutcher to me always seemed an innocent, caring, small town fellow more than the fun guy most of us might know him as, and that's why I wasn't surprised to see him pull off this role.   --- Amy Smart was good mostly, but glaringly off-key at times (granted she had to show more range the the other actors)	pos

This was the first sales book I ever read. And today, 10 years later, I have it proudly displayed in my library. When I speak with clients who I now teach sales skills to, I still reference it from back in my days selling copiers in 1994. Way to go Stephan!	pos
 --- Lorna is pretty, and her suitor is devoted. The story holds your attention. For many that is enough. Some auspicious beginnings, without depth. So maybe 3-stars for some people. I give 2-stars, if I do not keep it to watch again in later years.  ---  --- I found the romance unfulfilling, and so the movie. Romance movies that I liked better are: "North & South", "Pride & Prejudice"-1940, & 1996 & 2006, "Wives and Daughters", and "A Walk to Remember". Adventure with romance: "The Scarlet Pimpernel".	neg
I switched from the Digital Rebel XT. Since I already had L-glass lenses, I didn't run into problems with the 5D "exposing" cheaper lenses. The 17-40mm really shines on the full sensor! The burst rate is simply astonishing. Missing flash doesn't bother me, heck it's a $3000 camera, I don't expect a built-in flash. I have the Speedlite 580EX, which of course is wonderful in itself. I also have the battery grip which I recommend, as well as the RS-80N3 cable release. Image quality is superb overall - the 5D REALLY shines in high ISO numbers - more so than even the 1D from what I've read. Even at 1600 there's hardly any noise. It allows you to take great, crisp photos in low light where other cameras would require a flash.  ---  --- The camera also is quite light while being very sturdy at the same time. The 3 fps might bother some, but I prefer the incredible burst numbers.	pos

I am gluten intolerent, or what ever you want to call it.  I get asthma from wheat flour, so I've spent the last 8 years searching for the perfect flour.  I've been using this for years now, I love this stuff.  I use it for cookies, cakes, crepes, pancakes, waffles*, madalines, yorkshire pudding, flouring meats for crispy frying, thickening soups and sauces, etc etc.  The only thing that it hasn't worked for is bisquits.  I think because this flour needs a binding agent, such as eggs or Xantham Gum.  With just the butter the dough after baking falls apart.  flakey and yummy, but a total mess!   --- It also tastes kind of bitter raw, but once it's baked or cooked it's exactly the same flavor and texture as wheat flour.   ---  --- You can't go wrong with this alternative.   ---  --- Go forth confidently and experiment with all your favorite recipes using this wonderful flour!   ---  --- I love trying Martha Stewart's cookie recipes, this flour works perfectly for all I've tried. ---  --- *Some recipes may require a little extra leavening agent (baking soda or baking powder), such as waffles, madalines and pancakes.  --- 	pos
Purchased this software because I got a deal with a special price break.  I have a very small business, so a purchase of several hundred dollars needs to pay back quickly.   ---  --- The set up took a lot longer than I had anticipated. --- The customer service was no help - couldn't answer my questions.

If this is "Quick Books,"  I need to find "Lightning Fast" Books somewhere	neg
There are some good things about this film -- it gives audiences an idea of how insidious the Nazi propaganda machine was, for one thing. It also shows the main character, Antoine Moreau, a (fictional) famous French mime, having his eyes opened to the reality of the Nazis' 'final solution' to the 'Jewish problem'. Brought to a Czech town that has been 'given to the Jews' by the Nazis in order to stage a performance that will be seen by the Swiss Red Cross delegation, hopefully persuading them that the Germans are not as monstrous as they have been portrayed, Moreau changes his original idea for the performance, hoping to get a 'silent' message to the Red Cross that will let them know the true fate of Jews (and other 'undesirables') at the hands of the Nazis.   ---  --- I'll briefly mention a couple of less-than-positive observations, and then get into my main problem with the film.  The production values reminded me a bit of a made-for-TV movie -- and from time to time it seemed that the sound was a little out of sync with the picture. The image quality on the DVD could have been much better as well.  Also, the Shanachie DVD release is version of the film that has been dubbed with English.  This is, in the case of this film, not very well-done.  The cabaret singer, for instance, comes across as completely unbelievable in that her voice doesn't match her face or ethnicity in the least.  Everyone in the film winds up with an English accent, which detracts from any authenticity that might have been retained using subtitles instead of clumsy dubbing. ---  --- Another reviewer below brought up the dubbing problem as it apples to one of one of the children, Stella (portrayed by Linda Jablonska).  Her voice does not sound at all like that of a little girl. She develops a bit of a crush on Antoine, which in itself seems like a pretty natural occurrence under the circumstances -- here is a famous artist who has come to the village to stage a show, with her as one of the leads, who is kind and supportive and friendly to her, who listens to her ideas and feelings with attention and respect. ---  --- The problem I had was with one scene in particular.  Stella has been caught on the streets after curfew and chased by police.  She bites one of them and manages to elude them by squeezing through a break in a fence.  In the process of getting away, she gets muddy, scrapes herself bloody in a few places, and tears her clothing.  She goes to Moreau's hotel and climbs to the ledge outside his room and taps on the window.  When he opens it, he is shocked at her condition, lets her into the room, and begins to try to clean her cuts and scrapes, asking what had happened.  He then draws a bath for her, so she can wash herself.  As Moreau sits down, still in a bit of a daze over what has happened to her, she steps into the bath.  Just before she pulls her dress over her head, she says to him, `No looking.'  He shakes his head to bring himself out of his daze and says `Of course', then repairs to the adjoining bedroom, where he lies down on the bed to have a smoke, allowing her to conduct her bath in privacy.  A moment later, he hears a noise and looks up to see Stella emerge from the bathroom, completely naked, in a full-frontal nude shot.  Moreau gets up from the bed and lifts the covers, suggesting that she warm herself.  She climbs into the bed; he covers her up, and steps away to the other side of the room.  There is nothing about the scene that implies that anything improper occurred.  He has simply offered her care and comfort and sympathy.  ---  --- This shot only lasts a few seconds, but I feel that, regardless of the director's reasoning for shooting it in the first place, it could have been left out.  If the point was to show that Moreau has either had morals all along, or that he has acquired them, it could have been demonstrated in a variety of other ways. ---  --- Earlier in the film, Stella had witnessed one of her caregivers, semi-nude, in Moreau's hotel room (Stella saw this from outside).  Given her `schoolgirl crush' on Moreau, it seemed natural for her to become upset over this.  As a result, however, the scene after the bath comes across as a young girl inappropriately mimicking adult sexual behaviour.  This, combined with the `adult' voice dubbed over Stella's, makes the scene even more disquieting. ---  --- There are some viewers who might argue that, in Europe, `standards' involving nudity and sexuality are not as reactionary as those in the US.  In many instances, I would wholeheartedly agree with them.  There is much hypocrisy in the dynamics of American culture and moral values, and not a little bit of neurosis.  However, the sexual objectification of children is something about which I feel very strongly...and I think the scene in question in this film amounts to exactly that.  Don't get me wrong -- I'm not so prudish that I turn away from even full-frontal nudity in a film, if it's not gratuitous and it's an integral part of the storyline...but here, it involves a prepubescent girl, and could have easily been left out.  It worries me bit that this point has not been made by other reviewers.  Have we become so numbed in respect to nudity in films that many can't recognize an instance where it's not only unnecessary, but potentially harmful?  ---  --- I'm glad I've seen the film -- and I'd recommend it with a bit of praise and some strong reservations, as noted above. With all of the ridiculous claims from some quarters that the Holocaust never happened, I think it's vitally important for films on the subject to be made and seen.  ---  --- The Czech film ALL MY LOVED ONES is an excellent film about this horrible time that has not gotten the attention it deserves -- seek it out. ---  --- n.b. -- This is the second time I have posted this exact review.  I noticed today (6 April 2006) that it has, for some reason, been removed from the site.  I've re-read what I've written, and I don't see anything objectionable or offensive.  The issues I have with the film are discussed straightforwardly.  If anyone objects to anything I've written here, I'd like to know what it is. 	neg
I really don't have much to say about this book holder, not that it's just a book holder.  It's a nice one.  It does it's job.  It's a little too expensive for just a piece of plastic. ---  --- It's strong, sturdy, and it's big enough, even for those massive heavy textbooks, like the Calculus ones.  Although, I would not recommend putting a dictionary or reference that's like 6" thick (even though it still may hold).  It's got little clamps at the bottom to prevent the page from flipping all over the place, although those tend to fall off when you move them.  But that's no big deal.  Just put them back on.   ---  --- This book holder is kind of big, and I would not put it on a small desk in the middle of a classroom, but it's not too big.  You should be able to put it almost anywhere when studying on your own time. 	pos
This is a good jogger if you will be using it for more than just jogging.  I really like the fact that it has a front swivel wheel that you can lock for jogging and unlock if you need more manuverability.  It comes with cup holders, which is nice because a lot of joggers you need to puchase them as an accessory.  Overall it is a good stroller, the only thing that I would change in the design would be the wheel locking feature.  It has 2 individual locks, one for each wheel.  The jogger I had previously had a bar across the back that would lock both wheels at the same time when pressed.  I am extremely satified with the stroller for the price at which I purchased it	pos
I was surprised to have learn of this very old live performance by Cat Stevens (his name then).  I was well pleased with the quality of the performance format and of the tunes selection.

I've been watching this magazine slide downhill for some time, but they've finally hit bottom.  The bulk of the April 25 2006 magazine was devoted to cars.  Yes, todays automobiles are becoming highly computerized, but the magazine is supposed to highlight the software and hardware that we use on our desktops. ---  --- PC Mag has been drifting far afield, doing articles on Apple computers, gaming systems, and extensive reviews on cameras.  Instead of PCs, the subject seems to be anything that has a computer chip in it, or is in some way remotely related to computers.  The obvious inference is that there's nothing interesting going on in the PC world, so they have to keep stretching just to fill the pages.  I find that hard to believe; I think it's more likely that the staff has lost their focus, or they've hired people who are not interested in or qualified to write about PCs.  The lack of pertinent content makes the dwindling size of the magazine even more apparent.  What used to rival a small phone book is now about the size of Time magazine. ---  --- They now have a "new look", and it's awful.  Their readership used to consist of well educated, technically sophisticated professionals.  These people don't need a dozen arrows pointing into every photograph, with cutesy "handwritten" notes belaboring the obvious.  That's more appropriate for the folks who had a hard time getting through high school and have short attention spans.  Compare this issue to the issues from a couple years ago, and it's obvious that they've "dumbed down" the entire magazine. ---  --- I've subscribed to PC Magazine for years, and considered it a "must read" to keep up with the rapidly evolving hardware and software of the PC world.  But no more -- it's time to find one that has something useful to write on the subject of Personal Computers.	neg

This obviously is a re-release of the OLD "Empire Strikes Back" kit released in the 80's. ---  --- A decent size kit (approx 15 inches) it gives an experience modeler a good opportunity at super detailing. ---  --- The kit is relatively easy to build out of the box, but it has many inaccuracies most notably the inaccurate sensor/bridge deflector DOME on top of the ship. ---  --- These inaccuracies can be addressed by looking in the Internet for replacement parts and articles on addressing those inaccuracies. ---  --- However, the kit is worth the price. ---  --- My only disappointment is the kit is not in scale with the new "Republic Star Destroyer" from "Revenge of the Sith".  The new kit for the new movie is over 19 inches long.  In order for this kit to be in scale with the current movie version, it would need to be about 24 inches long.   ---  --- Hopefully someone will make the "Imperial Star Destroyer" to that scale.	neg

These are NOT pioneer boxes.  These are MBI boxes. I bought them and was very disappointed since I also have bought pioneer boxes before, and when I compared with the MBI, the latter one is much less sturdy and even the index cards are flimpsy compared with the Pioneer's.  Do not buy these. ---  --- Also, Adorama's customer service is very unfriendly in regard to making their customers satisfied.  They insist that they are the same, that I need to return them on my cost, because of their mistake.  They flew from one reason to another with blame from that they have never carried pioneer products, to Amazon's mistake in naming them Pioneer.  But then their own website also has named them Pioneer.  Anyway, just reconsider about buying any products from this company. It's not worth it, considering the shipping is outrageously high.  It is my honest opinion. 	neg
Horrible advertising on these packages.  It shows a huge delicious bowl of pasta when says 4 pack, but it only makes two "bowls" of pasta.  The servings are so tiny, that if you make both packets together, you maybe get a half a bowl of pasta.  Not to mention that it takes about 11-15 minutes to cook!  Pasta's so sticky you have to use no-stick spray.  The taste is so bad my son, who eats anything wouldn't touch it, and the sauce packet was hard as a rock, so it didn't mix up and left big chunks in the ketchup you have to add.  We tried the mac and cheese too, it takes 15 minutes to cook and again says 4 pack, but that's only 2 pastas and 2 cheeses.  Very expensive, hardly any food, and pretty nasty to eat.  They need to be alot more realistic on their packaging instead of trying to use false pictures and saying "4pack"  Eight thumbs down from this family	neg
This movie is far from being anything great. Some of the characters don't make any sense what so ever with the original cast. Leatherface's role has been mocked. People spend too much time focusing on the other people rather than build up Leatherface. The first TCM is a classic. And the second TCM is great as well. But Leatherface: TCM III, The Next Generation, and the TCM remake have all made the Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise a laughing stock. I really hate new directors coming into the horror scene just to mess it up. The only thing they do these days is make crappy remakes and fill horror movies up with CGI. Enough is enough.	neg

I must say my first reaction was to be surprised at how much better Hawking is at explaining modern physics than my college instructors were.  Heisenberg's uncertainty principle was just an equation I learned.  Hawking made it seem like common sense. ---  --- Hawking tries a little too hard to be witty at times (and punctuates all of his jokes with exclamation points! just in case you missed them!), but all-in-all, this was a quite readable account of what's presently known about cosmology.  I use the term "presently" guardedly, as just recently there was some big finding about dark matter (it exists!), but from now on, when there are new findings in physics, I want Hawking to explain them to me, because I feel like then I might understand them.  That's why you should read this book.  ---  --- The reason you should not read this book is because you have no interest in wrestling with abstractions with which you will never interact in daily life, and would rather read about global warming or Darfur or something a bit more topical and practical.  This was still a hard read, and I feel like I grasped maybe 80% of it.  For you to decide, but for a former engineering student, this was something I wish I had read when I was taking physics	pos

Our library has just finished its magazine usage count, and to my surprise the American Spectator came dribbling in with only a couple of hits, measured by current copies left on the table and check outs of older issues. And yet our patronage here is very conservative. Perhaps people who once read this sort of thing no longer read at all, or maybe, as a couple of reviewers suggested, with Bill Clinton out of office, it no longer has the same appeal.  --- You can change my rating to five stars if you like, for the sake of ideology, but you still won't read the thing. Just like I don't read the Nation anymore	neg
I used this tub for my first born. This is small and holds very little water, therefore, the water gets cold fast! Also, there are holes where the tub folds up so the water spills out of the holes as the baby moves. It can be messy if you are giving your baby a bath on the floor as I did.  ---  --- Our baby would stick her foot and leg out of the tub because it's so small...when I used larger tub, that didn't happen. ---  --- One positive thing that I can say about this product is that it's compact...I kept it at my mother's house and it didn't take up much space. ---  --- I would recommend spending an extra $10 to $15 and buy a higher quality tub. 	neg

Our $10 piece of junk umbrella stroller (you know the one) bit the dust on a 10 day trip to Europe so in a bit of emergency we got this one at Harrod's in London, and about had a cow paying 60 pounds for this exact stroller. Turns out it's the best one we could have gotten and the price was right. You can't go wrong. It's sturdy, well-balanced, super easy to fold up and carry around (sling it over your shoulder--it's that light) and has a nice larger sun/rain shield (ours happened to come with a rain cover as well, but this was in London and I don't know if this US version comes with it automatically). The color orange is great for boys or girls and bright enough for pedestrian/traffic awareness. Love it. Like many people, with two kids we calculated that we've gone through half a dozen strollers over the past 8 years (how does that happen?! car seats, too) and this is the best so far. Go for it	pos
I had been on the look out for a Mary Jane pump that I could wear to work with pants and skirts. I finally found this shoe online and decided to give it a try. Usually Steve Madden's run big on me, so I got a size smaller, and surprisingly, it was actually too small. A half size up did the trick, however. ---  --- I love that it comes in patent leather because it really adds a kick to your feet. They're also very comfortable for a high-heeled shoe. ---  --- My only complaint is that the show is actually very deep on the top, and there's quite a bit of toe cleavage. I guess this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it just didn't look like that at all in the picture. Also, the strap that goes across the top of the foot is very low, and if you have wide feet, it could make your feet look even wider (or fatter).  ---  --- Despite those two small flaws, I really like this shoe and find that I can wear it with almost anything (they look especially cute with skirts)	pos
As both a big fan of this movie and a film student, I feel that critics have been quick to judge this film as bad trash. This film has a sexy edge to it, that many other films in the "teen film" genre dare to exhibit. New Best Friend fullfills a fantasy for those girls who secretly desire to live dangerously and party every night, without it actually becoming a reality. The house is every girl's dream, and these girls are alluring and suavely tempting. The acting is far from terrible, and it was great to see Meredith Monroe  in a more sophisticated and darker role than her role as Andie in Dawson's Creek. Dominique Swain once again puts in an A+ effort for her role as the cheeky deviant Sydney. For anyone who loved films like Tart and Cruel intentions,this is the film for you. 	pos

I bought two of these pieces of junk, and believe me they do NOT work unless your room is about 3 feet by 3 feet by 3 feet.  ---  --- IT RECIRCULATES THE SAME AIR OVER AND OVER IN A TINY AREA! ---  --- When they say it cleans 700 cubic feet per hour, that is simply what the fan can MOVE per hour not what it actually will clean in a 10 foot by 10 foot by 7 foot room. ---  ---  --- The fan is so weak at full speed you can barely feel it. Really it is sucking in air through the bottom and blowing it out at the top. Both the inlet and outlet are facing the same side so you are basically recirculating most of the same air over and over again. This thing would need to be 7 feet tall to really work well.  ---  --- In a hospital they have HUGE systems that MOVE the air past LARGER ARRAYS of bulbs. ---  --- So here you are sitting in a room with your kids coughing on one side and this thing recirculating the same air over and over again, in a little tiny airspace, what a great deal. Just be ready to buy 10 of them per room. ---  --- Maybe you can try hanging 5 on the celiing and putting 5 on the floor of a  4' x5' bathroom and it might work in a week. ---  --- Do yourself a favor, and buy a machine that has more UV light bulbs, and has a greater airflow so ALL the air in a room is moving and ALL of the air in the room goes through the filter. ---  ---  --- I gave it a one because it looks nifty. --- 	neg
I agree with the reviews from the other reviewers.  It basically ruined my nails the first time I used it.  However what I did discover is that this is an excellent products for keeping my dogs claws trimmed.  After trimming their claws you often get rough edges.

I made this purchase in Oct has a X-mas gift.  They arrived and at quick glance appeared to be fine.  I immediately wrapped the earrings and they were hidden away.  X-mas morning after my young daughter open her gift I more closely examined them.  One of the earrings was completely grayish in color; so dark that I would consider it to be defective.  I called the Netaya customer service phone number only to be greeted with "Hello".  After verifying that I had indeed reached Netaya I briefly explained the defect and requested that I be permitted to return the earrings.  I was placed on hold and then told that "the lady" I needed to speak with was busy and I would need to call back or send an e-mail.

Honestly, Led Zeppelin is the ONLY artist that can create monumental album after monumental album and have not ONE bad song.  When you listen to one of their albums in your car, there's no, "Oh, I really like track 2, but I don't like the next couple, so I'll skip to track 5 after that one's over."  Now it is common opinion that the classic albums of Led Zeppelin are the first five, and "Houses of the Holy" is the fifth one.  This is Zeppelin at their pinnacle, which in my opinion, they never fall from. ---  --- "The Song Remains the Same" is Pagey at his best with his Gibson double-neck.  The song itself makes you want to ride the wind because it is so airy, but at the same time a fast-paced rock tune.  Page's initial (and INCREDIBLE) guitar solo makes this song the perfect initial song on this album. --- "The Rain Song" is a lovelorn masterpiece with the lovely sounds of an orchestra to help create this mood.  The lyrics are deep, and while the song to me is melancholy, it is also refreshing. --- "Over the Hills and Far Away" is a 5-trillion star song, with amazing acoustic and electric guitars with mystic lyrics. --- "The Crunge" is groovy and funny.  The bass is really felt in this song, and odd spoken lyrics at the end give a laugh. --- "Dancing Days" is very far out, but a summer-y song with an addictive riff. --- "D'yer Mak'er" is one to definitely highlight Bonzo's masterful rhythm skills, or in other words, GREAT DRUMS!  Equal to that is Pagey on guitar and Robert's singing, "I still love you so...but I can't let you go..." --- "No Quarter" is the quiet masterpiece that is credited to John Paul for an exquisite keyboard solo. --- "The Ocean" is quite the upbeat song on this album with a raunchy riff.  An overall energizing song. ---  --- This is the best deal for this album--do not pass it up!  I hope this will be a permanent fixture to your collection...not one bad song	pos

We purchased this rooftop cargo carrier to transport our suitcases and beach items during our summer vacation to New England.  We were initially concerned because it was so inexpensive for the size and worried that it might not fit a Trailblazer.  Upon arrival we were pleased to find that it not only fit securely, but was rather stylish too.  Although it appeared weatherproof we soon found that it was not.  It began raining at the onset of our trip.  About four hours in to our fourteen hour roadtrip the weatherproof lining began disintingrating.  By the time we arrived at our destination all our possessions were soaked and coated in tiny grey vinyl flecks.  This cargo hauler might be cheap and look nice, but it is not worth your money	neg
This is The Jacksons second album for epic and producers Gamble and Huff. It would be their last with Gamble and Huff but together they made a great album that doesnt get the play it should. Music's Takin Over, Different Kind of Lady and Do What You Wanna are great, catchy dance tracks. The real greatness here lies in the ballads where Michael's voice is in peak form. Even Though You're Gone and Find Me A Girl are classic ballads. So good, I feel that Find Me A Girl is probably the best Michael Jackson song you've never heard. This is probably Michael Jackson's most overlooked album and its one of his best! The Jacksons all sing together great and you can see why Destiny and Triumph were such big hits after this one was recorded. Overall, great ballads, catchy feel good dance tracks, and Michael Jackson singing his heart out. Get this, you will not be dissaponted	pos

I find I cannot eat processed starch--upsets my stomach, so these are a total lifesaver. And the slightly slippery soft texture is soothing. Love'em	pos

Elegant and simple design with that awesome rubber handle that put OXO Good Grips on the "grip map". I bought this to complete my Good Grips BBQ set. The only thing it lacks that some BBQ'rs may miss is a bottle opener on the end of the handle. But that doesn't bother me seeing as I don't drink beer and it also gives the tool a cleaner design. If the dog doesn't get ahold of it, it will last a lifetime	pos

I have several dummies books, from how to build a PC to CCNA.  I had to read this rediculous book when I worked for a very well known DSL provider on the East Coast.  This book was trivial, assumes that you are completely mindless and plugs certain products and services shamelessly.  Yes, I agree, Hot Bot is a pretty good search engine...but it is not the only one out there.  This book has technical incosistansies throughout and is basically a really really long advertisement.  Easily the worst dummies book in print, and Im not being a jerk, I love dummies books, Ron Gilster rocks, but this is absolute crap.  You can honestly get more informed with a magazine	neg
We opened 2 Razor Bumper Buggy's for Hanukkah that we got as gifts from a family member.  Both of them were missing the charger for the battery (and other hardware), so our kids couldn't even play with them.  They were very disappointed.  What is worse, Razor's customer service is TERRIBLE!  They would not send us the missing chargers without a receipt.  Of course, since they were gifts, we didn't have the reciept.  Razor refused to help us until we could get proof of purchase from a credit card statement, which won't be for a couple of weeks.  Then of course it will take a couple more weeks to actually get the chargers.  All this hassle, all the hours on the phone, when they could have just sent us the missing chargers, like any decent company would for such a high price item!   ---  --- Our poor kids, just looking at their motionless bumper cars. ---  --- Of course, we can't actually review whether the prodcut is any good or not until sometime in Februrary when we actually get to use it.   ---  --- Happy Hanukkah to you too, Razor	neg
I bought this ring for my fiance, since i have one, and it's a terrible ring.  We got it apart, and then.....have not been able to get it back together, it's been over a month now, we went online to get the directions, that didn't help either. Plus, the ring is so cheap, it warmed up with the effort from our hands and bent out of shape. It is cheap and completely useless.	neg
A Clean and refreshing scent. Not heavy at all - its top notes are citrus based, and this is  appropriate for day or night wear. It is one of my favorites. It reminds me a little of Happy for Women, which I love, but don't wear, because of its distinctly feminine smell. Cudos to Clinique. Happy is a terrific man's cologne, it smells clean but not like laundry soap ( which too many men's colognes smell like these days )	pos
I just received this today.  Somehow I completely missed that the pendant is on a silver-wrapped wire and not a chain.  Had I noticed that, I probably would not have ordered this piece - and I would have missed out.  It is very nice.  It has a nice weight to it - not too heavy, but substantial.  The wire lays on my neckline just right, and the pendant looks beautiful. I'm very pleased with it.	pos
Here's another great film that sprung forth from the Czech New Wave: another film that, through its small gestures and subtleties makes some big statements. I'll leave it for you all to discover Forman's delightful insights into human behavior in LOVES OF A BLONDE. Suffice it to say, the plot---which involves a young girl's (Hana Brejchová) attempt to find true love as a factory girl---could have become whimsical and even sentimental in other hands. In Forman's, the whole thing is grounded on earth. Instead of being a weightless romantic comedy, LOVES OF A BLONDE aims for realism, and while Forman maintains a relatively light touch on the proceedings, everything that happens to her---she finds love in a piano player, makes love to him one night, and then eventually pursues him to his home, where she meets his ever-bickering parents---still has its own kind of weight to it. The only way I can describe it is, I guess, the weight of real life. I haven't seen a more accurate recreation of a marriage that has dulled out in any other movie than I saw in the second half of LOVES OF A BLONDE, with Milda's parents: it is comic, yes, but it is also uncannily realistic, and maybe you'll recognize your own parents when you see the control-freak mother and the carefree father in this film. As for the blonde of the movie...well, she doesn't necessarily become sympathetic as the movie progresses, but we get a sense of why she begins to attach herself to the piano player Milda: she sees him as an escape from the drudgeries of factory life. Understand that, and you'll find the ending of this film poignant and maybe kinda sad. (Her dream has been shattered, but she keeps on believing it anyway, either out of hope or simply desperation.) ---     ---    But enough of my pretentious analysis, hehe. The point is, Milos Forman's LOVES OF A BLONDE, like Jiri Menzel's arguably more celebrated CLOSELY WATCHED TRAINS, is a film that, though short at 85 minutes, takes its time to observe human nature in the face of oppression, in its own light and subtle way. Its comic surface only makes it seem like a slight movie; but in its subtleties and scenes of comic observation, it has a heck of a lot more to say about our little human foibles than a lot of other romantic comedies do.

This smoker works like a charm! The only regret I have is that it is a bit larger than I expected, I should have bought the next size down. Other than that the times I have used it the results were great. Temperature is easy to control and that was the main concern as I wanted sometime I didn't have to babysit while I was smoking my ribs or pork shoulder. Others have complained about receiving the units damaged, I guess I was lucky, there was a slight crease in one corner but I was able to straighten it out easily. Better packaging would be an improvement. My .02 is that it is well worth the investment	pos

I assumed, incorrectly, that Adobe's customer service would be professional and quick. I have called three times in the past two weeks and have had to wait, at a minimum, 23 MINUTES just to speak to someone.  --- When I finally got my product, they sent the Mac verion rather than the PC version I purchased. I called again and waited approximately 30 MINUTES to get customer help. I had originally ordered the PC Standard version and asked to upgrade (and pay difference) for the Professional version -- since I still hadn't received the PC version. Customer service stated that they would ONLY ship me the Standard version to replace the incorrectly shipped Mac Version and then I would have to wait for the Standard verison to arrive at which point I could call again, and ask to exchange for the Professional verion - INSANE!!!  Adobe's call center is easily the worst customer service I have dealt with -- and I've dealt with some bad customer service	neg

I wish I could write a review of this product, unfortunately I cannot because the vendor (Verdent) is dishonest. You see Amazon requires all outside vendors to ship all orders within two business days. Verdent Gifts thought they could just sidestep this little detail, not ship my order for 9 days and feed me a line of BS on top of that. Yes, I called the vendor and he told me quote " we are having a difficult time getting UPS to pick up our orders", what a crock unless you are't paying your UPS shipping bills. --- Anyway, to make a long story short, Amazon did try to help and is refunding my money after they tried to get Verdent gifts to make the refund, Verdent refused, so Amazon is picking up the tab...and hopefully giving the boot to Verdent Gifts in the process. Avoid a headache and hassle, steer clear of these bums (Verdent Gifts) and thier dishonest practices	neg

This is a simple book to read through for younger children. Written by native Americans it is a "thanksgiving" book from their point of view, why native americans have always celebrated thanksgiving.

I could not help but to watch this film with all of my African American female sensibilities. Despite the proficient acting, cinematography and directing, I found the content highly offensive and trite. Mr. Kinksy claimed to love Shanduri and was willing to do anything to possess her affections. He was put off to find out that Shanduri was married, but not deterred. Shanduri gave him what she believed was an unattainable challenge to have her husband, who was arrested for speaking out against the government, freed from an African prison. I recognize that it is possible for a servant to fall in love with her employer, however I know that it is extremely rare. (Ask any black woman who's cleaned a white person's house, `how much love do you have for your boss.' The relationship between Shanduri and Mr. Kinksy was one of abuse of power and emotional manipulation. During the `relationship' that I watched develop, not once did Shanduri refer to her employer by his first name. Clearly indicating an uneven balance of power and control...not much different from a slave owner offering to free his children born to his African concubine. So, Mr. Kinksy gave up some of his prized possessions; it was European influence that created the climate that allowed Shanduri's husband to be detained indefinitely. Though I am one among several with a different review about the film, I have no reason to forget the long history of abuse past and present that women of color experienced at the hands of white people, especially white men. To see such a film is an insult and another example of how Europeans do not understand the masses of African Americans	neg
This is an exact replacement for the high quality, precision made suction cup mount that comes packaged with the Nuvi unit. Unlike many such suction cup products, this one sticks. I bought an extra for ease in "cross-decking" my one Nuvi unit between my two cars. I just leave the mounts in place on the windshields of both cars and move the Nuvi and power cord to whichever car I am using at the moment. A good convenience. Note that I attach this mount to the windshield. I have not tried the red-disc mounting plate that allows the mount to be attached to a pebbly-textured dashboard... I was scared off by the warning that ones you attach the red disk it is extremely hard to remove.	pos

I bought this headset from retailer (offline), and returned it the next day. First off, I have to make it clear that I had NO problems with sound. Even though the speakers could have been just a tiny bit bigger (they use 40mm drivers), the sound quality of the headset was just fine. ---  --- However, when it comes to wearing these headphones, the only words that come to mind are "uncomfortable as sin". The awkward squarish shape of the cups made it hard to get any kind of decent seal around the ears (and a bad seal on closed-back headphones ultimately leads to poor sound isolation). Also, I have no idea what material they used for the cup pads, but it is nowhere near soft enough... in fact, I litterally couldn't wear these things for more than five minutes without my ears turning red (flush) from discomfort. Mind you, I also own a cheap pair of Koss headphones I can keep on for hours at a time, so my ears are definitely no stranger to being cupped in speakers either... but these things, they just plain hurt to wear after a very short period of time, which isn't good at all. Discomfort and being unable to obtain a good seal around the ears were ultimately the main reasons for the return.  ---  --- If your ears are tough, you should have no problem with this headset. The sound quality is decent and it should work just fine for you. However, if you're looking for comfort and good sound isolation, you'll want to look elsewhere..	neg
I echo the comments of the previous reviewers.  Don't waste your money.  Not only does this book present a tedious repetition of facts and stories already well known to even a casual U2 fan, it can't even get those facts right!  The book states that Bono's father dropped the family off at a Catholic Church before driving himself to another church.  This contradicts the correct statement on the preceding page that Bob Hewson was Catholic, while Bono, his mother and brother were Protestant.  In the same paragraph the Dublin neighborhood of "Glasnevin" is misspelled "Asnevin".  The hearing aid shop from which Bono took his name is misspelled, and perhaps most galling of all, the author can't even get the full name of Larry Mullen, Jr. right!  And this is just chapter one!   ---  --- I have to agree that this book was simply thrown together to make a quick buck and therefore not worth purchasing.  I would suggest skipping this one and purchasing Bono: In Conversation With Michka Assayas, which includes a pretty good account of Bono's life from the man himself. 	neg

Enough already! ---  --- One more time. Now, what was I saying?  ---  --- Oh, yeah ... Pinnacle Studio can assist the amateur videographer in editing some fairly interesting video ... if you can keep it up and running. ---  --- Got the idea? ---  --- Just adding my voice to the chorus of those have experienced the frustration of the Pinnacle products. This is a bargain-priced product for which you will pay the cost of long hours of irritation and heart-pounding races to meet project deadlines -despite the software malfunctions.  ---  --- After installing the program, installing the patches, uninstalling the program and patches and reinstalling the program and the patches, I am still experiencing too many crashes. ---  --- If you intend to use this program to piece together a video of Uncle Morty's birthday party, the family vacation or your neighbor's kid's bar mitzvah, the cost and the ease of this program may outweigh the annoyance of its aforementioned weakness. If, however, your video projects fit under the category of "job description," then I suggest spending the money for Adobe Premiere	neg
I didn't want to pay over $50 for a sports bra, but I really wanted a good product and the reviews promised that. So I shelled out the dough for one and they were right! It fits snug so there's no unwanted bouncing and it also prevents uni-boob. I ordered a different sports bra from Champion and this is by far my favorite of the two. The Champion one pushed my boobs in so much it made that ugly boob bump above the bra line that's visible in light t-shirts - ew - and they're supposed to be the same bra size so go figure.  More positives: this one also fastens securely (just start from the bottom and work your way up, it will fit!) and is super, super comfortable. I do wish the price were less so I could buy a second, but I'll have to put that in my budget.  Nevertheless, as a wannabe runner with a large chest, it was worth the investment in comfort and security	pos
It has been a long time since I read the novel upon which this book is based, but I do clearly remember it making sense.  This movie doesn't even make sense (to quote a chicken I know).  Marlon Brando somnambulizes his way through the film and, instead of coming off as sinister, menacing, and dominating, he makes Dr. Moreau into a joke.  Val Kilmer's portrayal is vacuous and silly.  Is the character supposed to be under the influence?  I guess he wanted it portrayed that way.  The script?  Is there one?  Moreau talks about having almost reached his goal.  Where?  His one "son" and his "daughter" do have some fine traits, but both are also pretty ineffectual. ---  --- Several reviews have mentioned the special effects.  I actually saw very few special effects.  The rat-people on the boat were creepy and well-done, and some of the characters did make some superhuman moves, but mostly I saw people in very elaborate, well-done costumes, using well-distorted voices. ---  --- The central character, played by David Thewlis, should have been the focus of the movie, as he is the narrator.  He kept getting lost in the shuffle, and I kept waiting for him to see things that I saw, and to ask the questions that I would have asked.  I like him as an actor, but this is certainly not a memorably good performance.  It is somewhat ironic that he is the witness to animal-human hybrid horror here, but is the werewolf in "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban." ---  --- The film does create a sense of the nightmare.  Several of the characters do show glimpses of depth and genuineness, most notably Ron Perlman's preacher, but then he's well-practiced, from his "Beauty and the Beast" television series.  That was what (barely) earned this film its second star.  Let's vote them all off the island, and start over.  Robert Duvall as Moreau?  Replace Kilmer with Matt Damon?  Casey Affleck replacing David Thewlis	neg
I had never eaten a Luna bar before I made this purchase, so I had expectations that were not even close to being fufilled.  ---  --- When I read "chocolate Pecan Pie" .. I expected just that.. the taste of rich chocolate, with nutty pecans and a gooey sugary base.  What I received was a bar with little taste, nothing at all similar to the name on the bar.  ---  --- In my opinion, the bar is edible if you have no expectations of it... the flavor is barely there. The bar is dry. It is never again be on my "purchase" list  	neg
I ordered before brent birckhead's review came up and I got taken. This is not a leather case for LG enV VX-9900. The correct internal dimension is: 4" x 1 3/4" x 0.5", clearly not a size that the VX9900 can fit into. ---  --- Considering that the seller enters the "product dimensions" as 4 ounces instead of the measurments, one might suspect that this may not be an honest mistake. ---  --- I think Amazon needs to take better responsibility of ensuring that the sellers fill out the description properly	neg

I bought this seat because we have a small eating area in our kitchen, too small for a full-size high chair.  The seat has worked wonderfully from age 5 months to now age 21 months.  I do find the seat hard to recline or sit up but I have only had to do that a handful of times as once you find the right setting for your child it stays there until he/she is ready for the next setting.  The cloth lining is very easy to remove, wash, and put back and the plastic under the seat cover is easy to wipe clean.  The tray is easy to put on, remove and again wipe clean or wash off in the sink.  I have also found the seat easy to take on and off the dining chair when I need the chair for entertaining others.  My daughter has never complained about sitting in the seat and, now that we are no longer using the tray but still using the seat as a booster, enjoys having her own place at the table.  I highly recommend this seat for parents looking to conserve space in their dining areas but not sacrifice convenience or comfort. 	pos

The light was very good, the magnifier (very tiny) made of plastic which was optically difficult to look thru if you already wear glasses.  But the worst part were the tweezers in themselves.  They were difficult to squeeze togeter because of their placement on the handle.  Also, I am used to sharp tweezers that come together tightly over the hair.  These did not.  So they do not tweeze well at all.  Wasn't worth all the bother of a return.  I just threw it away.  It was a good idea for a product, just poorly made. 	neg

The reviewer below identifying himself as "An Electronics Fan" obviously has a deep bias against Bose.  His multiple reviews about Bose products--here and elsewhere--are transparently motivated by some animus against Bose.  Was he fired by Bose? Did a member of the Bose family reject his romantic advances?  Did a Bose executive accidentally run over his cat?  Did he drop a Bose speaker on his foot and hurt his toe? The true motivation for this guy's negative reviews would be fun to know.  In the meantime, what we do know is that he has no credibility, and his reviews (two here, others elsewhere for other Bose products; he's made maligning Bose his life's work, apparently)) should disregarded. ---  --- I bought a set of black 301's several years ago to go with my Onkyo receiver.  We have it hooked up to a television and DVD player for movies.  These speakers are in constant use both for the DVD and for music of all types.  The room in which they are placed is huge, with an 18 foot-high flat ceiling.  The speakers saturate the room with exquisite sound day after day. The speakers work fine for spoken audio for DVD's; we can hear dialogue perfectly; I feel no particular need for a surround-sound system. Several times my young daughters have turned on the 100 watt amp with the volume turned all the way up or close thereto. I feared a ruptured speaker cone, but the 301's are very forgiving, no damage has been done. The cats sleep on the speakers; they clean right up and still look new after five years.  These speakers keep on giving total satisfaction, and I quite simply love them. ---  --- About three years ago I decided to go all out in another room and bought the highest quality stereo stuff on the market, or at least what I determined to be best after a lot of research. This included a set of the gold-series tower speakers from Monitor Audio. (The speaker cones are metallic, with some amount of gold, and gold connections, etc., etc.) These Monitor Audios have to be the best looking speakers ever made (real wood veneer cabinetry, with the gold cones and the black covers, etc.). These speakers cost well over a thousand dollars each.  Well, I must confess, as awesome as the Monitor Audios sound, I can't really say they sound any better than the Bose 301's!!! They can maybe handle more power, but I assure you the Bose 301's will play loud enough to bring the cops to your doorstep in five minutes or less. ---  --- So, when I recently set up my third stereo in a bedroom, I looked forward to buying a third type of speakers.  I ran around and listened to what I could find on display.  Well, after much contemplation, I went for a second set of the Bose 301's!!!  They just couldn't be beat, and I would have gladly spent more if I had found something I liked better. But I'm not going to spend more just so I can say I spent a lot...there has to be increased performance. And, in my opinion, the 301's couldn't be out-performed by any other bookshelf speaker of any price range.  ---  --- My first set of 301's were black.  This time I went for the cherry. Folks, these are absolutely beautiful speakers: almost as cool looking as my Monitor Audios.  The black cover and the black housing fixture in the back really accentuate the cherry colored wood. No, it is not real wood, but it looks very nice.  These things are simply gorgeous. The kind of "mod" or futuristic shape which Bose has designed really stands out in this lighter-colored version.  And, yes, they sound just as good as my original pair.  I listen to soft music (jazz, typically, or ambient) in the morning and these speakers deliver all the nuances at very low volume; I listen to hard rock at high volume on other occasions, and the 301's don't scare away or distort at all: these things would tear the house apart before they'd lose sound quality. ---  --- So, yes, I recommend these highly.  They'd still be the speaker of choice for me at three or four times the price	pos

Grew up on this group. Love them then and love them now. Own the "Best of" Collection but you can never compile the best on one CD. For those Winans fans you know what I'm talking about. These brothers are music genuises especially Marvin Winans. Like Stevie Wonder they were ahead of their time. My favorite song on this album shares the message of all times. "Together We Stand" opens up the eyes to all race,religion, and creed that its time to come together if we want to see a change in this world regardless of background. Entire album is great including the celebrity appearances such as Stevie Wonder, Teddy Riley, and Aaron Hall.  I like the flavor the cameos add to this album.

The watch performs as advertised. ---  --- Atomic clock.  I live 2k miles from Ft. Collins and the watch automatically syncs every night, even if I don't put it near a window. ---  --- Solar recharge.  The watch arrived with a low battery.  It charged up to full after sitting in the sun for an afternoon.  Since then it has been on full charge with no special actions on my part. ---  --- The watch is big and heavy.  I take it off when typing because it slides down to the end of my wrist and knocks against my hand. ---  --- The watch's user interface is unintuitive.  This is the first watch I've owned where I had to read (and re-read) the manual to set an alarm or the hourly charm. I find the Timex interface and the old-style Casio interface much easier to use. ---  --- In the interests of saving battery power, the alarms are short and quiet.  I can't count on this watch's alarms to wake me up.  It'd be nice if the watch had a power-hog mode with loud insistent alarms and long illuminations. ---  --- All in all, I like the watch.  It is nice to have a digital watch that sets its own time and doesn't run out of batteries.

I bought this product for my husband. He tried it out on one of the hottest days. Sunny and 90 degrees. He is very particular on how he washes our vehicles and it usually takes a few hours. This really works. Not only did it cut the time it takes to wash the cars but it is amazing. It looked as if he did the vehicles the old way. There were no streaks. The truck looked like it was polished. Unbelievable...... I would recommend this product to anyone. Buy it !!!!!!	pos
Alien invasion stories have been done to death since H.G. Wells gave us The War Of The Worlds so it is extraordinarily difficult to come with a new slant to this time-honored genre. Well, William C. Dietz pulls it off with Death Day and the concluding volume Earth Rise. What sets Death Day apart from most of the invasion tradition is, first of all, the invading force being made up of different races. This makes an interesting dynamic and gives the enemy character as their squabbles, in-fighting and fight for freedom (some are slaves to others) make for something new, different and engaging. Also, using racism amonst the aliens as well as the surviving human population rings a true, and tragic, note. The surviving pockets of humanity withdraw within themselves, close off their borders and horde resources. The aliens favor people of color and place them as overseers as human slaves are forced to work building alien temples on Earth. And, sadly, collaborators work with the invading force to control the humans. But the seeds of rebellion have been planted. Humans and enslaved aliens are fighting back and this first book sets up an alliance between the enslaved races. All this is interesting stuff and makes for a fresh approach. I enjoyed this book and recommend it highly. Dietz is the best SF writer working today when it comes to letting character drive the story no matter the setting. 	pos
I was expecting this book to be a great story, but very disappointed. I cannot believe the publisher allowed the author to publish this book as it is. The book is insipid and dull,  has no flow, no story, or no plot. Let me present an example. I have read many insightful Newsweek articles by a writer Allan Sloan. For example, Sloan describes a Sprint merger event in this way, "If talk is getting cheaper, why did MCI WorldCom pay $115 billion to buy Sprint? The once staid phone companies have launched a merger blitzkrieg in an effort to emerge at the center of the wired world. Can regulators handle the complex new order....."  It has a clear logical axis, and has a force to attract readers into it.  ---  --- But Jeter describes it like this,  "The merger announcement of WorldCom and Sprint spurred building activity around Worldcom headquarters as real estate developers readied for economic prosperity. The real estate inventory swelled with new planned unit....." It always presents off-center, trivial detail which makes a reader bored. 70% of books are consumed to described a dry and dull fact, like "the merger of company A & B raised the stock to $X" etc. There is no insight here.  ---  --- But unfortunately, unlike Enron scandal, there is no other book that centered on the Worldcom scandal. You would get much better comprehension by collecting articles in Newsweek or Business Week, if you have LexisNexis or EBISCOhost.	neg
Much has been said about the technical aspects or systems requirements of the game, as have many reviews for Oblivion and other next-gen or advanced games on the market today.  Caesar III was quite old, the sequel was always going to be further along with the system demands.  It was worth the wait. ---  --- Let's talk about the game: ---  --- The basic gameplay is intuitive.  Not a lot you haven't done before.  The interface is pretty standard and can be minimized off the screen for screenshots or just zooming around without distraction.  Which you really should do.  As with all these types of games, you can spend a lot of time building and developing.  You need to get a cup of tea and sit back with this one, for the closeup views of the city at work and at play is what is so new here. ---  --- The graphics look somewhat standard on a zoom out, top down view.  There is a lot that looks familiar.  Until you start to get a closer look and the texture details come to life and you realize there is another level of realism here as you watch the shadows lengthen along the plaza near the sparkling fountain as the midday sun moves across the sky and the trees sway in the breeze.  Wow.  No other Roman game out currently comes close. ---  --- This has everything you always wanted with Caesar III and had somewhat with CoTN, (Children of the Nile) although the buildings here are more substantial and better realized.  The CoTN feature of being able to follow behind a person as they move on the streets, saving you the hassle of trying to maneuver the camera views to get a realistic walkthru experience, is one that they should have implemented here.   ---  --- I would have liked to see more variety in the housing, also in the goods, particulary food.  There are only three foods, grain, vegetables and meat - cattle.  No figs, cheeses, fruits, pork, chicken or fish.  The production lines are very simplified, with no bakeries for bread and no weavers for cloth.  The grain goes to the households and the wool straight to clothing or armor factories. ---  --- More decorative options should have been available as well.  Overall, while the quality of what exists is very good, there is certainly room for an expansion.  I hope that they do address these things in games to come.  It's part of the appeal and adds to the longevity and continued interest in the game. ---  --- The maps are overall somewhat small, although a game this graphic intensive would have to reasonably limit the size to facilitate performance.  There are very limited sandbox modes available, at least for now, and I can find no user created scenarios currently available due in part to the complexity of the unsupported editor. ---  --- But again, what there is is very good indeed.  All of the structures are beautifully done with attention to detail.  The landscape can be breathtaking, with a variety of ways to put your city together around the terrain.  And enough hustle and bustle on the city streets to bring it to life.  And did I mention that you can zoom all the way down INTO an arena or colliseum, watch closeups of the games or swivel around from the floor of the arena and watch all the spectators coming in and out and moving around or cheering? ---  --- I am currently running a mid-line gaming system with a NVidia 6800, a system that can run Oblivion fairly well.  I had to update some drivers as well as defragment my hard drive to run this game smoothly.  I hadn't experienced many lags until I had built up a larger city or had been playing for several hours and my system started to protest. ---  --- I replaced the game launcher icon installed by the game to the Desktop or Program Files with a shortcut I created from the game file Caesar.exe to actually get the game to start, something I found from the forums was a consistent problem. ---  --- There are some bugs with the trade routes.  Opening them before you have goods doesn't seem to be the problem as much as setting the ports to sell goods you will sell but don't have in stock yet.   ---  --- I'm not thrilled with the number of people it takes to man each prefect, but it usually seems to work well enough, except on high speeds where the frequency of fires seems to increase, but if you have more than two or three buildings burning you are better off destroying those and rebuilding than waiting for them to get put out.  You can easily find your entire city in flames very quickly! ---  --- While it certainly has a few faults, most things are a matter of preference and having an adequate, clean system.  The core game itself is fundamentally solid.  It takes work to build up economic stability based on trade and taxes and how well you handle your production chains.  You can create, with any scenario, stable cities that will largely run themselves, aside from the requests/demands from the Empire.   ---  --- Your ratings screen will tell you things you need to do to meet your goals.  For instance - Prosperity would also mean higher levels of housing, especially villas, as well as successful taxation and trade.  Better educational coverage not only affects the Culture rating, it affects the Security rating because better education means less crime  as will having good coverage for Jupiter, who will frequently remove all criminals as his blessing.  Good religious coverage will affect both your Prosperity and Culture ratings as you then evolve your housing.  The military will automatically meet a threat to the city and doesn't require a lot of micromanagement as long as you have everything in place and well supplied. ---  --- With the stable gameplay, depth, realistic economic simulation, great music and breathtaking graphics, it's not only a very good game but the best of the current selection of city-builders.  So if you have to chose, I would recommend this one first.  Enjoy	pos
Bought mine sometime around Christmas and took it into the water for the first time on a trip to St Thomas last week.  It died within 10 minutes of being in the water.

The software requires a "patch"...not a big deal. ---  --- Once I got the thing up and running my attention span was about 5 minutes.  The "goofiness" is a detriment and the aspect of trying to learn is hindered by the balance of trying to figure out how to use the software. ---  --- It has a tutorial but that is a waste of time as well. ---  --- If you are SERIOUS about trying to learn some basic conversational Spanish, try something else.  Don't waste your time or money on this one..	neg
We LOVE this item!!!  We get older TV show DVDs from Netflix and they generally are not in the best condition when they come.  If the cleaner doesn't work, and it generally does, our back up is the repair stuff, which almost always does.  I think out of 30 disks, only two were not fixed. --- 	pos
This case looks good and protects the camera adequately, but is too bulky. It hasn't got a lot of room inside - I was unable to fit an extra SD card in its little case and a spare battery.

I poured it down the sink and it was yellow. I do not recommend buying this product and if you must have this scent please don't buy it with the atomizer. The lotion still smells good.	neg
The shirt fits well, good style, good shirt.  But Bealls of Florida sucks as a retailer.  Their customer service is rude, crude, and unrefined.

I never adjusted a watch band before and I thought it was going to be difficult after reading the other reviews on the other watch tools. This tool could not have made it any easier, I didn't break any pins and I adjusted two watch bands the night it arrived with ease. You will need a pair of needle nose pliers to pull the watch pin completely out of the band. I adjusted an Accutron Lady's York and a Swiss Army Men's Maverick. I used the tool to remove and replace the watch pins, just line the pins and squeeze the pliers slowly. The accutron used solid pins and the Swiss Army used pins that looked like they were screws but were pins that are cut or bent in half so always push from the end that looks like a screw head	pos
I just got this camera recently along with the printer. Setting up was very simple. The only problem I came across was putting the ribbon in the printer. You have to use your finger to remove the slack from the ribbon but it's not that easy. When you put the ribbon in the printer it gets caught on something and could damage the ribbon. It takes time and tons of patients to get that ribbon in the printer. The pictures come out very nice and print even better. I washed a couple of pictures to test the quality and they came out flawless. This camera is a value and shouldn't be passed up. The screen on the camera is huge and the buttons take some time to get use too. If you have any further questions feel free to comment them and I'll reply as possible	pos

Brando can sing!! --- Guys and Dolls is proof. One of the all time great musicals and the biggest box office hit of 1955, has Brando as the main lead and he is ably supported by THE VOICE - Sinatra. Now only a mad man will say that Brando is a better singer than Sinatra, but to give Brando his due he sang well and carried of the role brilliantly...like wise only a mad man will say Sinatra is a better actor than Brando. ---  --- Guys and Dolls is a very important film in Brando's career. It is the first light hearted movie he made. All his movies before this were heavy dramatic stuff. This is the first movie where Brando is having fun and what fun it was. ---  --- Great songs, great acting and great stars...GUYS and DOLLS is 4 star entertainment all the way. ---  --- Brando and Simmons along with Sinatra and Blaine are amazing. 	pos

I've been subscribing to Paste for over a year now, and it's a great magazine. I agree with what others have said about the writing: the interviewers often seem in love with their subjects and deal with the musicians as fans instead of as journalists. There are tons of reviews in each issue on a wide variety of bands and music, and the sampler CD and DVD are worth the subscription price all by themselves. It's a great way to listen to bands that you would never have heard otherwise. If you love music and are spending a small fortune on CDs, this magazine is for you. My only real criticism of the magazine is that it is very text heavy, with tons of small print jammed onto each page, often with a background picture/design behind the words, which makes it a chore to read. I would love to see larger print and less eye junk on the pages. Then again, I'm closing in on 40 so younger eyes may not find it as problematic	pos
I ordered one each for my 5-year-old daughter and her 2 friends for Valentine's Day.  Nice pearl color and oval-like shapes.  Slightly too big for a 5-year-old but would be good for older children or a small wristed adult. Very dainty.  A great buy for the price	pos

... for giving every dance studio and popular dance genre the hope that they too can be the "next Riverdance". The dancers are all talented, if self-consciously hip, and in great shape. But the numbers that focus more on T & A than fancy footowrk really did this show in for me. I love it when risks are taken with conventional dance forms, but ballroom dance is OTT enough ( if you've ever watched a competition) and doesn't need to be tarted up beyond recognition, the way it is here. Add the disjointed lighting and editing effects and what you have is a hot mess	neg

This is a compilation, but the original Incense and Peppermints album was really revolutinary for the time. I will date myself now, but I remember hearing this song on the radio in our car and was mesmerized by it. It was the first Lp I had ever bought. I actually wore out the groves on the Lp and came across another a few years ago. To this day, almost 40 years after I first heard the Strawberry Alarm Clock, I still like Incense and Peppermints as well as their other songs. Their style ranges from acid rock to jazz. The musicians are all very talented and the band works as a team as opposed to many of the bands of the era. Their recordings are really high quality and certainly not over processed like a lot of today's music is. SAC was in an era where 60's music was in transition from the early Beatles and old time R&R sound to a more acid rock sound. Lyrics like 'tune in, turn on, turn your eyes around.. look at yourself' were typical of SAC's lyrical style as well as the thinking of the times. It was an odd time. On one side, we had Woodstock, mini-skirts, muscle cars and fun fun fun, But, on the dark side, there were civil rights problems and the Viet Nam war. This transitional period was a kind of awakening for the country and for music. Although not as popular as names like the Doors, Jefferson Airplane and Steppenwolf, the Strawberry Alarm Clock still had a huge following. My only regret is that I didn't get a chance to see them (or the Doors!) when they came to the city where I lived during the late 60's. This album is a nice compilation of  SAC's hits. The songs are as fresh and original sounding as they were almost 40 years ago.	pos
This is a fine product. The 3 LED bulbs pack a vast amount of illumination. I ordered 4 of them and have no problem lighting up my whole livingroom. I left 1 unit on for over 6 hours and its was still burning brightly when I chose to shut it off. You will not be disappointed with these. Awsome	pos
I found these shoes by searching the women's option for running shoes.  The name may say Unisex, but there is no indication that the sizing is 100% male.  Not even a note stating that a woman should subtract 2 or 3 or 10 sizes from her normal shoe size.  ---  --- When the shoes arrived here, they were huge. I tried to return them, but Amazon considers this to be MY fault, and planned to charge back any shipping, promotions and coupons against a possible refund.  I had done very well using a coupon, a sale, a "buy $80 worth of shoes and get $20 off instantly" promotion and Amazon prime, so my "refund" would be less than nothing.  ---  --- That's right -- if I return the shoes, I owe money.  Because Amazon made no mention that shoes found in the women's section of the site might be men's shoes instead.  Yeah, that seems fair	neg

They changed pretty much everything. For starters they completely removed all of the normal menus such as File, Tool, and Edit. Which means you can't use the keyboard for quick and easy menu access. Well maybe you can, but you would have to memorize all of the commands instead of having the nice little visual cues which made previous versions of Office (and almost all other PC programs) so much easier to use. You basically have to use the mouse for everything. And in my experience there is no faster way to repetitive stress injury than over-mousing. ---  --- The Ribbon is just awful. First of all it's huge. It takes up about FOUR TIMES the space of my customized toolbar. They place nearly every button imaginable on it. And as far as I can tell you can't change it around or simplify it. Every function is displayed all the time whether you need it or not. Which makes finding anything a real pain in the neck. You can make the ribbon retract which at first glance seems nice. But in reality it turns what used to be simple 1-click operations into 3-click operations (extend ribbon, spend several minutes searching for button, click button, retract ribbon). Good grief! What a pain. ---  --- This software didn't last 24 hours on my system before I restored my old version of Office. This new interface is about the most awful thing I've ever seen on a computer. I know of certain free open source office suites that I prefer to this monstrosity. That being said I still prefer any and all previous versions of MS Office to the free one. In fact I would rather be using my old Wordperfect from 1995 than this *thing* that MS is trying to shove down our throats. If only I hadn't thrown that disc away six years ago... ---  --- Before you "invest" your money in this software I strongly recommend you download the free trial version. Then buy an earlier version	neg

This bigwheel is so poorly made.  You have to affix the pedals and they do not stay on.  We put duct tape around the rod that holds the pedals on so they would stay.

Following Orson Welles' fascinating yet tantalizing career can be frustrating for the aficionado.  So much of his oeuvre remains hidden from view that each discovery from the archives is greeted with an inordinate amount of enthusiasm.  Take this intriguing yet relatively disappointing collection of documentaries Welles directed for British TV in the 1950s. ---  --- "The missing link in Welles' work," exults the snapcase boilerplate.  This is a bit of an overstatement, given that far more significant works haven't seen the light of day ("Don Quixote" and "The Other Side of the Wind," to name a couple). The documentaries do help to fill the gap in Welles' output for the 1950s, a decade in which he directed only three feature films.  "Around the World" is a good quality DVD and unquestionably the work of Welles, but a ultimately a shadow of what he was capable of.  ---   --- The five episodes on this DVD explore various aspects of European Culture.  Welles takes his camera in search of Basque country, Spanish bullfights, the idiosyncratic denizens of Paris' St Germain des Pres, and the loquacious and venerable Chelsea Pensioners.  The "St Germain des Pres" episode best typifies the offbeat subject matter.  Welles spends most of his time interviewing a commune dweller who makes his own clothes.  After that, Welles dashes through the town, capturing glimpses of celebrities like Jean Cocteau and Eddie Constantine ("Lemmy Caution"), before discovering a group of "Letterists" who are dedicated to (you guessed it) inventing new letters.  ---  --- Unfortunately, Welles' typically low budget and the nature of the subject matter limit his range of cinematic expression.  Despite the exotic and obscure locales, most of the footage consists of relatively static interviews, captured in long takes with obligatory reaction shots of Welles inserted to break up the monotony.  Even the bullfight episode lacks the dynamic footage one might expect; Welles' camera is grounded in the stands, preventing him from getting involved in the action.  Only towards the end of "St. Germain des Pres" and in the second Basque episode does Welles get inventive, developing the active, swirling camera style he employed in films like "Mr. Arkadin."   ---  --- Like a record that's worth owning for one or two songs, "Around the World with Orson Welles" does have one episode that justifies its purchase: the second Basque episode.  True, the first few minutes repeat the introduction from the first Basque show, but after that Welles has a lot of fun interviewing kids playing 'pelote' (a game similar to jai alai).  Welles gets his camera into the pelote action, and seems rejuvenated by the subject matter. An 11-year old boy joins Welles and acts as a tour guide for the rest of the show.  The episode ends dramatically, with Welles quoting a Basque aphorism against a night sky lit by fireworks.  ---   --- For a better example of Welles' creativity in the documentary genre, check out his 1974 essay film, "F for Fake," just released on DVD.  "Around the World with Orson Welles" is a far more pedestrian effort, but it does give Welles fans something to look at while they await the more significant releases that are hopefully on the not-too-distant horizon	neg

Based upon reviews, I decided to go with Dr. Brown's from the start. We've been very happy with them! A friend had given me some Avent bottles she had never used so I decided to try them & compare. My baby had a terrible tummy ache & had never before burped so much. Those Avents now sit in the back of the cabinet gathering dust. ---  --- For folks who complain about leakage....the rare times that has happened to me was when I accidentally added milk past the top marker. Otherwise, I've never had a single problem with any sort of leakage. ---  --- Another plus is that they're very easy to clean; I just pop all the pieces into the top rack of the dishwasher (I use a toddler basket to hold some of the smaller pieces).  ---  --- If you're comparing the wide mouth to the standard, forget the standard! They're a pain to get liquid into (but still good bottles). ---  --- I absolutely love this product & would never consider another bottle	pos
Our very busy toddler (17 months old) is having a good time with this scooter.  It is very well made especially for the reasonable price.  The wheels do not scratch our wood floors, unlike some of her other toys.  She is our third and we have had our fair share of similar toys.  This one is one of the better ones.  The only down side is that it could be a little lower to the ground.  She is above average height and can just reach the floor well enough to push with her feet.  Our older girls were petitie and this would have been too big for them at the recommended age of 18 months.  Once they are in their twos, our girls have preferred trikes, so I'm also not sure how long this will last as a 'favorite', but it can definately be 'handed -down' or given to friends as it is going to last for years	pos

Long story short.  Bought for daughter for Christmas...it is in the trash...This was THE WORST TOY/DOLL purchase ever	neg
Wow, this l932 camp classic squeezes so much into its running time--S&M, near-nudity, drugs, racism,sex, sex--you're left gasping. Boris Karloff turns in a delightful turn as the menacing Fu Manchu. Myrna  Loy, in her pre-superstar days, is his "horribly ugly" daughter,  who delights in capturing gorgeous hunk, Charles Starrett, and playing with  him like a toy. His nearly nude scenes--when he wears a loose, constantly  shifting diaper--while she runs her long talons over her glistening  torso--must've have accelerated pulses of all sexes back in this pre-Code  extravaganza. Fay Wray should have played Karen Morley's squealing heroine.  Silver-haired and elegant Lewis Stone makes an off-beat hero-adventurer.  Gorgeous photography by Tony Gaudio, comic book costumes by Adrian, art  deco settings by Cedric Gibbons make this a smash-hit from the first frame  to the last. Lots of flesh baring by Charles and the dark slaves. It's fun  to watch Myrna lash her whip over Starrett and her "Nubian"  slaves. Great quote: "Will we ever understand this Eastern race?&quot	pos
The IS-DV only records videos in the 'ASF' format, not MPEG-4.  I bought one from 'egghead.com'.  After 30 days, I contacted Aiptek to tell them the problem, they acknowledged that the IS-DV only records videos in the 'ASF' format.  They said there is nothing they will do about it.  Do not buy this product.  Aiptek advertises that the IS-DV records video in MPEG-4 format, but it doesn't.  'Egghead.com' won't deal with me because they say I should deal with the manufacture after 30 days from the purchase date	neg
I have this program on a 30-day demo.  It might be OK if I didn't mind my computer becoming almost unusable. ---  --- I tried to run the system virus scan, as recommended, but after 3 hours it was only 2% done because it was stuck on a file it couldn't seem to get past.  I skipped the file, but then it quickly got stuck again.  The "time remaining" said it would take 4 days to complete, so I cancelled that scan. ---  --- It has a learning mode that initally blocks EVERYTHING.  Apparently, this program has no brain.  For example, I have the Live Search Toolbar installed in Outlook.  It had to ask me if it was OK to run that dll file.  In fact, each program that called up a process from a shared dll has to ask permission before it could run. ---  --- Don't even get me started on the Quickbooks and Internet Explorer problems.  Which is what it wouldn't let those programs do, even after they had been run and I repeated clicked "allow" over and over. ---  --- Twice today it got so slow running IE that it finally crashed the computer so bad that  I had to do a hard re-boot.  If you have it checking ports on your computer, almost nothing would run or download on IE. ---  --- So, I'm going to demo a few more, but it's probably back to Windows Live OneCare, which I had the past year.  It just doesn't seem to do much (no long list of features), but it also doesn't jam everthing else up	neg
For less than $200 this is a great camera.  It is by no means spectacular, but for the price, it does a good job.  I own a Canon Powershot S60 as well, and the Canon outdoes this camera in some ways, but it's not pocketable.  The F20 is easy to use, the menu interface is fairly simple and self-descriptive, it powers up and is ready to take a picture quickly, and shutter lag seems average (close to the S60).  However, the only way to eliminate shutter lag is to buy a DSLR.  The "anti-shake" mechanism is not really useful at all, it merely boosts the ISO to 2000 which makes the image unprintable (at least indoors).  I have yet to try it this feature outside.  I've also found that dialing down the exposure compensation helps with the lowlights, especially outdoors.  Manually setting the ISO from 100-400 will, I hope, make for more printable, usable pictures.  I had actually thought of returning this little camera, but then realized that I could find nothing, for the price, that would be able to compete. I really wanted a 28mm lens, only found on more expensive models like the Canon sd800is, or Lumix's (which apparently have tons of noise at low ISO's).   It's pocketable, portable, and with a little tinkering you can get what you want from it. 	pos

You get a view into 60's white america. The only people of color in this book are a policeman, and a caricature. I don't have a problem with other Seuss books where they are set in fantasy land and the whole world is make believe. This is set in everyday life, and I think its best left on the bookshelf, it has nothing to offer my child who has and who lives in a world where folks have brown eyes and black hair, not to mention various shades of skin colour. The rhyming is also not entertaining enough to enjoy and makeup for this one-dimensional "white" depiction of the world	neg
The very first DVD player I bought was Sony's very first 5 Disc DVD changer back in 1998. It was an excellent player, but as the technology improved, it could no longer keep up. I upgraded to a single disc Sony which could handle DTS, and later to another single disc player which could handle progressive video. But I always missed the convenience of a 5 disc changer after having been spoiled by one at the start. At about one-third the price of that original DVD changer, this player has all the features of those previous upgrades and more while retaining the familiar functionality of my first player. It produces an excellent picture, has lots of tweakable settings, has more outputs, and is also very stylish looking. ---  --- I do have a couple of nits, though. My original DVD changer had buttons on the remote which allowed me to jump directly to whichever disc I wanted. With this one, I have to press a Disc Skip button to cycle through all the discs until I reach the one I want. The front of the player does have direct access buttons, though. I wish I still had my old remote control as I'm sure it would work with this unit to restore that remote functionality. ---  --- Second, the upscaling through HDMI produces a great image, but not really any better than leaving the image at 720x480p. In fact, upscaling will sometimes magnify some interlacing artifacts visible in the picture. It's also unfortunate that while connected through HDMI, progressive scan cannot be turned off. This shouldn't be an issue most of the time, but there are some video sources that might look better with it turned off. Progressive settings can only be changed on the unit itself and not through the remote, but they cannot be turned off when connected through HDMI.  ---  --- One last thing about the HDMI connection. There can sometimes be a noticeable audio sync issue when using HDMI connections and digital TVs. This is not a problem with the player, but with the way HDMI is currently implemented. This player has an audio-sync adjustment feature which should compensate for the problem. However, the audio-sync adjustment doesn't work if the player is connected to a receiver via its optical digital outputs. Since I need to have mine connected this way in order to enjoy 5.1 sound, the audio-sync adjustment feature is useless here. And that's a shame. By the way, there should be no audio-sync issues if the player is connected via component, s-video, or composite outputs. ---  --- There's also a minor thing I've found about all my Sony DVD players that I haven't liked. They are unable to correctly display Time Remaining on certain discs, or more commonly on the special features (documentaries, etc.) on certain discs. I also have a cheapo Philips player which has no problems displaying Time Remaining on those things (even on the menu). It's an improvement I'd really like to see implemented on future players. ---  --- Now, despite the complaints I've listed above, don't get me wrong. This is still an excellent player and I really love it. I happily recommend it to anyone considering purchasing it. It really is a great value and it performs very well in most instances, and I feel it's the best DVD player I've ever owned. It's just not quite perfect. In all likelihood, it's also the last DVD player I'll ever own as I'll probably be buying a BluRay or other HD player in a couple of years when that format war is over. But this is a great player to hold me over until then	pos

For $99 this should be a much better remote.  If you watch movies in the dark, you have to use the glow button, guess what, you will have to replace the batteries once a month at least.  Also, Logitech has over simplifed the remote.  You can't program individual buttons you have to use their program that only allows you to program devices and not the remote directly.  If you have to go into the device menu  a lot you will not be able to control the volume unless you switch to the device that controls volume.  Why not have an option to program each button period...  But the remote is useless now because of the low battery life.  Do not buy this unless you want to buy batteries every month.  Ridiculous.  Only remote I have ever had like this	neg

Leave it to me to start into a series in its' second, third, or fourth installments. In this case, it's the fourth. Course, there's a good explanation why. I set out looking for Final Fantasy I&II: Dawn of Souls for my Gameboy Advance(Hey, if you're going to collect a series, it's a good thing to start at the beginning) at my local videogame store but they only had Final Fantasy IV Advance so I decided to get it instead. There isn't much that I can say that hasn't already been said by the other reviewers here about Final Fantasy IV Advance.The story goes like this..The kingdom of Baron is on a quest to collect all the elemental crystals. The commander of its air force, Cecil, has been dismissed after questioning the king's motives. With the help of others; Cecil sets out to stop the growing threat and, in the meantime, uncovers a far more dangerous one. It's a deep story with alot of twists and turns & is a deeply challenging game due to the Active Time Battle system. I can't recommend this game enough. It's one of my all-time favorite Final Fantasy games.  ---  --- Although they tweaked the graphics, translation and whatnot abit, they pretty much made the game as it was originally. I think Final Fantasy fans as well as casual RPG gamers will really enjoy this one.	pos

With King Creole, Love Me Tender and Stay Away Joe - JAILHOUSE ROCK 1957 is Elvis Presley at his best. He declined the old musical tradition of MGM and insisted on a contemparary look - especially how the choreography should be executed. ---  --- In this film we see ELVIS PRESLEY at his very best. He was a stunning actor - much more prefer HIM to James Dean...  It`s a shame he made more or less 33 forgettable films.... only a handful stands out and JAILHOUSE ROCK is the best.  It isn`t a classic - it isn`t even great. But we have ELVIS - the KING - and that`s the best there is:-))	pos

Given high acclaims this film has collected over time, I was glad to pick up a VHS copy at my local library sale.  Began to watch it last night.  I was able to sit thru the part 1.  When the tape ended, I was actually glad. I felt a sense of acomplishment in finishing the part 1!  The movie is DREARY to the max.  People portrayed are irrational, lost, uncommunicative, and subject to random and cruel violence by soldiers and rulers.  In some way, this movie reminded me of the dreary winter (lasting 6 months!) I spent in Russia a couple of years ago...  ---  --- To me, the movie reflects the psychological breakdown that happened after the decades long terror policy of Soviet state (1920-1956).  For survivors, nothing made any sense anymore, except perhaps fear and evil, as people in this dreary film reflects.  People have been already destroyed in their souls.  They are psychologically shattered beyond repair and only occasional readings of the Bible verses give them any sense of permanence in their chaotic daily experience.  ---  --- Maybe that is the real meaning of this movie.  To really reflect what happened to people's psyche after Lenin and Stalin's UNLIMITED TERROR, they found a parallel in Mongol's devastation and oppression of medieval Russia.  In both cases, people were left shattered, helpless, irrational, withdrawn,  and autistic.  	neg
It is very difficult to attach it to anything. The straps are to short and under strange angel. My son did not play with it	neg
I think that this crib toy is awesome! Since my son was 3 months old we've turned it on every night at bedtime for him. He just watches the fishies swim around while the lights dance and the music plays. My son is now 7 months old and he still seems to like it.  And the cool thing is that now he is old enough to be able to interact with it.  If I switch it to manual MODE, he can turn on the music himself!  He can also play with the crackling feet and feel the silky material. Plus, he has another friend to keep him company in his crib (a big happy turtle with fish in his belly :-). Thus far, the straps haven't broken or cracked and I have removed it from the crib a couple of times. Also, the fish do swim around and the music does last for 15 minutes.  Its just a matter of which MODE you switch it to. (Reading the instructions really helps.) I strongly recommend this	pos

I notice several other reviews mentioning faulty/defective consoles arriving. Well, I received my first Schwinn 438 about a month ago. I put it all together, and realized they did not ship an AC adapter with the machine. I contacted Amazon, they told me to either send the machine back for another or contact the manufacturer. I contacted the manufacturer on Saturday, they were closed. I contacted them the following Monday and they told me the item was on back order, but, I could buy a compatible adapter from Radio Shack. I did. I came home excited to use my elliptical, unfortunately, the console did nothing but beep at me..very frustrating. I contacted the manufacturer again, they advised me that the console was on backorder and would not be delivered for at least 2 months. They recommended I send the unit back to Amazon for a replacement. I did so. I spent the better part of a night taking the thing apart and repackaging it...quite a job trying to squeeze it back in the box. About 3 weeks later, I received my second elliptical. Same faulty console problem, after spending another couple of hours putting the thing together. Contacted Amazon and demanded a full refund and return. They did pick the unit up, and did not make me take it all apart this time, but, I am still awaiting a full refund. I have since purchased a Vision Fitness elliptical from a real fitness shop in my area. I am extremely happy with the unit, although it was a few hundred bucks more. This was one horrific experience with Amazon. I wouldn't recommend buying this product, seems like they are shipping out defective units	neg

So I decided maybe I'll give this exploitation thing a try considering I love gore,violence, and horror movies. The reason I give it a 1 star is because it just isn't that good of a movie. It's VERY boring for most of the movie. About the first 20 or so minutes few words are even said. Then the guys just rape this woman several times, then she comes back for a very unsatisfying revenge. It's very slow paced and doesn't live up to the hype. It isn't all that gory, and it isn't scary either. Also, the rape isn't that convincing. I'm not saying I need everything shown in detail, but the acting is so bad it makes it seem as if its not even a big deal. Oh, and the woman gets revenge on one of the men who raped her...and he was practically mentally retarded. The guy really just fell in with the wrong crowd and they convinced him to do something bad. That is not grounds for what she did to him, which in my opinion was the worst of the killings. Anyways. not that good of a movie, don't let the lure of sleaze and violence make you think it will be worth your time because its not	neg

I am a huge Special K fan. Especially Red Berry, but at heart I am a chocoholic. I was so excited to hear they had a chocolate version and I ran right out to try it.

This commentary has many tremendous insights into the book of Romans.  Romans is one of the richest resources of truth within the Bible and John Stoot does a good job of unpacking it.

One of the best-directed films of 2006, "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" is built for multiple viewings and perhaps for cult audiences.   ---  --- And even though "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" may require multiple viewings just to catch all of the rapid-fire dialogue, or to untangle the plot, one of the best reasons for multiple viewings is to admire the directorial skill:  It's a Class-A tutorial for amateur filmmakers or simply armchair film-buffs who will appreciate the highwire juggling act that Shane Black pulls off here, with "KKBB"'s sudden shifts of tone from slapstick to dead-serious drama to gallows-comedy. ---  --- If that seems like an easy feat, well... Remember "1941"?  Not even Spielberg got it right.  But Shane Black nails it here -- and it's his directorial debut. ---  --- Downey & Kilmer are also at the top of their game here, but it's Michelle Monaghan who impresses with a flat-out great performance that keeps up with the veterans. ---  --- "Sui Generis" (one-of-a-kind) is the phrase that best describes "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang," although it's remarkably mainstream at times.  It's a showcase of talents for everyone involved, and when the bullets aren't flying, there's even a romantic comedy here & social commentary to boot.  I can't think of any other film quite like it -- and that's just how the Warner Brothers tradition seems to work (at its best). --- 	pos

I have an Amazon bookmark that advertises Ludlum's book "The Sigma Protocol". It says "In Ludlum's latest, an ordinary man battles a global conspiracy." Well gee. That's the plot of THIS book as well. Come to think of it, that's the plot of every book by the man that I've read. A 'vast right wing conspiracy' is set to take over the world. They have small armies, a lot of money and a plan. This time around, a group of military men (naturally) plan to foment terror, and use the chaos to implement their vision of the world (laugh not - millions in the Middle East and far Left believe 9-11 was something along the same lines). Enter "ordinary man" Joel Converse. He's a Vietnam vet and P.O,W. who thought he had left that life far behind. It's up to him to save the world. He will survive certain death several times (the bad guys always seem to think they need him alive, and they just HAVE to explain their conspiracy to this total stranger). He will find love, and he'll visit several European cities to boot. Of course, a suspension of disbelief is essential for many novels (how else would you believe that a Nazi and an Israeli are on the same side?), but Ludlum's cliched stories are further worsened by the fact that he just couldn't write. His dialogue writing is always tedious, and sometimes just painful to read. Action scenes are generic. The only thing he could do right is character background, but that's not enough to save this. "The Aquitaine Progression" might make a half decent TV movie, but to endure 700 pages is just too much	neg
Works great out of the box. Some reviews mentioned problems with the CD but mine worked fine but took some time to start on the first try.  It mounted easly under the upper kitchen cabinet.

I have 3 Danelectro Fab effects pedals. The sound I get from this overdrive pedal is much more than I thought I'd get for my starter collection. A couple, more expensive effects I purchased, made by another brand, don't seem to be any better than the Danelectro Fab. ---  --- The casing is a heavy duty plastic, not metal so I'm not sure how well it would hold up to stage use or someone with a heavy foot.  ---  --- As for the comment about this pedal being a waste of time by another reviewer, most guitarists already know that they need to purchase an AC adaptor for a power source. Consider it a learning experience. Once you buy the adapter be sure to pick up a multi-plug cable if you want more than one effects pedal. This allows you to hook up several more plugs to the one AC adaptor. I now have 5 effects pedals hooked up to one energy source. Bought mine at The Guitar Center so I don't know if Amazon carries them. ---  --- Radio waves are everywhere and travel great distances depending on the tower they come from.

Things seem to be going fine, until the two men begin to fall in love with eachothers leading lady!  --- The movie has GREAT Porter songs De Lovely, Anything Goes, Second Hand Turban, Blow Gabe Blow, I get a kick out of you, You're the Top, and a fabulous tap number with Donald: You Can Bounce Right Back. Phil Harris also stars in this fantastic, De Lovely movie!!	pos
I ordered this bike for my granddaughters 4th birthday.  The first shipment arrived on schedule, but the box was total destroyed and without opening you could see that the bike was scratched and dented.  Delivery was refused and another bike was sent.  The 2nd bike arrived, with the box being in less than perfect condition, but delivery was accepted.  When my son started assembling the bike, he found that several of the parts had been assembled at the factory incorrectly and he could not assemble the bike.  The bike was returned for a credit and we went and purchased a similar bike locally.  We still have not received a credit for the return of the bike.  I am very disappointed and will not purchase from this vendor again	neg
Unfortunately, for all the name brand that this book conveys, I think the cover seems to be the most intriguing part.  There are much better ways for book peddling and the fact that a firm such as McKinsey allowed their name on the title of a book for the sake of a few sales, boggles this readers mind.  The subject matter seems to be along the lines of the bull session with all bull and no session.  No actual quantitative analysis is used throughout the book, and if anything more than an encyclopedic definition is learned from this book, I would be astounded.  Save some money and go search online for some basic books on beginning valuation.  By the way, those giving 5 stars either can't read English very well or are shills for McKinsey	neg
I bought some of this for my husband last Christmas with a stovetop popcorn popper (the kind with the stir rod.)  Now it's our favorite brand of popcorn and our favorite way to make it.  The packages come with pre-measured oil & popping corn and you just cook it all up.  Each box has 5 bags.  Each bag makes a big bowl (?20 cups?)  We only have to add salt and we love the taste.  I highly recommend this with a stir rod popper, too--either the stovetop or electric kind. 	pos
I caught some of this on PBS and was beyond appalled that they chose to cast Reba McEntire as Nellie.  Musicals are for people that can sing, not whine and slide their way up to the preferred pitch.  I'm a native of Arkansas, by the way, and it hurts my ears to listen to Reba's voice.  Reba's country treatment of the vocals shows exactly how talentless she is	neg
This is a great cot.  It is low profile, and made of strong materials.  I was worried about the wire legs, but they are very, very strong.  So strong that it takes some muscle to get them into their holes in the frame.  This might be a drawback for someone who is weak in the arms.  It folds up easy and is very portable.  Also, I have a smaller frame, and although this cot is perfect for me, a larger frame person might want to consider a wider version for comfort in the shoulder area.  You won't be disappointed in this one for the money	pos

My title says it all - I was really disappointed with this camera, but before I get into the specifics as to why, I must mention a few things first.  This was my third camera in the Exilim line - prior to purchasing Z850 I have owned Z60, as well as Z600.  Both were great cameras.  I mean, what's not to like?  Clean, sexy look; easy to use; great picture quality.  But having to work for Kodak in the past, I decided that I want to get more involved with the world of digital photography and post processing, and in order to do that I needed something with a little more manual control, so I sold my Z600, and got a Z850 instead.  Big mistake!  I ordered it directly from Amazon, and it was a brand new camera.  Right of the bat I got a defective unit!  The problem - it was very inconsistent at taking sharp pictures, especially close-ups.  The shots were blurry for the most part, and the colors were a bit off as well.  How is that for quality and reliability?!  But I thought to myself, "it's okay, it happens", so I returned it back to Amazon (thanks to their great return policy), and got myself another one, this time from TechToysForLess (it was a lot cheaper comparing to Amazon).  One thing to be aware of - TechToysForLess sells what it's called "grey market" cameras.  I knew about it ahead of time, but someone might not, and then be unpleasantly surprised.  For those who don't know what it is - the "grey market" refers to the flow of new goods through distribution channels other than those authorized or intended by the manufacturer.  Only new products fall under the legal, accepted definition of grey market.  Grey market goods are being sold outside of normal distribution channels by companies which may have no relationship with the producer of the goods.  Frequently this form of parallel import occurs when the price of an item is significantly higher in one country than another. This situation commonly occurs with cigarettes and electronic equipment, such as cameras.   Entrepreneurs buy the product where it is available cheaply, often at retail but sometimes at wholesale, import it legally to the target market and sell it at a price which provides a profit but which is below the normal market price there.  So, the product is legal, it's new, and it's cheap.  BUT... In some instances, there could be minor differences between the "authorized" product, and the "grey market" one.  For example, a "grey" Z850 doesn't have an eBay mode, but offers an "Auction" mode instead.  It's a bit different with respect to settings.  Also, there is no full blown manual in the box, but rather a short "how to" instruction in various languages.  However, the full manual can be found on a CD-ROM.  Another difference, and that's actually a plus I think, is that it comes with a European power adapter, whereas American sold models don't have that.  The biggest concern with "grey market" products, however, is that in some cases manufacturer will refuse to honor the warranty, so you have to be aware of that, and check before buying.  I knew all of the above, but still took a chance, mainly because the price difference was significant, but also because TechToysForLess had a 10-day return policy, and I thought that it would be enough time for me to "explore" the camera and find out whether it's defective or not.  In any case, I placed an order, and three days later held a new Z850 in my hands.  I didn't waste any time, and when the battery was fully charged, I started taking shots left and right.  All of them were crisp, clear, and sharp, so I knew the unit was good, and the lens wasn't defective as it was with the previous one I had.  However, and I noticed it right away because I tend to take mostly pictures of people, the colors were a bit "warm".  What I mean is there was a slight cast of "pink" present in all pictures.  You wouldn't notice it in pictures of architecture, food, or nature, but people's skin tone looked somewhat unnatural, and it was very obvious.  Neither Z60, nor Z600 had that problem.  I still kept the camera though because I could take care of it by doing some minor editing/post processing.  What finally made me gave it up (I sold it on eBay), was the Casio's ignorance and unresponsiveness to the fact that it had a "broken" movie mode.  The original firmware, version 1.0, that the camera came with had a problem with "stair stepping" - the movies were "jerky", and "noisy".  After numerous complaints by the customers, Casio released two new firmware versions, 1.1, and 1.1B that supposedly "fixed" the movie issue.  But what they in fact did was just "cripple" it - the movie angle was cut by 40% in version 1.1B, and the picture quality actually got worse!  Version 1.1 didn't actually fix anything, but rather "improved" already decent picture quality, and added support for high capacity memory cards.  Also, I've heard from a lot of people that even if those cameras function properly in the beginning, there is a big chance that they will brake later due to poor quality.  I didn't want to wait to find out, so I got rid off it. ---  --- I didn't do my usual Pros and Cons type of review in this case, and from above comments it might seem like there is nothing positive about this camera, but it actually does have a few good things.  For one, in addition to its big, super-bright display, it has a viewfinder!  A big plus in my opinion, especially when shooting outdoors in direct sunshine.  Also, on top of its numerous preprogrammed  Best Shots, it has some manual controls, giving you even more flexibility.  It's a nice little camera.  Unfortunately, it lacks in two important departments - quality and reliability.  I wish I could say that I enjoyed using it, but it was more of a hassle than fun. ---  --- However, I still stand behind Casio products.  After I sold Z850, I got myself a P700 model, which has been discontinued for some time now, and is virtually impossible to find anywhere.  It's a semi-pro model, and offers even more manual controls than Z750/Z850 models.  Excellent camera!  A true performer!  Built like a tank, has a sharp Canon lens, and made in Japan for a change! (all other Exilim models are made in China, which could be the reason for poor quality)  I've used P700 for a couple of months, and... sold it :-)  Yep... Call me crazy, call me whatever you want - I just decided that I want even MORE manual control and flexibility, so I got myself Panasonic DMC-LX2.  One word - Wow!  What a camera!  Optical Image Stabilization, Wide Angle Leica Lens, RAW format are just to name a few of many features of this truly great little gem of a camera.  I've had it only for 2 days now, but I'm already in love with it.  Don't forget to check my review of it, which is coming shortly.  I didn't completely abandon Casio's though - my present to my wife for Valentine's Day this year - Casio EX-S770 in Red color.  I'm definitely going to get my hands on it also, so come back for another review soon.  Once again, I hope I've provided you with some help in your camera purchasing decisions.  Good luck	neg

This is a good holster for my V220. It doesnt hang up on me as much as the erson who last reviewed it did. For a holster i give it 4 stars because its function is to hold the cell phone in place on your belt. One problem i have with it is that it holds the phone down by where the strap should be, so having a strap on it wouldnt work too well. and also because it holds it where the strap is, it adds a little wear to that area. Other than that its a good holster for the price. And thats another one of my problems. I paid 14 dollars for this at my local mall, which was highly over priced for my standards. Amazon seems like a great place to buy it, but if you search for Motorola V220 Phone Accessories, then you can find a site with free shipping for it, and its 7 bucks. Theres also another site that has it for 3 bucks, but with shipping. I trust amazons shipping though. So if you want a functional holster, get this one	pos
These work great initially...I bought six of them. Of the six, four broke. One stopped altogether, one stopped oscillating, and the other 2 would only work on 1 speed. I bought them in May and they broke after 2, 3, and 4 months, respectively. They are expensive fans, and I was extremely disappointed in their lack of durability. They were used at night by adults and were not moved around at all.  I have had a floor fan for 15 years and it still works without a hitch. These are cheaply put together and your money would be better spent on a fan with a better warranty (this is 1 year)and higher quality components.	neg
I tried $50-$60 sets from Regent (who apparently also does Spalding), Franklin, and Sportcraft, and only got a usable set by combining parts from 2 sets (alternately, one should check out manufacturer part replacement policies in advance, including who pays Shipping costs).  Regent and Sportcraft had several handles with too few threads, inviting breakage. Franklin wood and threads were such that 1 mallet's threads stripped when tightening by hand, and 1 had poor threads because the wood narrowed and flattened.  Some Sportcraft end caps rolled under, and they claimed their 2 ¾" balls were 3" (if they were rounding, why don't they round their 3 5/16" balls as well?).   Franklin's stakes had different tapers, and about 1/16" different diameters.  On the personal preference front, Sportscraft's handles are grooved, Franklin's balls are, and their wickets are narrow.  Regent's colors are dull	neg

I've been consistently impressed by the Bionicle toys from Lego, and the Rahkshi are no exception.  Wish I was young enough to actually play with this stuff.  Sigh.  Anyway, Rahkshi take the Bionicle can-sold figures to new a new level of articulation.  In total, joints are found at the neck, shoulder, wrist, hip, knee, and ankle, and the crank on the back swivels the entire arm assembly from side to side so you can whack things with the staff-like weapon each of the Rahkshi weilds.  Then there's  the opening case on the back so you can flip spooky little rubber leech/slug things through the air.  Each one of these things appears to come with a miniature CD full of Quicktime promotional stuff for the toys, game, web site, etc.  The voice is a bit melodramatic, but it's still kind of neat.  I like the 360-degree rotating model of the toy you just bought...sort of redundant, since you can look at the one in real life, but nifty all the same.  One thing that mildly disappointed me is that the Rahkshi's weapon isn't really an independanly existing object - which is to say that the bar held between the "hands" is only attached to the hands, not the heads of the weapon.  This isn't a really big deal, except that it means you can't have the figure hold the weapon in only one hand.  This could be rectified with 2 small technic pieces, of course, but it does mean you'd have to add extra bits to the set from somewhere else.  Overall, a very cool build-it-yourself action figure that could either be set to stand looming on your monitor at work, or actually played with.  Educational value is limited to following instructions and demonstration of structural principles, as in any Lego set.  Durability seems good so far - Lego is pretty sturdy stuff	pos

As other reviewers mentioned, the display does not update when using the bleed valve and you have to wait at least 10 seconds between readings.

This is perhaps my favorite Photography magazine. The printing is fantastic as is the subject matter. I really like the fact there are no ads in it at all.

This toys purpose is to sort your change, and it performs poorly. In mine, the quarters get stuck unless you pour coins in one by one, which takes forever.

I purchased this and spent 3 days on the phone with Hewlett Packard trying to get the correct adapter so it would fit my R818 camera (the dock has a thin port, roughly 10 connectors) while the R818 has a mini USB plug). ---  --- HP was less than helpful when it came to trying to get the correct adapter, getting a different answer each time I spoke to a different rep (even being told at one point that no supervisors were working).  I was finally able to get someone willing to send me one, but said it was going to be 10+ business days to get it, which by then I'll be on vacation (and I purchased it well in advance giving myself time to get the adapter, thinking it was not hard to get).  I was looking forwared to using the dock on my vacation. ---  --- I would definately *not* recommend this if you have the Photosmart R818 digital camera, unless you like the stress of spending hours on the phone with Hewlett Packard trying to get a correct part, and waiting 10+ business days to get it	neg
A woman that is passionate about beautiful things writes this review.  I am an avid do-it-yourselfer and love to do things around the house.   This magazine has been one of my favorites for years.  I look forward to each new issue and the decorating ideas that it will provide. ---  --- This magazine concentrates on upscale decorating, architecture and landscapes.  Many of the articles feature European country looks.  The photographs in this magazine are absolutely beautiful.    ---  --- The July / August 2006 edition contained the following: ---  --- 1. Venetian Villa (Adrienne Vittadini in Sarasota Florida) --- 2. Nantucket Renewal (Enlarging a Classic Cottage) --- 3. Blooming Intensity (Saturated with Color) --- 4. Coastal Hues (Seaside Radiance Captured) --- 5. British Accent (This side of the Pond) --- 6. The Art of Dining --- 7. The View from Veranda (Summer Place) --- 8. Tableaux (Staged Elegance) --- 9. Personal Luxury (Cool Coral) --- 10. On Exhibit (Jungles in Paris) --- 11. Trade Secrets (Summertime:  Fabrics, Rugs, Lighting) --- 12. Passions (Birds of Paradise: Home Aviary Design) --- 13. Showcase (Summer Seating:  For Pool and Porch) --- 14.  Verdant Paths (Annevoie:  Belgium's Water Garden) --- 15. The Last Word (Vanity Flair:  Adrienne Vittadini Sketchbook) ---  --- There are many photographs of this magazine of both house interiors and exteriors that I find to be very inspirational from a decorating perspective.  If you are looking for either painting or decorating ideas this magazine has much to offer.  I have replicated some of the interiors in my own home.   ---  --- The exterior photographs of this magazine are always very appealing.  I have been slowing changing the landscaping on my property to reflect a more Italian way of life.  I think you will be inspired to create an alfresco dining space after you have seen some of the beautiful landscape photographs. ---  --- The merchants that advertise in this magazine are fabulous.  I have purchased many items from them and have always been happy with my purchases. ---  --- I highly recommend this magazine to anyone that loves interior design, or just likes nice things.  This magazine is top notch all the way.	pos

I don't know how this skunk got 4 and 1/2 stars on Amazon let alone one!  I could hear Hepburn, Bogart and Holden rolling over with a resounding boom.  I think this is mainly because of Ford's Linus.  He is a very unsympathetic character in this remake.  The film critics said that, while the original Sabrina was about her transformation, this version was about Linus' transformation.  But here Linus shows no transformation that you can really see.  His explanation to Sabrina for his deceitful romancing at the end- "There was a merger, and you were in the way.  No hard feelings" is very cold compared with Bogart's "Would you believe I enjoyed every minute of it?"  In the original, you get the feeling that Sabrina gets the right man; you don't get that here at all	neg

I love Cheetos! ---  --- Did you have any idea you could review Cheetos on Amazon.com?  I admit I had no idea.  I typed it as a goof and up the page came. --- But I stand by my 5 star review. ---  --- Full of yummy MSG.  Do you know how MSG works?  It dilates your taste buds so all the flavors seem more intense.  It actually has no taste of its own.  Did you know? ---  --- When my mother was pregnant with me, she would wake up in the middle of the night and ask my father to go out and buy cheetos.  I don't know why.  Maybe the salty goodness. ---  --- If cheetos cost as much as truffles, they would be a considered a delicacy and served at the finest restaurants.  I wonder if you can buy truffles on Amazon.com.  Shall we check?  See you there	pos
I bought this for my daughter while I was still pregnant, thinking that it would be helpful thru the first few months (as well as later) in terms of being able to keep up with my daily chores and my 2 1/2 y.o. son. It certainly wasn't cheap, so I assumed that it would be a good product, and appeared to be safe and comfortable for younger infants. Don't let the product description fool you! Just as it says in some of the other reviews, it is very possible for your child to fall when in this sling, because of it's crappy strap tightener. My daughter was a small newborn, only weighing 8lbs at nearly 2 months, which was the first time I tried using the sling. And even being that small, for the 2 minutes I had the sling on I could already tell that the strap was starting to loosen. (Definitely NOT safe!) Aside from that, this item is so big and bulky that I literally could not even see my daughter in it. I might as well have just put a duffel bag over my shoulder and plopped her into it. There wouldn't have been much difference between the two. I WOULD STRONGLY ADVISE THAT YOU DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT! I want to get rid of mine, since it's brand new, but I threw away the box so I can't return it. And I absolutely cannot, in good concience, sell it to anyone else for their child. So, I have no choice but to just bite my tongue and throw the product in the trash. Don't make the same mistake I did!	neg
I enjoy all three of the the Jurassic Park movies, though I think "The Lost World" is a bit weak.  While I think that anyone who enjoys action movies, monster movies, or horror movies should own all three, I find it difficult to recommend this set because there is a set that contains not only the three movies, but a fourth DVD containing substantial background information on the making of the movies.  I give this collection four stars only because the larger, more comprehensive collection is available and if you liked the first two, you will definitely like the third movie	pos
I had seen this film a number of times either on T.V. or by me popping it in on my DVD player. Denzel Washington and Sarita Choudhury are a pleasure to watch in this engaging story about a love affair between a  Africa American male and an Indian woman, whom both has never been to there native land, and how their romance causes strife in a small Southern town.  The movie handles the reactions by both families to the interracial union of Mina and Demetrius. Against all this, a subplot in the story revolves around the loss of a homeland and friendship between Choudhury's proud Ugandan national father and the Black Ugandan friend he left behind during Idi Amin's reign of terror.  --- There are very few movies that can capture the emotions that go along with such a sensitive and controversial matter. Most importantly the opinions, thoughts, and traditions, both negative and positive, of both the Indian and Black communities are fairly communicated through the movie. A must see film and the only one I'm aware of that explores the relationship between African Americans and ethnic Indians.	pos
The Last American Virgin was literally one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and that's saying a lot. It's not a surprise no one from this film went on to any sort of stardom. The writing was terrible, the acting was terrible, the direction was terrible, the pacing was terrible, the jokes were god-awful, etc. Even the girls weren't really that attractive (with the huge '80s hair and bad fashion)! I mean, what the hell was that fat, ugly, dorky girl with the glasses doing in this movie, and, even more perplexing, why was our "hero" trying to lay her?? And why was our "hero" best friends with that jerk who kept screwing him over with the girl he was in love with? They would be at each other's throats in one scene and then best friends in the next! I would say that the only redeeming quality of this movie was the soundtrack, but then they started repeating the same songs over and over again. I guess the producers ran out of money to fund the rights to extra songs. They played "Whip It" twice, "Shake It Up" at least three times, and, at last count, "Just Once" like five times, when "Once" was certainly enough. Songs that I didn't know at the beginning of the movie I  knew by heart word for word by the end. To top it all off, this movie had one of the worst, most disastrous endings I've ever seen. I can maybe understand if this was a heartfelt, coming-of-age drama, but when you're doing a mindless, teen-sex comedy, you don't end on a downer and depress the audience! After all the hell our "hero" goes through, he ends up driving home alone without the girl and still a virgin, and then, without any follow-up or warning, the credits start rolling! I was like, "What the hell?" --- The only great thing about the movie is that I had a ball paying "MST3K," only no one was around to appreciate my witty, sardonic remarks, so I'll have to reproduce them here for your pleasure: ---   --- On Arguing with Your "Best Friend" Over the "Love of Your Life": --- "Hey, I stalked her first!" ---   --- On Sparking Up a Romance with Said Girl: --- "Remember our awkward conversation in my pizza mobile? Didn't that mean anything to you??" ---   --- On Declaring Your Love for Said Girl: --- "I've loved you ever since I destroyed your bike just so you'd talk to me!" ---   --- On Major Operations, "Not that Big a Deal": --- Real line (referring to the girl's upcoming abortion): "Hey, it happens all the time. It's not that big a deal." --- My line: "Yeah, it's a simple coat hanger procedure!" --- (and later) --- Real line: "I know dozens of girls who've done it!" --- My line: "I've helped all the gals in the neighborhood. They call me Dr. Abortion!" ---   --- On Nerds at Parties: --- "Man, there's nothing cooler than sucking from a juice box with a straw! Aww, yeah!!" ---   --- On Fat Girls, Inconsistent Characterizations of: --- Real line: "You know I have to be home by a quarter to 12!" --- (a minute later) --- "You said you had drugs! Where are they?" --- My line: "I have to be home by midnight or my parents will kill me! So fu*k me in the a$$ and let's do some blow before they come home!" ---   --- On Choose Your Mate Carefully: --- (as our "heroes" scratch their balls after having sex with a promiscuous, older woman) "Nothing's funnier than getting gonorrhea, eh folks?!" ---  --- Skip this dreck and rent "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" instead. At least that one had Phoebe Cates	neg
I bought this phone based on a review in Wired Magazine.  I love their reviews usually, but this one really let me down.  I read another customer's review (I forget where) saying they had sound quality problems, but I thought yeah right...one in a million.  Well I bought the phone and had the exact same experience.   ---  --- Very poor sound/voice quality.  It sounded worse than a cell phone in an underground wind tunnel.  I cannot imagine why. I charged the battery for 48 hrs, I had it on a separate circuit, and it had it's own line. I plugged in an old GE 2,4 ghz phone an whamo...no troubles what so ever.

I gotta be honest, when I first listened to this album I was dissapointed. But like any truly amazing album, it just took some decoding, listening to the songs multiple times reaaaallly helps to appreciate what these guys are doing. Essentially, GaT are four people who are amazing at what they do, and we should feel lucky that they have found a way to mesh together perfectly. Their first album, emphasizer, blew me away, but I felt it lost steam around halfway through. This album does no such thing, and what is more impressive is that this is an all acoustic album, which means skerik is using the natural sound of his sax as opposed to the various effects that he is known for. This gives the album a much more natural feel and it shows that these four are able to make amazing music without any wizardry in the production department. But dont get me wrong, this cd SOUNDS amazing. Anyway, I saw them live last night in NYC, and they blew my mind... I recommend this CD to ANYONE, and see them live if you get the RARE opportunity!	pos

I just wanted to comment on Sarah's comment which highlighted 3 intelligent men and her took seven hours to put it together.  My son wanted to time me and watch me put it together without help.  I agree if you treat the instructions with intelligence it will be complicated.  I took it in parts after reading it fully twice.  After all the small parts : pole, height adjustment apparatus, rim / backboard, i carried it all outside and put it togehter. One picture was complicated becuase of the small detail being overshadowed by the backboard.  Overall I got it done in parts, total time 2.5hrs with breaks in between.  Have fun and enjoy watching your kids smile brighten. 	pos
My 4 year old son got some early christmas money from his grandparents. So we went and bought this toy at Target (and paid 30.09 for it) He loves it... his favorite part was that you can take the whole thing apart and put it together different each time. My only concern was that the snow monster needs camera batteries or cell phone batteries??? What are those??	pos

This basket is NOT stainless steel as advertised.  It is merely chrome plated.  I returned it immediately and have been dinged for return shipping costs and other miscellaneous fees as the 'error was not our fault'.  Amazon is continuing to advertise this item as something it is not despite being alerted to the discrepancy by other consumers.  I believe that qualifies this error as being entirely their fault.  This is not the level of customer service I have come to expect and rely upon in my dealings with Amazon	neg
Typee is based on Melville's experiences when, as a young man of 22, he "jumped ship" from an American whaling vessel on the island of Nukuheva in the Marquesas Islands of the South Pacific.  It is written in a straightforward narrative manner, but it is a work of fiction, NOT a journalistic report, something that is often overlooked.  While, like "Moby Dick", it contains lots of factual details, mostly quite accurate as confirmed by subsequent research, it is a much more complex tale than it appears to be on the surface. ---  --- For a first novel, written when Melville was only 27 years old, the narrative power is quite impressive, as for example in his description of the escape from the ship over the mountains to the Valley of the Typee.  In the early chapters, themes of peace, beauty, and sensuality are combined with Melville's righteous indignation at the activities of Western military and religious intruders to create the illusion of an earthly paradise.  Gradually dread, loneliness, horror, and fear of annihilation come to the fore, as "Tommo", the protagonist, becomes convinced that he is being kept for eventual eating at a ritual cannibal feast.  He is finally rescued almost by chance, and because of conflict among the Typees. ---  --- I read the Oxford World's Classics paperback edition, which has an introduction by Ruth Blair, an Australian professor of English.  It was very helpful with Melville's historical and literary sources and the geographical and cultural context.  The chapter on "Typee" in "Studies in Classic American Literature" by D.H. Lawrence adds a further depth of understanding.  Newton Arvin's biography of Melville helps to place "Typee" in the development of Melville as a writer. ---  --- Highly recommended in its own right as a superb example of 19th century American romanticism, with hints of the impending metaphysical explosion of "Moby Dick"	pos

I thought a fold-up tub was a great idea, but we've used this only maybe 10 times before my daughter turned 6 months, the maximum age of use.  I paid only $10, so not much loss.  She objected the first time we tried it, at about 2 weeks, and so we went back to sponge baths for a while.  I would suggest gradually introducing your baby to the tub.  Toys helped distract her when she was a little older.  My daughter seemed too big for it even at 3 months, though she was always 97%+ in height & weight.  To wash her backside, you of course have to take her out of the tub.  I usually forgot to plug it before filling it, and so usually had water all over the floor.  Instructions say tub is supposed to be supported by a sink; it certainly doesn't fit in our oval bath sink.  Maybe it would fit a 2-part kitchen sink.  The folding feature did make it easy to store on our closet shelf.  For a little tub bath, I liked it.  It was good for a quick bath or to really soak her, but in the end I prefered a unhurried sponge bath on a waterproof pad on the bed, which I think got my daughter cleaner	pos
this movie was awfull.  supertroopers was awsome and beerfest was even better, so i suppose they can be forgiven for this cinematic abortion	neg
I would not recommend this product unless you absolutely cannot afford to spend any more money. For around $60, you could get the "World Industries M.A.D. Balance Board" and get a much better looking and more durable product. Or you could spend around $80 and get a Bongo Board. If you really want the best and have the money for it, you could spend about $120 and get an Indo Board. ---  --- The Zoomboard that I received was green and blue. Unfortunately, it looks garish, but a child may like the look of this. In addition to the garish coloring scheme, the board has a rough sandy underside. This is good because it allows the board to better grip the rolling tube. However, after a couple weeks of using it (five days each week for 30 minute sessions with my 140 lbs. frame), the tube develops craters from the sand and wears down. Then again, if you wait it out, the sand eventually will slough off of the board itself and you won't have to worry about wearing down your rolling tube. But the gripping surface will be compromised. ---  ---  If you try using this on a hard floor and not carpeting, the rolling tube starts to move less fluidly than before. Make sure there are no grains, pebbles, or hard materials on the surface you are practicing on because they can easily ruin your rolling tube. This may be a failing of boards that use a wood rolling tube. ---  --- Overall, this board is fun, but not great quality. If you absolutely cannot afford $10 more to purchase a much better product, then buy this board and use it sparingly on a carpet to get a long life out of it.  If you can afford more, keep looking and check out the products that I mentioned above and get something that'll actually be worth your hard-earned money	neg

Xenosaga II-Jenseits von Gut und Boese came in November to Europe and was the first Xenosaga, which was released here!!! But we European players never played Xenosaga I before, so Namco released the second Xenosaga in a great "Special Box". In this box was the game itself and a Movie-DVD with nearly all Xenosaga I movies.  --- Back to topic, in my opinion Xenosaga II is a pretty game with cool movies and a battle system that makes fun. --- The music in this game was composed from Yuki Kajiura in the movies and Shinji Hosoe in the rest of the game. I think Kajiuras music is really good but Shinji Hosoe did a bad job, with his elevator music ;o) --- The graphics are okay but I couldn't see anything outstanding. --- In the end I must say, that Xenosaga II is a good RPG, even if it's not so wonderful than the first Xenosaga. That's the reason, why I imported Xenosaga I from your country ^_~  --- But at last the most PAL-players are happy, that actually (my dictionary doesn't give me the right English translation for "ueberhaupt" ;_; sorry) Xenosaga II come to Europe yet!!!! --- So I look forward to the third and last Xenosaga and hope, that this Episode will be like the first!!!! --- Many greets from Germany.....Viele Gruee aus Deutschland ^	pos
It is unfortunate that the only video presentation of Amahl is so generously flawed in stagecraft and sound production. It is not necessary to enumerate specifics here since some were cited in Ms. Lynch's review. True, Ms. Stratas' voice was often subjugated by the orchestra, but there were also  moments when her diction was less than perfect, during times which the orchestra had, gratefully, been relegated to a less prominent decibel level.  Here, sound production staff  must share blame.  Menotti knew what he was writing. A brilliant orchestrator, he etched clearly, the differences between orchestral dialogue and accompaniment figures. Staging, at times, appears to have little to do with the music. When one thinks of Menotti and opera (almost synonymous), the marriage of music AND theatre is considered a perfect union. Sadly, Menotti's obvious musical intentions were overlooked. It is heartening to read that a new video of this opera may be produced. I would disagree with Ms. Lynch that it is a good introduction to this operatic work. The beginning, the introduction makes the strongest impression.  It is lasting.  This is one indelibility I would not welcome	neg
We have used Kona coffee pods for about a year.  They were excellent.  We found it more convenient to order through Amazon, as the shipment arrived more quickly.

This review may sound pretentious and ignorant, but in truth I'm a big fan of British history, so bear with me!   ---  --- Even as a film itself, it's surreal, and I don't like the acting.  But as with any historical film that includes the British, they're made out to be the absolute bad guys!  Sure we were forging an empire within France (i.e. The Hundred Years War), but rapists and murdering pillagers!?  Never! ---  --- Historically accurate, full of British sentiment, and down-right weird.  Avoid this film today, folks!	neg
I've owned two of these now. The screen's great and I love the wireless headphones -- terrific for very small children. Our 2-year-old drove to New Mexico and back (well, we drove and he watched videos) with this thing.  ---  --- Unfortunately, both units broke after less than a year of use. The first one just stopped working (with a DVD permanently trapped inside). The second one just developed an intermittent white-out and screen noise that's happening once a minute now. So I am reluctantly abandoning this nice but very poorly made product and trying a different one.  ---  --- All of these little players seem to have reliability problems, so my main advice to everybody is BUY THE EXTENDED WARRANTY and make sure the warranty you buy will work swiftly and easily with no hassles -- you WILL be cashing it in	neg

When a movie producer in 1998 foregoes available spectrum of colors and technology opting to feed his audience grain-black, white and jittery gray, the result had better be good. That fraction of members of the technicolor-drunk general viewing audience who will even stipulate to watch such a thing do so at decided perils of time and money, push Play alongside Mr. Benefit-Of-A-Doubt and strain to see if it works. Thus begins the argument of effect and more specifically, that of color. The problem with a black and white movie is that very few movies that resort to that, despite some grand intention, DO NOT WORK, or, in the alternative, DO NOT WORK AS WELL. Citing two examples - SIN CITY which is near-tolerable acting paired with an absurd choice of black and white, tantamount to robbery, and GOOD NIGHT AMERICA which is all and about the same. The dilemma with black and white productions is that regardless of how well it comes together, there seems always a thread of an argument in the back of one's mind that if one must resort to black and white to make one's point, one might be better served as a charcoal artist. Color is the medium of life. From a budgetary perspective, black and white films save money as the 'challenges' of color, which, in a good feature, can be excessive, are thus eliminated. Yet complications arise - for instance - I wasn't sure if that was blood or motor oil dripping from that guy's hand. Similarly, the entire cast in SIN CITY could have been wearing hot pink, in shades of course, and we would never know. Yet of course this is no excuse to dislike a movie - or is it? One wonders, however, that, if PI production would have had more money, would they have opted for color? Moot point. It's done. ---  --- Notwithstanding the obvious that I don't prefer black and white movies and incidentally don't know lots of people who do, PI, although a courageous artistic attempt with significant merits ranging from creative camera work, clever symbolism and high-octane guts, seems to lanquish for other reasons. Despite PI's visceral intensity which is delibertaely hot-wired throughout, spinning out scenes that sizzle the nerves, after Max's third or fourth headache it gives up the ghost. As as result, the movie stays earthbound, weighted down by a mediocre revolving-door plotline (obsessing man chases number grail looking for key to life while beset by outside forces including the recycling feeds of his own troubled mind), unremarkable narrative with a gem here and there, failing repetitive effect and thin, uninspiring 2-D support cast, leaving the movie wanting for depth and intelligent character interplay. Unresolved imagery and scenes lent the impression that this creative endeavor was a bit out of control and ad-hoc which is no fatal flaw in and of itself but in this case was signficantly detractive. Despite a reasonably decent stockpile of cinematic victories the battle wasn't won. The themes inspiring PI have excellent potential however this movie trafficked the runway like an antiquated flying machine - airborne one second, belly down the next. As a fine creative exercise, the creators are praised for their effort and bravery - PI is as bodacious as a skunk engaging rush-hour traffic and commands the watcher's attention until that undefined moment when boredom sets in. Contains subterranean theme seedlings which likely served as brain fertilizer for the subsequent more advanced spin-off -  "A Beautiful Mind"	neg

...and if you're fortunate enough to find it, I recommend buying the version with the bonus DVD, which chronicles the making of Yellow Brick Road.  When I bought it, it cost the same as the 2 SACD set without the DVD, so it was still a great deal. ---  --- My only complaint--and it's really minor--is that it would have been nice if they could have fit the original album onto a single SACD.  A second disc could have included the bonus tracks that are included in this package, plus any extra--maybe even audio-only interviews--still remaining in the vaults.  No matter.  The important thing, if you are able, is to make sure you have an SACD-compatible player (like the Pioneer DV-563A, or one of the really expensive players if you've got the cash and love audiophile formats in both your hardware and your CDs).  Even if you don't, the stereo CD layer still sounds truly excellent	pos

I can understand that Robin felt a need to include some of the biggest Bee Gees hits to appease the fans, but the ones that were sung by Barry are below wretched here.  Robin frequently disappears in the sound mix, becoming little more than one of a group singing harmony.  That's fine for a group concert, like the Bee Gees, but inexcusable for a solo effort.  His stiff between song talk sounds like a bad lounge act.  They should have kept this in the can.  It seems like it is meant as little more than a money grab for Robin. Don't do him the favor	neg

I love the FIRM workouts, and I love the instructor Allie, so I was so excited to try this new workout.  I was unfortunately extremely disappointed. ---  --- This workout was not complicated, but it also wasn't much of a workout.  I didn't get my heart rate up at all, and didn't break a sweat.  Some of the moves are just not very good, and having to repeat them everytime we add on got really annoying. ---  --- The disco part was my favorite, but overall, this is a workout that I can honestly say I would rather have the money then the workout.  I will keep it and periodically do it on a VERY light day or in addition to another workout, but that's just because I have it.   ---  --- I've tried a couple other of the new FIRM workouts that are more worth the money...this one I am sad to say is not.	neg

With a title like 'swirl skirt,' you'd expect the fabric to be able to, well, swirl.  But the fabric is stiff and not very comfortable.

I was more or less forced to buy this product because I had very precise size requirements and this product fitted them.  I was very disappointed by the quality of the product for the cost.  It comes in about 19 different pieces, all of which are a hollow plastic polymer.  It is fairly lightweight, which could be good or bad depending on what you plan to do with it.  At the $200+ price, you'd think they would include a shelf, but they only give you a stencil to make it yourself out of 'shelving material'. ---  --- My biggest complaint was that I was missing four of the pieces and had other extra pieces when I received it.  I got bounced back and forth between Amazon and Suncast's customer service before I got the right people at Suncast to send me replacement parts (which took over a week to arrive).  On top of that, they didn't even send me the right replacement parts!  After another phone call and explanation, more parts were sent.  If I keep the extras I have, and make a couple more calls, I may have enought for a second shed.  Ugh. ---  --- Directions are ok, but they'll make you scratch your head as you look through all the similiar looking parts. Especially when they don't send you the right pieces	neg

The views do not show the belt and buckle. I cannot tell from the photos if the buckle closes in the middle or is offset to the side. ---  --- Why does this matter? For me, it's vital information. When I'm backpacking I carry my glasses/camera/pen/notebook in a fanny pack. Of course the backpack waistband buckle is in the middle, over the navel. If the fanny pack buckle is also in the middle then the two buckles interfere with each other. ---  --- A few manufacturers are wise to this conflict. They make fanny packs with the buckle closure offset--between the left hip bone and the navel. The two waistband buckles do not interfere with each other. ---  --- I won't be considering this product because I cannot discern the photograph	neg
I bought this ab roller after my chiropractor told me that I needed to strengthen my abs without straining my neck.

Ummm...I am a HUGE fan of Bratz, but this piece of junk is absolutely terrible. First of all, the eyes are super ugly. I can't believe they would make such an ugly product! The lips are fine.

Look, notation software is notoriously expensive.  All musicians know that.  So, when you see SongWriter and its price, it's a relief.  Everything you need is in this program.  I only have one complaint. ---  --- When adding an expressive dynamic (p,mp,mf,f,ff,etc.) you have to add one to EACH note to insure proper playback.  That is a concern of mine since I use SongWriter to notate songs and export them in MIDI for recording purposes.  It leaves an ugly looking score. ---  --- Other than that, this is the best deal on the market for what it is	pos

Extremely disappointed, especially after having done a lot of research and read the great reviews that this product (and the Axion 7" player) received.   ---  --- I bought it for my wife for a road trip and she was excited about the large screen and the ability to connect an antenna to watch tv.  The player worked fine for the first DVD we tried, but after that the screen freaked out and went almost black.  You couldn't see a picture but you could hear the movie just fine.  No complaints about the sound I guess, but what good is that if the screen doesn't work? ---  --- Needless to say I returned this as fast as possible.  In fact, if I could rate it less than one star I would, since it didn't even last one day. Terrible product	neg

This is a neat little movie about a 12-year-old boy (Anton Glanzelius) who tries to make sense of his mother's terminal illness, death in general, and a world full of change. He tries to cheer his mother up as best he can, but she is too far gone to really notice or care. His fondest memories are times spent at the beach with her when she was healthier and their times together were better. As a coming-of-age movie, sex plays an important (and confusing) part for the boy, from the old bedridden man in the upstairs apartment who likes him to read the lingerie ads to him, to the tomboy who is the best soccer player on his team and keeps trying to show him her breasts. The movie is full of wonderful, insightful touches. Glanzelius is marvelous. A real gem of a movie	pos
Halo 1 on steroids, Halo 2 is a clear Microsoft stamp on Bungie's creativity and control and it muddies up what was a balanced gameplay.  A hackneyed single player story that makes no sense, and has no flow, along with levels that aren't replayable.  You thought the Library from Halo1 was tedious?  Try the headache inducing map design in this game.  Also in the nonsense, the unneccesary switch to an Elite's perspective for half the game, along with a new group of Covenant bad guys that look like rejects from a Captain Planet cartoon.  Apes with mohawks, yeah, nice design.  I can only play one or two levels of the single player, and they are so noobish, it loses appeal quickly.  ---  --- On to Multiplayer.  Okay, in 2004 upon release, this was a great game.  It took time to go up in level, and the ranking system wasn't as abused as it is now.  Once new maps, kept on the harddrive (read mod kids) were released by Bungie, that opened the door to full blown chaos.  Now 2 years later, modding has died down somewhat, but a whole new slew of bridging and connection speed manipulation makes it roughly 25% likely you'll find a game with no lag.  So I still play on occasion, it's lame they can't offer dedicated servers so you can play your map of choice, choose servers with good connections, and then the modders and big gun noobs can find the type of game they want to play too.  I only pray Halo 3's multiplayer improves on this system, otherwise I'm done with the Xbox console permanently	neg

This magazine is just page after page of Hollywood P.R. agencies releases. Unbelievable. Why didn't I think of it? I know all magazines look for editorial content from outside sources, but other than a few pages of VERY subjective movie/music/book reviews, this magazine just re-writes and prints Hollywood press release after Hollywood press release again and again and again. This magazine must not have a staff of writers, but must employ an army of copy editors manning a warehouse of dedicated fax machines or e-mail inboxes. The funniest thing about this magazine is how the first few pages may be dedicated to a typically obsequious press release provided by, say, Tom Cruise's management company/major film studio/hired PR flak fawning over Cruise or his newest movie - and then you turn to the movie review section where some clever, sassy, wanna-be hipster movie reviewer proceeds to tell you that the movie absolutely sucks. Uh, okay - wait, didn't you get the press release? If you Tivo EXTRA and have the theme to Entertainment Tonight as your ringtone, this magazine is right up your alley. Otherwise, don't waste a penny on this nonsense.  --- 	neg
I have this exact same soft light green deluxe pillow. I bought the pillow when she was about 2 weeks old. And I have been wearing it almost all day long every day since. She is 11 weeks old today. She is so comfortable when nursing on this pillow. The cushion is made of firm foam. She falls asleep on the pillow while it is around my waist. Even when she's not nursing or napping, the pillow helps me to support her weight when I'm sitting or standing. It fits me very comfortably even though I'm plus size. ---  --- The only drawback is that I need to order an additional slipcover because it can only be hung to dry, although it is machine washable. I really love this fabric, but apparently, this fabric is not available to purchase separately as a slipcover, so I guess I'll try the oatmeal twill cover.	pos
This is the Optimus Prime that should have been made 20 years age. It was a difficult decision whether to open it or save it in the original packaging.

this thing is really cool and works very easily.

We've had 3 of the LG1500 in our family plan for nearly a year.  Very inconsistent service.  When calling our son, I would get a message that his number was "blacklisted".  After calling Cingular several times, we demanded new phones...not LG1500.  We were told it was "like for like" exchange, but that policy is not in writing...so we're getting a different brand.

Overall, this is the best gaming magazine I have read.  It covers all consoles, gives sensible (and funny) reviews, and previews the hottest upcomming games.   ---  --- Most games are reviewed by two people, adding to the accuracy of the score.  It has a rating of 1-10, 10 being the best, a rating which precious few games recieve.   ---  --- The previews section gives you a sneek peek of upcomming games.  Some of them are one page long, some ten.  They all include pictures, and most have an estimated release date. ---  --- Also, there is a section on news in the game industry.  Ususlly near the beginning of the magazine, they include news on developers, consoles, and the big names in the industry.   ---  --- All in all, this is a great magazine, and well worth your money, because each issue is well over 100 pages	pos
Kudos Microsoft. My last go around with Encare was with the 2004 version. At that time the program had a cluttered clusmey interface. The various modules weren't intuitive or intergrated and it was therefore, confusing and not partuiclarly user friendly. The new interface is quite simple but very powerful. It is well integrated with the web and therefore capable of constant updating. Perfect for the student and anyone who likes to research topics. If you have not tried Encarta in a while, check it out, there is much to like. 	pos

I have owned eleven VCOM products and from now on, they don't have my business. The product touts itself in part as a vital tool when/if your machine crashes. If it does, be prepared to shell out the cost for another complete program. You are told that the program is already installed on another machine and you can't run it-although this occurs after a lengthy and cumbersome installation process. Sadly, customer assistance is no help-emails are unanswered and you can't get through via phone...What you do get from them once you register are constant emails about new products. Thanks, folks. Version 6.0 is also much slower than Version 5. Support for 5.0, by the way stopped abruptly when the new edition came out, despite the functionality of that program.   For the price, the software should work like a major player, rather than a dollar bin special. 	neg

The French title of this film is IN EXTREMIS (though translated as TO THE EXTREME) and means 'in desperate circumstances, especially at the point of death'.  Rethinking the story of this interesting but problematic movie in those terms after viewing  gives the cinematic effort more poignancy.  This is a tale of the impact of family, loss of parents, dissolution of the core unit has on us all: in this story we are asked to exam the 'in extremis' state of such trauma. ---  --- Thomas (Sbastien Roch) is a hedonist, a handsome young man whose parents died in an Alpine accident, and a man who sleeps with both sexes in a confused state of true identity.  He lives with one of his female lovers who has a young teenage son Grgoire (Jrmy Sanguinetti) whom he loves as a son.  When the mother accidentally dies, Grgoire wants Thomas to be his guardian.  Thomas' lifestyle does not lend itself to fatherhood and though he deeply loves Grgoire, by law and by proclivity he cannot assume the role of foster parent.  Even with the aid of his prostitute sister Anne (Julie Depardieu) he is unable to keep the disappointed Grgoire from being sent to a prison-like orphanage.  Thomas finds solace from his lover Vincent (Aurlien Wiik) and from his excursions into the bohemian all night orgies where he attempts to forget his promise to be available at all times for Grgoire.  Eventually Thomas' devotion to Grgoire overcomes his hedonistic addiction and results in his aiding the boy's escape from the orphanage to move with him to the home in Ibiza his deceased parents owned.  The story has a bizarre but touching ending, which comes totally unexpectedly, and revealing it would ruin the impact and message of the film. ---  --- Director/writer Etienne Faure ('Prisonnier', and ' la recherche de Tadzio' which is included on this CD and traces the life of the actor Bjrn Andresen who played Tadzio in the film 'Death in Venice') directs his actors well but is less successful in finding the interaction of flashbacks, fantasies, graphic indulgences and superimposed poetry inundated with noisy music.  But given these distractions the film still makes a simple case for the significance of family - genetic and extended - and therein is the power of the story.  This is obviously the work of a young director with copious ideas about film and as such one can forgive many of the early experimental indulgences because the heart is in the right place.  In French with English subtitles.  Grady Harp, May 05  --- 	pos

If you are looking to make a mess, lose milk and get frustrated, these are the bags for you.  First, these bags do no stand up on there own and it is very inconveniant to carry a little cup around to help fill the bag. You have to string the twist-tie into each bag by yourself.  Also you are supposed to tear the little tab on the bottom of the bag to get the milk out.  It's not that easy.  The first time I did it I lost a whole bunch of milk.  Your better off untwisting the tie and pouring it from there.  The worst thing about the bag is that they have leaked a few times that my caregiver was warming up the milk.  This never happened with the other bags on the market.  My favorite is lansinoh.  Another bag thing about these Medela bags are that they are more expensive than the others.  Pass on this and try others	neg

Abby Cooper has become my favorite amateur PI. The premise of this series, a young woman private detective who has strong psychic abilities which she uses to solve cases, is original and fun to read. Abby is a psychic, but she also has the same trials and tribulations of a normal young woman, money, sibling and romance issues. In this latest book, Abby, her sister Cat, and Abby's handyman Dave, buy and plan to renovate a house, only the house turns out to be haunted! Poor Dave, Abbey's partner and handyman, is attacked by his own chainsaw as he begins the renovation! Determined to find out what's going on, Abby begins investigating the history of the home and discovers a missing treasure with ties to WWII Nazi Germany. In order to solve the mystery, Abby depends on her spirit guides to help her on the case. There is danger for Abby and her friends from an unknown stalker and the romance between Abby and Dutch becomes more intense as they each must sacrifice some of their independence to become a real couple. Ms. Laurie has a great series going here, and I look forward to reading more Abby mysteries.	pos

I am in my early 30's and never had a problem with acne until my mid 20's.  I had been using proactiv for quite some time (5 years or so) and it worked pretty well.  I say pretty well since it did clear my face some, but my face has not been totally clear in a long time. ---  --- Along comes AcneFree which is "better" than Proactiv since you can buy it locally and it contains more of the active ingredient--cool, I am sick of ordering it online and it is cheaper! ---  --- Well, I guess you get what you pay for--I don't consider myself to have particularly sensitive skin, but I used AcneFree one time in the morning.  So far so good--until 2 am the next morning when I broke out in hives all over my entire body.  So no more AcneFree for me, just wanted to give my experience for anyone who might be in the same situation	neg

I have only read the Swedish translation of what I suppose is the "old edition", but judging by "Look inside this book", this new English-language edition incorporates much material from the old. Incidentally, the Swedish edition gives the authors name as Kallistos Ware, apparently his taken Orthodox name, while Timothy Ware is his original, given name.  ---  --- In Sweden, the Swedish translation of "The Orthodox Church" is the only readily available book on the history of the Orthodox Church. Apparently, its used informally as a textbook in some college classes on Church history. It also contains chapters on theology and worship. ---  --- In my opinion, the book is a necessary introduction for those interested in Orthodox Church history. Its first chapters summarize the history of this Church during the Byzantine Empire, under Islam, and in Russia both before and during Communism. Of particular interest is the authors interpretation of the Catholic-Orthodox split, usually dated to 1054. The author believes that the so-called Fourth Crusade in 1204 was the real and final consummation of this split.  ---  --- However, the book must also be read with some reservations. The author is, after all, an Orthodox Christian himself. Its safe to assume that there is a certain bias here and there. For instance, Ware denies that the Byzantine Church was caesaropapist, a very untenable suggestion. At other times, he is surprisingly "liberal" for an Orthodox. For instance, he paints Mehmet Fatih, the Muslim conqueror of Constantinople, as a very tolerant ruler. I also wonder about his interpretation of the Church father Cyprian.  ---  --- Even so, "The Orthodox Church" remains an indepensable book for those looking for a short and concise historical over-view of this remarkable Christian Church.  --- 	pos

Plus trying to fully uninstall it is a nightmare. ---  --- It might work on XP but don't get it if you have Vista. 	neg
The author shows she is obviously making a transition from poetry to prose with this novel.  Her sentences are long and wordy, and her numerous metaphors make little sense in their context.  She goes to great lengths to describe many little and unimportant details, causing the actual story to suffer from lack of content.  Her descriptions of life in general seem unreal - she describes things and events in a way that no person would do in the circumstance. ---  --- The storyline is decent in some places, but it is generally hard for the reader to follow.  Many times, I had to go back to read paragraphs and pages again to realize where the author was going.  It is true there were many points in which I wanted to stop reading all together, which is a rarity. ---  --- I was altogether disappointed in the book.  I thought it would be decent, from all the literary awards it had won, but it really was just pages of fluff and poetry disguised as prose	neg

I can not stand this book. I can't even finish reading it. Kevin J Anderson can not write original Star Wars books at all. The only thing I have ever seen with his name on it that was entertaining was the Dark Lords of the Sith comic book. Everything he writes is unoriginal and lacking in story. He seems to have some obsession with Death Stars and world destroyers because all he seems to put in his books are those. Darksaber, Jedi Search, Dark Apprentice, Champions of the Force, heck even the IG-88 story he wrote for Tales of the Bounty Hunters had the Death Star tied in (IG-88 transfers himself into the Death Star...what the heck?) Seriously, this book is not worth it. Try Timothy Zahn or Michael Stackpole. At least they don't always use Death Stars. And while Zahn's last 3 books are based around Thrawn, the original Heir to the Empire, Dark Force Rising and The Last Command, when Thrawn first appeared, was not him dry humping the same concept over and over	neg

I prefer the live versions of these pieces. Its nice to get more material from that period but you can hear the strain that was going on at the time of this final album by this line-up.

This movie is funny and by being so bold in so many ways is refreshing.  It presents realistic characters without worrying about offending people by presenting sterotypes.  It takes the time to develope the story effectively without boring the audience.  It is a long movie but it moves at a great and effective pace. ---  --- It is full of laughs.  Joe Pesci is one of the best comic actors of all time.  I don't think that anyone else could have pulled of the part of Vinny nearly as well.  Marisa was great as well and it was hard to find a performance that was less than great.  The writing and directing, two things that often get overlooked, was wonderful.  The only weakness?  The case is a little fantastic.  It is hard to believe the coincidences in the movie that lead to the boys being accused of the crime.  Of course movie plots don't have to make perfect sense but this stretches it.   ---  --- Though I usually don't like excessive foul language, this movie uses it in a funny way.  I guess it wouldn't work without it... --- but don't be mistaken....it has a lot of bad language.  Don't let kids under 17 watch it without supervision	pos

I had an Optoma H27 but felt it was lacking the brightness I liked on TV, and I heard that HD72 was much better.  So I returned my H27 to Costco and got the HD6800, which is Costco's version of the HD72.  Wow, "much better" hardly describes it!  The brightness is incredible, and the detail and colors are truly remarkable.  The other night, I was trying out different DVDs just to see what they looked like on the new system, and I was totally blown away. ---  --- While it does upscale DVD images to look better on its system, I also bought a Sony upscaling DVD player and there is a significant improvement with it with the HDMI connection.  I had read that since they are both upscaling, the DVD player's upscaling wouldn't be necessary, but I do find the image through the upscaling DVD the best in a side-by-side test using two Sony DVD players and two DVDs of the recently restored "Carousel" using component, s-video, and HDMI at the same time, all connected to the HD72.  I saw clearer detail on faces coming from the HDMI upscaling DVD player.   ---  --- I was so impressed, I felt like pulling in people from the street to see it, but I fought the impulse because I don't want to share it with anyone.   ---  --- With a little tweaking of the menus, new films like "Star Wars III" and "Sin City" showed incredible detail, and older films like "The Adventures of Robin Hood" were gorgeous in their Technicolor glory. ---  --- I highly recommend the HD72.	pos

I bought these for my dvd player.  They work wonderfully!  The old analog cables that came with the dvd player looked alright but [didn't measure up}.

I bought Taxcut this year because it was inexpensive and included business tax forms for my partnership. For the money I guess I'm satisfied with the partnership results, but that's where it ends. ---  --- Taxcut for Federal taxes is not integrated with Taxcut for business... ok so what do you want for cheap. But, it also isn't well integrated with the Massachusetts state tax version, leaving me to go figure how to deal with what it calls "special" situations (unreimbursed partner expenses and interest from out of state banks, for example). Overriding form data is painful and the program complains that if I override calculated data I can not e-file (not that I would trust it to e-file my taxes). Form navigation is hopeless. I can only imagine what someone who isn't experienced with tax preparation could accomplish with this mess. ---  --- I filed for an extension; now I'm probably going to buy Turbotax to do the actual federal and state returns. ---  --- With a deep discount, I would probably purchase Taxcut again for the partnership taxes, because it is slightly easier to use than the Excel spreadsheets I'd been using (but only because I don't have to copy the numbers from the spreadsheets into the forms). ---  --- Honestly, you would think there would be some tax software that is better than the non-functional Taxcut without the overblown, fatty and expensive too-many-talking-heads Turbotax alternative	neg

Ohhhhhhhhhh my my my, what can I say about this one?  By the time it entered home video on vhs in late 1987, I was not familiar with Freddy at all except for the fact that I knew the premise....he can kill in your dreams and goes after kids and teens.  The fact that I was at that time only goin on age 15 did not help.  I was terrified of anything related to horror.  In my mind Freddy was the worst.  As a scared 15 year old kid, Freddy was the last thing I wanted to view.  I was watching films like, Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Empire Strikes Back.  Those I could handle.  However, in late summer of 1987, a friend of mine rang me up and told me to come over because he had a new movie he had rented that he wanted me to watch.  I asked him what it was and he wouldnt tell me.  All he said was that id be surprised and that id really like it.  So, I went over and he wouldnt let me see the title on the box.  He just slid it into the slot of the VCR.  Folks, I saw the New Line Cinema Logo and then this graphic,  "Sleep, those little slices of death.  How I loathe them....Edgar Allan Poe"  My mind started to reel but I had not yet realized what this film was; and then I saw the title, "A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 3: DREAM WARRIORS."  Now mind you the closest I ever came to seeing this film was the wonderfully cool Dokken Video on MTV called, Dream Warriors.  I even had a hard time viewing the visage of Freddy in that MTV video.  Hilarious huh??  Anyway, when I saw the title come up, I grabbed my coat and I was getting the hell out of there and quickly.  However, my buddy begged me to give it a chance, he said its not as bad as I was thinkin and that id actually find certain parts of it actually funny.  Now I thought he was pullin my leg with that statement.  Even his mother told me id like it.  She had already seen it in the theatres and so had my buddy.  So, once I heard her reassure me as well, I decided to give it a chance.  As the opening of the film carried on I viewed the front cover on the box.  A vicious looking cover with Freddy's face leering over several teens facing him, appearing to stand on his out-stretched knives with a tagline that I find today to be one of the most creative taglines ever!!!  "If you think you'll get out alive, you must be dreaming."  Anyhow, suffice it to say, after experiencing dream warriors, I was instantly relieved and I was also an instant fan!!  I couldnt believe it actually because id sworn this character off.  I was terrified of him.  I suppose id have to thank my buddy Mike C. for that.  Thank you Mike for opening the door to this series for me.  Ive loved it ever since.  Ive seen all of them.  Many argue and argue over which film is the best, but Dream Warriors will always hold a special place in my heart because it was my first Nightmare and the first time I had to get ready for Freddy!!  :)  Hope you enjoyed my review.   By the way, I did laugh during my first viewing, and I also feel that poster art was the best of all of them	pos

 I have just started with an Apple ipod nano product and was not impressed with the factory included ear buds at all. They didn't sound real good and didn't come supplied with the ear bud pads in the box so they would just fall out of your ears. What's the deal with that? Next came the old Sony MDR 027 head phones from the closet. The Sony's have the old adjustable head bar so no more falling out of the ears now. They worked o.k., I guess, but in comparison these JBuds sound MUCH better than either of the previous ones. I'm now listening at half volume compared to about three quarters before and all sounds fine. I'm hearing parts of the music not audible before with the other two models. Crisper highs, great mid range, and responsive lows. Set up was fast too, just find the correct size ear bud pads out of the three different sized pairs supplied and your off and running. The JBuds actually stay in your ear. Wow what a concept. They are also very comfortable due to the fact I forgot they were in and started talking on the phone before noticing. The cord is just the right length for setting the ipod on a desk while still allowing plenty of movement or attaching it to a pocket. If you think you have a little too much just wrap some up with a bread tie. Better too much than not enough. So back to the closet with the Sony.  ---   ---  I guess what it all boils down to is you could do a whole lot worse than these especially for a mere twenty bucks. I couldn't have made a better choice for the money and quality. You should do the same.  ---  ---  Another quick note. The shipping went great. Not too long at all and with standard USPS. Thanks Amazon	pos
My daughter and I have played all of the previous games; we've enjoyed them overall.  Some of the games are fantastic, challenging and fun. This game was quite lame in comparison to the others.  The puzzles weren't really puzzling, just boring tasks.  There were not many clues to find.  Because there weren't many clues, there was no real sense of detecting anything.  The game ended abruptly and was very short.  We did NOT use a walk-through to solve the mystery in record time, just experienced a lack of challenge.  We did like the newness of becoming Frank and Joe Hardy occasionally.  The rest was pretty boring.  If you are looking for a Nancy Drew game, try one of the others instead	neg
I ordered this item with the hope of finding a new home for my ever-growing collection of credit cards, grocery store cards, insurance cards, club cards, hotel cards, airline cards... you get the point.  I was disappointed to discover that placing more than one card in the wallet prevents the "Accardion" from collapsing enough to zip close.  I can't imagine how such a defective design would ever have made it to market. ---  --- Unless you want a really large leather case for a single credit card, I would not recommend this product	neg
The pic that I ordered showed a knee length half slip.  Instead I received 3 long half slips from Her Room.  I cannot use the long half slips and I sent them back. --- Also, I had bought them with a gift certificate from my granddaughter and couldn't find where to apply that, so the cost was put on my visa. --- Thanks. --- Jeanne Alle	neg
The episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes. This one happens to be only 18 minutes. This mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle. Even though it only cost me $2 I still got jipped.  Let's hope Amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway. Be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them	neg
These hair topia pills are nothing but garbage! Pure nonsense! Trust me, I know this because I used to buy them.  I first bought these pills last year in June 2005 after hair formula 37's unsuccessful promise of producing longer and stronger hair in the four months of usage. Well, these pills were not as expensive as the previous brand mentioned, and had promised also change dry and brittle hair into long and healthy, and it did absolute NOTHING. I said to myself, like hair formula 37, that maybe I just need to give this more time, so I bought a 2-month supply and gave it 3 months in all and there was no difference at all. This product might just work for others, which it has, but it certainly didn't work for me. I must admit that I brought this on myself, as my mother warned me not to buy these ridiculously expensive pill since they do nothing for hair that grows naturally anyway, and that if you really want to get hair pills then just buy them a whole lot cheaper in regular stores like Giant or even hair vitamins in the damn Dollar Store! Thus, I am here to warn others not to waste their precious money. And if you are going to, please don't do it on this site-you can buy this product a little cheaper at hairboutique.com.	neg
I absolutely love this camera. I've told everyone I know to buy it. The picture quality is amazing. There are so many options with this tiny little camera! You can edit pictures before you even print them. Zoom in on a picture already taken and save it that way, and so much more. I take pictures of everything!  ---  --- I charged the battery when I got the camera, which was about three weeks ago, and it's still going. I have 7/8th of battery life left. I haven't had to charge it again.  ---  --- I am so happy with my purchase! I hope this helps you	pos
I bought this item for my newborn - thinking it would grow with him and be useful for at least the 1st year.  I was SO wrong.  First, as I feared, the water "fishbowl" leaked the 1st time I filled it.  I returned it and the next one leaked as well.  Then, the mirror is one of those "plastic" mirrors that gives a distorted reflection - which was of no value or interest to my son. The cow that makes noise died after less than a month of light to no use.  Finally, the toy just didn't have that "fun" value that a $43 toy should have.  He hated it - never attempted to crawl down it, never played with the features. Save your money - this toy is of poor quality and poor entertainment value. There are tons of better products out there..	neg
 "The Dreaming was one of those albums that I found in my parents CD collection when I was young and I haven't outgrown it yet. My parents seemed to hate it and never bought a Kate Bush CD after it (though I recently bought her whole collection except "The Whole Story" as it's just a greatest hits!). This album took me a very long time to get into however. I listened to it several times as a child and then put it away because I thought it was too strange. I took it out then several years later and loved it. I would now say it could be my all time favourite CD and is better than "Hounds Of Love" as I see it. The songs all stand on their own and Bush's voice is brilliant and her quirky themes shine through. This is the only album that I will never skip a track because I'm always in the mood for them all. ---  ---  1. "Sat In Your Lap"- A great opening track. Bush deals with whether she can be bothered to do something or not. The instruments are great as always. ---  2. "There Goes A Tenner"- A notable song for the quirky British accent Bush puts on. The instruments are very good and remind me of the '80's (as it was made then!). That was a good decade for music! ---  3. "Pull Out The Pin"- The piano arrangement is excellent in this song and the chorus is so good. The lyrics are about someone who is in war and thinking about pulling out the pin of a grenade. The song was inspired by a documentary. ---  4. "Suspended In Gaffa"- I don't actually know what Gaffa is but this song is still so great and catchy. The lyrics are quirky and the instrumentation is excellent. ---  5. "Leave It Open"- An excellent song that reminds me more of "Hounds Of Love". The instrumentation is excellent as always. ---  6. "The Dreaming"- Another brilliant song which is so funny because of Bush's Australian accent. The production is good and so is the songwriting. ---  7. "Night Of The Swallow"- The use of Irish traditional music is a nice effect to this song. The singing by Bush is superb and the song is flawless! ---  8. "All The Love"- The song has a sadder feel to it but is excellent. The lyrics are unusual and very well done. The instruments complement Bush's superb voice and never overtake! ---  9. "Houdini"- The album cover is to do with this song. The song is excellent with a really quirky chorus and good instrumentation. ---  10. "Get Out Of My House"- A perfect way to end an amazing album. The lyrics are so good and it is so funny at the end when she turns into a mule (within the song obviously). It is something only Kate Bush could have written! ---  ---  Overall I think it is an amazing album though I can see why people don't like it. It could be a little too experimental for some though for me it is perfect. Kate Bush shows she was the original alternative female and the best (yes, she's better than Tori Amos). She is one of the few geniuses of music and an all time amazing artist. Reccomended to everyone into alternative, especially Tori Amos fans! ---  ---  MARK- 10/1	pos
The tale starts out with a historical reference to Chaucer.  For a fraction you wonder if you are watching the film you expected. And then you see the Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger eagle that transitions us form mid-evil times to present day (1944) England. ---  --- Time is taken to give depth and background to all the main characters by the use of interactive dialog. We find that each brings different technical skills and interpretations of the road to Canterbury: ---  --- U.S. Army Sergt. Bob Johnson (U.S. Sergeant John Sweet) on his way to Canterbury mistakenly gets off in the hamlet of Kent. He is accused of having his stripes on upside down. ---  --- British Sgt. Peter Gibbs (Dennis Price) is temporarily stationed at Kent while staging for overseas. He was and theater organ player before the war. ---  --- Alison Smith (Sheila Sim) a London store clerk before the war is now seeking a job as a `Land Girl'. She seems to have an uncanny knowledge of Kent and the Pilgrims' road to Canterbury. ---  --- The night they got off the train at Kent they had a strange encounter with the mysterious "Glue Man".  Then befriended by the local magistrate, Thomas Colpeper, JP (Thomas Colpeper, JP). Mr. Colpeper is interested in the history of the Pilgrims' Road from Kent to Canterbury. ---  --- Until you get pretty much through this story you are never really sure where they are trying to take you.  Is the focus on a local mystery? The interaction of the players or the lives of the characters themselves? ---  --- -------------------------------------------------------------------- --- Be sure to get the Criterion version with the second DVD. The main item besides the film is the voice over commentary by film historian Ian Christie which will rival the film for entertainment and after watching you may want to give the film that other star.	pos
great flats! Compact and small for those who have too many shoes already. The only thing with these shoes are the elastic part starts hurting the back of my my foot, but only happens if you wear them for a long period of time.	pos
Old Spice is a great-smelling cologne and I've worn it for years. My dad wore it when I was growing up and I remember he almost always smelled of it. It's a great cologne for lean, athletic guys who love retro; it's been around for decades and is a classic for masculine men. It takes a certain type of guy to pull off wearing the stuff. The smell really draws attention to a guy so he better keep his body hard and fit if he wants that type of attention, otherwise he'll just be annoying. Old Spice Cologne actually smells better if you let it age in the bottle for a long time; exposing it to heat helps to age it (leave a bottle in the car or attic in the summertime or outside in your tool building). Trust me, it smells awesome if you let it age. I meant to rate this a five star but hit the wrong toggle. I'm proud to say I'm carrying on the tradition of wearing Old Spice cologne. It's  not nerdy and it's not just for older men. It's a cologne for any masculine guy. It smells great	neg
Whenever people hear of Sofia Coppola they think of 2 things: her much-maligned performance in Godfather III, and her famous dad Francis Ford Coppola, director of the Godfather films and Apocalpyse Now. The latter is particular fodder for nepotism remarks, although it's not as if her dad has made some stellar movies lately. "Jack" anyone? Well this film and her next film Lost in Translation should tip the scale on her favor as she's quite perfect for this kind of material. ---  --- The 5 Lisbon Sisters live extremely sheltered lives thanks to their over-protective parents, in particular their mother. After one of them commits suicide, a boy starts liking one of them prompting to bring some friends to meet the rest. An infatuation develops and pretty soon they start getting into something that when it's over, they still don't know how to make sense of it. ---  --- One of the things that can sometimes happen with a film like this is that in order to explain the story, certain characters moments have to be dropped or just never filmed. While I'm certainly not faulting the film, we're never really invested enough into each girl and who they are. In fact I couldn't actually name them until someone in the film actually did. It's not that big of a knock but it's one thing I noticed. ---  --- Performance-wise it's pretty solid across the board, including Kirsten Dunst and another against-type role for James Woods. Usually very manic, he's quite sedate here which is quite perfect for the dad. There's also the almost unrecognizable Kathleen Turner as the very strict mother and even a quick scene with Danny DeVito and Giovanni Ribisi as the narrator.  ---  --- The DVD definately needs a special edition even though what else could there be to add besides a making-of, deleted scenes and a commentary? Than again Lost in Translation seemed kinda sparse. A commentary on this disc from anyone would've been great, even Francis would've done a great one a kind of critique/overview on his daughter's first film. I mean this guy did do Godfather, surely he could've given a professional's review of this? ---  --- It's hard to say which film's better but this film is quite a good one regardless and proof that one really bad performance doesn't make everything else terrible	pos
Terrible user interface - you must page through tons of cryptic menus to set basic features.  Pulls multiple papers through, so you must start again.  Is a G3, which you would think would be compatible with earlier non-G3 fax machines - WRONG - so you can't fax to 75% of the community that has a non G3 unit!  I thought I was buying quality from Canon when I paid $250 for this hunk of junk!  The cheap Brother and HP's at my work never have these problems and are easier to use, and much less expensive.  Save your money and save the headaches!  Sorry Canon, this product was a disaster	neg
My dad got this for me to supplement a Latin textbook I have been studying for my high school language course. It is quick and easily understandable. You get plenty of words and phrases, which is perfect for a traveler. If you want to learn the language for the sake of knowing it, not travel, however, you'd better get a book to supplement this. It doesn't teach about pluralization, verb conjugation, or other oddities that the language holds, such as, in Latin, the ending -m which implies a direct object. The Latin CD also does not use the dashes over the vowels, which may or may not be necessary, I don't know. Overall, I am very happy with the product and with the price of $39.99 (USD), but I am also quite glad I have my textbook (ECCE ROMANI) to go with it	pos
I love this flash.  I just recently purchased it and have used it for 2 big events and it worked perfectly.  I still don't know everything that it is capable of doing but am still able to work it just fine without even reading the manual. --- I would definitely recommend this flash.	pos
I got this accessory with my Door Gym and I like it.  But, when they say this is an "efficient" accessory - they mean it.  It simply rests on the narrower neutral grip posts of the Door Gym.  The Door Gym has multiple grip areas, but two of them are perpendicular to the rest of the bar for narrow neutral grip chin ups.  The Broad reach bar is wide with downward grips (like lat pull down bar in a gym).   ---  --- Anyway, this works fine if you have the faith to try it the first time and prove to yourself it won't roll off because your body weight has it pinned on the posts. It has foam covering that adheres to the foam on the Door Gym posts. It will not roll easily, but it does a little. I think it is safe for adults who understand how to use it.  Do not give it to kids younger than about 15 (in my estimation) because some of them are too likely to play with, or misuse, it and get hurt. ---  --- Even though this thing works and does what you want a broad bar to let you do, I deducted a point in the rating because I don't think  they were up front in explaining exactly what it is and is not	pos

I ordered a subscription for my step-son and a gift for a niece at the same time.  They took my money and both of the ONE-YEAR subscriptions I paid for only resulted in ONE ISSUE to each child.  I couldn't get any more information on the magazine, as we never received any more informaiton until I got an e-mail from Amazon asking me to renew. ---  --- I noticed another recent post with the same problem.

This was never meant to win an Academy award. It's simply a fun, classic country filled ho-down film with the intent to showcase some of the better country artists of the sixties. The acting is below average, and I wouldn't want it any other way. That's the charm with these two "Hillbilly" films starring Ferlin Husky. It's nostalgia at it's best, and you can bet the farm-fence that I'll be watching this many times again. Forget the Mamie,and Jayne talk; they were a bonus to this classic clunker. They were never meant to steal the show. Pick up "Hillbillys in a Haunted House" too. That one will do a number on you that you're not likely to forget anytime soon	pos
I can't believe that this is considered a "Gourmet Food". In the UK long life UHT milk is an excellent standby when you run out of fresh milk, and it tastes much better than this Parmalat. OK, brands differ and taste is a matter of preference and there are mixed opinions as to whether the UK UHT milk tastes as good as pasturised, but many are just as happy with it as fresh. There is no way that the Parmalat could be mistaken for fresh milk. ---  --- And how expensive. Just add Gourmet to the title and up the price! In the UK it is similar or cheaper than fresh milk. ---  --- I can't understand why it is not more available in the USA.	neg

I first saw this movie on TV as a college student. I loved it so much that an old boyfriend went out and bought it for me on VHS tape. I have watched this movie so many times I'm surprised the VHS tape is still working! ---  --- The actors are perfectly cast in the leads. They are so believeable in their portrayals that I could have gone to high school with them. The kissing scene is HOT. Clothes don't need to come off for you to feel the hot wind of chemistry and passion that blows off that first kiss scene. ---  --- The characters are not glossy, and that is what I love about John Hughes. He portrays coming-of-age in all its naked and truest glory, not the perfect airbrushed schlock that has come out in later years. ---  --- If you're looking to see character development and great plot set to a great soundtrack, this is your type of movie	pos
I made the mistake of ordering this camera to substitute buying a pro camera. The color and noise was terrible. If you want a great point and shoot camera get the Canon powershot s50 while they are still available. The camera has pro features, it was so good they stopped making it because it should have been in the pro camera line at a much higher price tag. If you want to see s50 pictures go to [...] and search my gallery Cathreen Styles. All most all of the pictures in the gallery were taken with the s50. I am going to buy another just to have when mine breaks. By the way, I did end up buy a pro camera, mainly because of the look. I got the Canon 30d and love it	neg
Every Lakers fan I've ever met lives in the past sadly now.  To them, the clock stopped when Kareem and Magic hung up the shoes [and we know why Magic had to leave].  Their basketball knowledge from the 60s to the 90s is rewarding.  After this, however, they don't have a clue of what has happened to this once mighty and moral organization. --- The Lakers have been a good team over the decades [as apparent on this DVD set], but the run of greatness is coming to a LONG slide with Kobe driving the Bus.  The Lakers were once considered the Green Bay Packers of the NFL, but now they're just lucky to even get close to a playoff spot over a majority of the teams in the Western Conference which are much better than the present Lakers. --- I recently attended a game last Fall at the Staples Center, and besides all of the celebs eating hummus in the stands, I could barely hear myself think over Phil Jackson's mantra "I told you so." --- Further illustrating how things have changed in LA, Jack Nicholson has become embarrassed to wear anything purple or yellow. --- So it is understandable that Laker fans would rather focus on the achievements of Magic and Kareem, than rather extol the diminishing skills of Kobe since his Colorado folly.   --- There are some good games on this DVD along with great moments from the Baylor, Chamberlain, West days.  I recommend any Laker fan to purchase this DVD set to relive the past. --- So Laker fans, keep living in the past if you so desire.  Maybe Kobe will retire and become a man of the cloth and lead the Lakers to the NBA Championship promised land once again. --- Long live the Forum [or the Staple Remover Center] or whatever they are calling the Lakers home now	neg

We've had the same set with Christmas colors for three years.  After the first year, the "whistle" unit (housed in the tender) no longer worked.  And about 10 minutes into running the second year, the engine stopped.  Found that the engine was wired so that the power wire was rubbing a drive wheel.   ---  --- The engine is built with an underpowered motor, such that a fairly high power setting is required to get it moving and then it runs fast; there is only a tiny operating range before it will fly off on a curve.  The engine is very top heavy and the curves have a tight radius to them.  Finally, when taking the entire engine apart this year found the plastic gears flimsy, badly supported and worn even with recommended oiling.   ---  --- I still have some of my fathers Lionel trains and these can still be counted on to run today; the new stuff being sold is meant to be in the trash quickly. 	neg
Cross pens are a real favorite and I have one pen with a cat on it that I call my "lucky" pen because I've been writing with it for years and I seem to write better with a cross pen filled with a medium blue refill. The price you pay for the pleasure of smooth writing is that now and then the ink will ball up on the pen tip and you have to "roll" it off onto some paper. I normally find some ink on my hands after using the new refills and the problem may be that I'm writing for so long and the pen has become warm. Even with this issue, the writing seems perfect and the ink is a soft sapphire, easy on the eyes and the pen writes like a dream. I'm writing out all my recipes with these refills and they look wonderful. Writing with a Cross pen always feels a little more luxurious and then pen has lasted for years.  ---  --- ~The Rebecca Review 	pos
Please don't waste your hard earned money on this awful toy. It is tiny! The "hinges" and lock had worn marks on the plastic even before opening the product so you know they will break off soon. The "jewels" never sink, either. ---  --- Interestingly, PoolToy doesn't list the size of this product. In fact they don't give much information at all which is very misleading and disappointing.

I subscribed to this magazine at the same time as the Conte Nast --- Traveler, and I'm going to keep this subscription and let the other one expire.

It's hard to do better than a Weber and this grill has not disappointed in the two years I have owned it.  I use it 3-4 times a week and have cooked just about everything you can imagine on it.  I am very satisfied with its performance, but it has a few minor flaws.  I still have my Genesis series propane grill that is still fine after 12 years, but it was not big enough so I moved up. ---  --- Pros: --- Stainless doesn't rust. --- Large enough to cook a substantial amount using indirect method.  Last night, I simultaneously grilled 4 T-Bones, 10 skewers of tequila-lime shrimp, sweet peppers, and bread.  That's why I wanted this grill.  I need room to cook. --- Insulated box holds the heat well. --- First side burner I've had that actually works. --- Assembly was relatively easy. --- Strong rotisserie motor.  Spin a turkey or 3 chickens; no problem. --- The smoker box w/ its own burner is a great feature. --- Stainless grates are better than any others I have used in past. --- Lots of shelf space w/ fold-down shelves. --- Battery-fired push button starters for all burners is easy and reliable in all weather conditions. ---  --- Cons: --- Expensive.  But I do expect a long service life. --- Gas guzzler.  More than one tank is helpful. --- Couldn't find a cover that fits it.  But it is stainless... --- Gas gauge doesn't work that well, but no biggie. --- The bottom of the cookbox has warped a little resulting in the grates being loose and shifting more than I'd like.  On occasion when cleaning the grates, they will fall into the bottom of the cookbox.  I can work around this and probably fix it without too much trouble, but it does tick me off.  This cost them my 5th star; I expected better. ---  --- So I pretty much love this grill and it's a good thing, because I believe I'll have it for a good long while. ---  --- Chad, the weird chain on the door is for manually lighting the grill.  It is a match holder on a chain attached to the door so you won't lose it.  Go figure	pos
When DVDs came out I thought that CDs were gone.  I thought all bands would start making videos out of all their songs and selling DVDs instead of CDs.  That's what happened with records.  CDs came out and no one released vinyl anymore.  I am so glad that The Sun was the first band to do this.  Every song on this disk is golden.  There ain't a bad song in the bunch.  I heard about this disk on NPR radio.  It seems that it was taking Warner Bros. so long to release the CD that the band made homemade videos for all their songs.  The record company heard about this, watched the videos and said, that's cool, here is some more money, go and make the videos professionally and we will release it as a DVD, like it was a new idea or something.  I talked with my buddies and most of them also thought this should have been done a long time ago.  Another thing that is way cool is the audio tracks.  All the songs are on the disk in .wav form too so that you can put it in your computer and tell Windows Media Player or whatever you use to put it on a regular CD and play it in your car or convert them into MP3s.  There is even a sticker on the shrink wrap encouraging you to convert the .wav files. --- I could go on and on about how much I love this disk.  I played it for my wife, kids, coworkers and they all loved it.  Like other reviewers said, The Sun is a new classic.  Keep it up boys.	pos

I bought it on Amazon a few days ago (I saw the movie a long time ago but just now bought it) and got it today. The movie is awesome. Nick Nolte and Martin Short make an awesome team. The story is probably the best part of the entire movie. It's about an ex-con named Lucas (Nick Nolte) who just gets out of jail and immediately gets involved in a bank robbery commited by Ned (Martin Short). There are so many funny scenes on here. Here are the funniest ones: --- 1. They think Ned (Martin Short) is giving birth (he stuck a teddy bear up his shirt to make it look like he was pregneant) --- 2. When Doctor Horvath (Kenneth McMillan) gives his story about Lucas (Nick Nolte) (tells about the "hunting accident") --- And there are a few more. There is even a bit of Drama in the movie, most of it involving Ned's daughter, Meg (Sarah Rowland Doroff). This movie is perfect. I recommend it to everyone. If you haven't seen it yet, you must see it now. Because if you don't, you're missing out	pos
 --- I really love this system and find it has met all my needs.  My son receives only breastmilk and this system has made it SO easy to express, store, and feed him with a bottle. ---  --- I have not found the liner cost to be a problem.  Nor was I disturbed by how many kits I needed to buy.  I think I bought 5 or 6 to make sure I had enough.  It just depends on how much you're going to need to store.  But you don't need many actual bottles, since the milk doesn't have to be stored in them, so the price evened out for me.  Besides, it's much cheaper than buying formula! ---  --- I also don't care about exact measurements of how much my son eats.  I can get the measurement just by lifting the liner out and taking a look.  But when he's at the breast, I don't know how much he's eaten, so I don't track just how much he has from the bottle, either.  I just make sure he has enough dirty diapers. ---  --- I find the system easy to use because I can express directly into a liner, put the bottle into the freezer, then remove the liner from the bottle when it's frozen.

I cant understand how anyone can give this album more than one star.  Luckily I got this cd for free when they were handing them out to everyone who came to their shows on their 2005 tour.  I love classic Journey, but this band has gone downhill faster than I ever thought possible.  Most of the songs are terrible-boring music and even worse lyrics.  'Arrival' was pretty mediocre, but this is about 5 steps DOWN from there.  Granted, Steve Augeri does complete justice to the old songs in concert and really sounds great, but he obviously has nothing to offer in the way of songwriting.  The only way this band will ever create quality new music is if Perry were to stop sitting around at home and come back to the band.  Otherwise, the band should seriously consider not making any more new music and just go on tour every couple of years	neg
 This was o.k. Nothing more nothing less. This album was hard to review, beacuse no songs really stick out. I mean the guy is a mediocre artist with mediocre rhymes, laced over just above mediocre beats. I have heard better Sesame Street singalongs for yappy kids in the back seat of a mini van.  ---  I mean what does the album have that sticks out? "Saturday To Saturday"? "Bloody Horseshoe"? Or the multi- faceted "Boo, We Ain't Forgot About You" None of the above, or none on the album. ---  --- Sorry. And please, all angry people who think that this is a bad review, remember, it's a REVIEW. I can say what I want	neg

I had been using a spring scale for years and it was fine until I went to a friend's house and saw what I was missing. I put that scale on my wish list that day. This is a lightweight , fairly compact  scale with "on/off" "tare" and "grams/ozs." buttons. it has a clear, plastic,removable bowl for measuring and says it can weigh up to about 3lbs. and down to 1/4 oz. I like it for its slim design its ease of use and for its easy clean up	pos
This was a very interesting movie.  A friend told me to watch this movie after I told him that I really liked the movie The Skeleton Key.  I think I liked The Skeleton Key better... but this was still a really good movie.  There are a few scenes with nudity in it.  Not a movie for the youngsters. We had to stop the movie a couple times to talk about it and at the end my husband was the only one who guessed how it was going to end.  A good movie if you want a movie that keeps you guessing	pos
I'm always skeptical of "age defying" products, but this one really works.  I've been using it since it first came out (maybe 10 years?) and people often think I'm younger than I am (27).  I'm not really using it for that though - I use it because it is unreal how good it is with acne.  It prevents breakouts and also heals current pimples SO fast.  When I run out, the breakouts are back	pos

I've had two Skagen Watches and have to say they are my favorite. I love the large face and the Titanium bracelet (you don't have to remove the watch in order to shower!). A lot of people have complimented me on the watch, too. Given the price and quality, you can't go wrong. If you ever need a part replaced, you just send it to Skagen; the work is completed in a couple of weeks! In summary: an elegant watch at a reasonable price	pos

I had two new fully operational G5 computers with Panther operating system already factory installed.  I was contacted by Apple that a new Operating system was available, faster, yada yada yada. --- I took the two computers into the store and purchased the new operating system Tiger. --- The software proceeded to completely destroy both hard drives on both computers. --- I returned them and told them I wanted my mony back. They refused since the software was oipened but agreed to replace the corrupted software and install it for free. --- The computers never worked right since. --- We were forced to continue working with these crippled computers as we have deadlines to meet.  It was a nightmare --- as it took four times the normal time to do the work because of crashes etc.  We were already out a week with down time due to their negligence. --- When the smoke cleared we took them back in and asked them to take the operating system Tiger out and replace the computers with the original operating system.  Another four hours standing in line. --- We got them back to the office and low and behold they still did not work. We took them back again and were told by a snotty tech that we had dust in the computer as if that's what the cause has been all along. He told us never to come in with dust in the computer again even though the dust was in areas that we are not allowed into without breaking the warranty. --- If this were the case why hasn't it been a problem for the past 12 years? and what am I supposed to do? only use the computer in an operating room?  The dust he displayed was extremely minimal the computer was only six months old and if it were such a problem why didn't the other four techs working on the computers notice it and clean it the first four times they had it on their bench?   --- Bottom line.. I'm tired of buying new programs and computers that don't work. Tired of standing in line for hours. Tired of companies not having a complaint line. How handy is that? No wonder they keep saying your the first one that's had a problem with this.  That's literally impossible since I work in the entertainment indusrty that deals with editing and service bureaus that operate 100s of computers.  They all are avoiding Tiger because of known problems as well.  Apple is not addressing this and hundreds if not thousands of businesses are losing valuble production time due to their negligence. Instead of trying to develope a way for my daughter to dock her I-pod to a bowling ball, they should concentrate on making operating systems work in their computers. --- Total time lost in our company is at least a week which is in dollars around 20,000.00. I can't imagine how much is being lost nation wide. Something needs to be done about this.  They need to be held accountable for the destruction they cause by distributing faulty product.To add salt to the wound they keep coming up with all these stupid ideas on why the computers are not running right after they destroyed them initially. There comes a time that if they can't fix them, they need to replace them and stop wasting the consumers time and costing them money.  We need a lemon law that applies to computers.  Then the manufacturers will make sure they function before they are sold. I know I can't get the money my business had lost back but I want them held accoutable for distribution of a faulty op and replace the computers they can't fix instead of sending me back to the office with inoperable computers	neg
Very well-thought design. I just wished I looked up at the pictures on here again before I pushed my 8525 in without sliding out the keyboard first. I thought it was weird. But after I looked at the pictures again.. man.. how brilliant! They should've provided some sort of User Guide on how to put the case on. And the leather is of a very high quality too. The seller is awesome, very Amazon-like shipping (i.e. fast)	pos
The main character came across as gay to me too. This movie is in no way realistic. The other reviewer is right about everything. It's a really cheap movie made by amateurs using plastic toy guns, the actors jerk the guns to make them look like they have a kick. The "martial arts" in the movie are weak and sloppy, there's no way that crap would actually work in real life. I don't even know why I bothered to watch the whole thing, I guess I just found the stupidity amusing. The cover makes it look like it would be a cool movie, unfortunately that's the only thing they put much effort into. I rented it from Block Buster too, they need to burn it. This movie looks like some kind of a high school project or something, like they had to make a movie to pass drama class	neg

The music of Dowland is wonderful - but Sting isn't up to interpreting it. You can't even distinguish the words half the time, just a jumble of nice sounds from his pretty tenor - he doesn't possess the skills to carry it off. This music has to be interpreted by someone with an ability to express thoughts in heightened language...Sting, for all his merits, hasn't got that in his repertoire yet.  ---  --- It's an exercise in pretention, laughable at times. The letter reading is ridiculous. I love both Sting's voice and Dowland's song, but this CD is a failure.	neg
The Good: --- When I first heard about this board I was incredibly excited.  I have been playing BF2 (Battlefield 2) for almost a year now and still continually find myself stumbling over the keys. So it was a godsend to be able to purchase something like this directly intended to help me be better at my game.  ---  --- The interchangable keysets for different games and applications is quite intriguing -- the first that I have seen.  But the price for each is kind of high but well worth it. ---  --- The Bad: --- The board is constructed well but don't expect this to replace your home keyboard.  The "Windows Keyset" that comes standard with this board has all the keys as any run-of-the-mill keyboard but it is awkward to type with (I might be biased since I have a MSoft ergonomic split keyboard).  ---  --- In-game typing is difficult at best (with the gaming keysets). With most of the gaming keysets the keys on the left 1/2 of the keyboard are laid out like your home keyboard but on the right 1/2 side they are all vertical (not staggered.. like U,J and M  keys are 90 degrees vertically on top of each other). The keys feel a little "cheap" .. When you push them down they don't bounce back as much. ---  --- The Ugly: --- About 2 weeks after I purchases this board (and the BF2 keyset) 9 keys went completely dead.  I tried to reinstall the software, reboot and even resinstalled a fresh copy of Windows XP to no avail. ---  --- I contacted support and it has taken us 3 weeks to finally reach the decision that I have a faulty base unit. DUH!  They are "reviewing my warranty" but most likely it will not be covered because it has been longer than 30 day. Maybe this post is premature but I don't think I am getting a new base unit. ---  --- Conclusion: --- The expression "Great Idea, Bad Execution" holds true here. My opinion: Don't buy this board. Ideazon has too many issues, not enough support staff and a website that doesn't do anything but look good	neg

I bought this camcorder 3 months ago and, after using it a grand total of 6 times, it is broken.  It constantly loses track of timestamp on the tape doing things like rewinding 2 minutes (two minutes on the counter in the display), refusing to rewind anymore and telling me the tape is full.  It's a 60 minute tape and it can only record 2 minutes???  I figured that was a problem with the tape so I tried another one, which seemed to work fine until I got home and tried to watch the footage.  The camera counter once again became confused and the whole camera just locked up.  I had to power off and on several times before finally getting the camera to rewind the tape to where I needed it to be.  Lastly, the mechanism for ejecting the tape broke after only one month.      ---  --- One last note, the support for Panasonic is horrible too.  You can't talk to a "real" person and instead have to go through an annoying robotic voice recognization "person".  I'll never buy another Panasonic product again...give me Sony	neg
I purchased these for my fiance to wear for our beach wedding in Puerto Rico.

Not true, the pants were returned, the rest of my order cancelled and I will never purchase anything from this company again	neg
I absolutely love these shoes.  I have a very high arch and I am a hard heel-striker.  Needless to say that finding a comfortable shoe for my difficult feet has been a real chore.  These shoes have plenty of cushion in the heel and yet also support my arches.  However, I did put an extra arch support insert in (did I mention I have really high arches?) but didn't get the usual "crowding" effect which was wonderful. I've bought lots of shoes that were supposed to be right for my type of foot but after running in them had to eventually give them away.  These shoes were honestly perfect right out of the box, I've been walking/jogging/running in these babies for over a month now with no problems whatsoever. I plan on buying several pairs of these before somebody decides to "improve" them and changes something.  Boy do I hate it when I finally find a shoe I like and then the company decides to 'improve it' and screw up a really great shoe (bitter much? gee not me)   --- I also received the shoes in less than a week and that is a miracle where I live.  Good service all around.  Hope this helps someone else.	pos

I could barely get through the...um...er...reimagination...of the childern's classic - while the set design and special FX are state of the art, as usual for a Tim Burton film, the actual movie is hard to watch. Why? Depp's "performance" is chock full of ticks and mannerisms, off-putting, flat, self-absorbed, and finally, one-note. Rather than the quirky fun of the original 1972 Gene Wilder version, Burton's film is more horror than fantasy, often casually cruel and sadistic to the point of being far from family fare.  While deliberate on Burton's part, that doesn't make the final product any more watchable. It's one grim, dismal, downward spiral slog. Not much holidday fun, huh? As with most of Burton's other big, expensive failures, he knows how to CREATE a convincing world, but has no clue how to POPULATE it with characters and situations we identify with and/or could care less about.  The final result is a film that's like a fragile, hermetically sealed curio on the shelf - nice to look at from afar, but hard to get attached to, much less involved with. What a waste of millions of studio $$$	neg
This movie is very mildly amusing for about ten minutes.  Yes, it is slightly interesting to see the Cannes environment, but not enough to watch this film. It could be a cure for insomnia, though.  Fans who are looking forward to seeing their favorite actors in a satire will be disappointed.  You can count in seconds the amount of time any famous actor is on the screen, and it's really just very boring. All those fans of Johnny Depp: be particularly warned. He may have co-star billing, but blink and you'll miss him	neg
This is a must-have item if you want to add the Clock Tower to your set.  It also works well with the other "elevation" sets, particularly Mile High Mountain. ---  --- The set includes the following: ---  --- 4 ramps (these are made from two shorter pieces that are screwed together) --- 2 curves --- 2 short straights --- 2 guard rails --- 2 end ramps --- 8 arches (2 supports and 1 crosspiece each) ---  --- The crosspieces of the arches have a picture of how the ends of the track should be aligned.  The screws are a little tough but never need to be removed.  The set is enough to run up two full levels and back down again (my son has played with this set just by itself having fun running up, around and racing back down).  You can also make two single-level bridges, a single level bridge and a ramp down from Mile High Mountain, or many other setups. ---  --- This set literally adds a new dimension to a Geotrax set.  Lots of fun.  The short pieces also allow for different configurations that may have been frustrating in the past.  Definitely fun.	pos

Ernest Hemingway dies on page 161 of this 300-page book and so does author Valerie Hemingway's story. For that reason this book merits only two stars. Early in her story of meeting Hemingway in Spain in 1959 at age 19, Valerie is aware of the author's magnetic and dominant personality, "Around him everything came to life....There was an urgency and vitality that...did not ebb." ---  --- When she stays focused on the story of Ernest Hemingway, this is an endearing look at the older, struggling Hemingway finding temporary renewal in the freshness of an innocent Irish girl who entered his life during the final drafts of "A Moveable Feast." ---  --- But the youthful time spent with the famous writer works against this memoir since she was clearly neither as dedicated a correspondent or note taker as her subject. As a result, her recollections are thin and easily available in other sources such as A. E. Hotchner's "Papa Hemingway." The two years she spent living and traveling with Hemingway through Spain, Paris, Key West, Cuba, and America, share as much space as her weird marriage with Hemingway's strange son, Gregory (apparently the other "bull" referred to in the title).  ---  --- It shows the continuing vitality of Ernest Hemingway - even in death and over 40 years later - that a Valerie Hemingway can find a book deal for her meager remembrances of such a great man	neg

There is so much to see and discover in this game. It took me over 70 hours just to complete the walkthrough and I am still working on capturing all the monsters for the Monster Arena. Someone who wanted to complete all side quests, find all special items, etc. could easily spend more than 100 hours on this game and never get bored -just incredibly deep gameplay. The graphics are also outstanding, among the best I have seen in a video game. It took me awhile to get used to the Sphere Grid used to increase your characters' stats. At first I didn't find it as satisfying as the typical method of "leveling up". But eventually I began to enjoy it and it's now one of my favorite aspects of the game. The only thing I found tiresome was how long the cutscenes were. The storyline itself was quite good. But I wish it was told with shorter cutscenes or at least gave players the option to skip through the cutscenes. Still this is a minor complaint to an otherwise excellent game. Definitely worth buying!	pos

I heard that this grill was "only" 36000 btu, and was not as hot as some other grills.  Believe me, this puppy is plenty hot if all you are going to do is cook food!  Disregard this btu rating.  This btu rating is rubbish.  This grill will transfer so much heat to your food so fast that if you're not used to cooking with a high-quality grill you will turn your beautiful porterhouses into charchol (I used a custom-cut 3-inch porter house to break in my new grill, and to my surprise, it was closer to well done than I prefer, but still DELICIOUS!)  Everything is high-quality.  It is much more solid than all the other grills I looked at, and the grill is very even in terms of heating.  Besides, it is beautiful.  The side burner was not something I was really interested in, but I just went for it.  I used it the first time.  THIS is the grill you need	pos

I bought this for my husband. We tried it in one car and it kept getting stuck in the lighter socket and the end kept coming off (it wasn't screwed very tightly and couldn't be screwed tighter). In the other car it fit in the socket all right but every couple of minutes you had to adjust the radio station and even then the music came through fuzzy. Also, if you turned the car off it doesn't remember which station it was tuned to. We are going to return it to Amazon, but I'm not sure how as I don't think they have an option for returning it as 'the product just isn't very good!' If you want something cheap and are ok with it not being particularly reliable then this is for you, but for hardcore music lovers, I suggest savinf up and investing in a better product.	neg
This is the worst holiday movie in America! I mean if you buy this product you'll face torture (as in singing horribly.) Making friends as the movie says is not the most important thing in the world in my belief. They also said that "If you want, wish for fairy tales and it will come true." Right.

To start off i am a huge grateful dead fan and i have prabably about 150 cd's that cover many years of there carrer.

Bridal Guide is a lengthy magazine designed to appeal to brides in waiting and to those women who see marriage on the horizon. This magazine is devoted to bridal fashion and to other things that are involved in making the day special and memorable. Besides the fashion, one can read about wedding planning, honeymoon ideas, photography, and other wedding- related things.  ---  --- When you read a copy of Bridal Guide, what stands out more than anything are the photos. This is the main reason people read this magazine in the first place: To look at wedding attire and compare different styles. Models wearing wedding gowns are abundant in this publication and some of the bridal gowns they adorn are quite stunning. To help future brides make a possible purchase, it is common to find a phone number and/or a web site with the majority of the photos. Bridal attire is the main focus of this magazine, but there are also some pictures of grooms and of other wedding party members, with models displaying other fashions for sale, once again complete with phone number and web page.  ---  --- The part of this magazine that focuses its attention on honeymoons and travel is probably my favorite part of the issue. What I like is the fact that this is one part of the magazine that can appeal/apply to anyone, regardless of marital status. These honeymoon tips and destination information provide some good reading material for the bride to be or anyone else who happens to read the magazine.  ---  --- Bridal Guide is a very lengthy publication, with each issue containing around 500 pages! This is more than double the length of most other magazines and it can make the issue seem a little overwhelming at times. Also, this magazine is saturated with ads. Since the majority of the gown- clad models are, in effect, advertisements for a specific fashion brand, one can expect to find ads covering the vast majority of this magazine's pages. This could be annoying to some, but one must bear in mind that the magazine's focus is wedding planning, so excessive advertising is expected.  ---  --- For young brides- to- be or bridal wannabes, this is a handy magazine to have around. It's very long, but it contains lots of fashion and wedding planning ideas to make the big day one to remember forever. 	pos

I love these nuts, I stock up on them whenever I can find them in the grocery store, now that Amazon is carrying them I can stock up whenever I go on a nut hunt.

I have been a subscriber to Family Fun for 4+ years and I have always enjoyed the magazine.  I don't remember ever being disappointed in an issue.   ---  --- I usually will read a magazine once just for entertainment value and then go back later and sort out the articles & ideas I want to keep on file for future reference.  In most magazines this equates to a few pages to hang on to at the most.  With Family Fun I always end up with a huge stack of ideas that I want to hang on to.  What is even better is that these are tips and bits of information that I actually use and apply in our everyday lives.  Practical, useful and fun are all words I would use to describe this publication. ---  --- My favorite features include:  --- "My great idea" - submitted by readers --- "Family Almanac" - seasonal activities and resources --- and the travel ideas.  We have discovered many great places that our on our list to visit someday and we have even been able to add some wonderful and educational fun to trips we have already had planned. ---  --- Some reviews have complained about the magazine being owned by Disney.  I'm not sure why that is such a problem, but I do realize some people don't like Disney.  The truth is that some major corporation owns just about everything major magazine out there anyway.  At least the Disney company has helped Family Fun gain a bigger audience and provided a fantastic web site as a resource companion to the magazine.  I don't find that Disney is overly promoted (a rarity in the world of Disney I know!) in this magazine.  There are plenty of reviews and references to very non-Disney products such as the Harry Potter series, Shrek movies, and hundreds of travel ideas that have nothing to do with anything related to a Disney enterprise. ---  --- This magazine has definitely earned the 5 star rating	pos
I have used every diaper in the market and narrowed it down to pampers and huggies, I have a big 21 month old baby and been looking for the perfect night time diaper with no leaks!! My son still fits in the size % diapers but this is the one we specifically use at night and been really happy about it, no leaks, no gel coming out of the diaper and defintely a happy baby when he wakes up in the morning!	pos
This movie classic, is a fabulous movie.  The story represents a common dilemma faced by 1st generation young people whose parents are immigrants. --- Here is this sensitive, kind-hearted fellow, Marty, a butcher, who just wants to meet a nice girl and get married. Nobody really wants him to be happy and have his own life, especially his mother, and his aunt.  These two actors play their character parts perfectly, just like real "battle-axes" from the "old country,"  etc.  They gossip and try to ruin his relationship with a nice girl he has just met. It is hilarious and entertaining and very true to life.  I love watching this movie over and over	pos
I've been a fan of Carol Dweck's scholarly work for years. Her work on self-esteem, self-concept, and the incremental vs. entity theories of intelligence provides some of the most powerfully useful tools I've encountered for educators and parents in their work with children, as well as in their own self-awareness and lives. I'm delighted to see this information written here in such a user-friendly conversational tone, rich with stories that illustrate the nuances and complexities of Dweck's research and ideas. I'm recommending this book to all of my graduate students (teachers and principals working with gifted learners), as well as to parents of high-ability children. ---  --- Dona Matthews, Ph.D., Director of the Hunter College Center for Gifted Studies and Education, City University of New York	pos
My 15 month old daughter received this as a gift, and I have to admit she loves it, but it has nothing to do with the product design. She would love any toy shopping cart at this stage. She just loves pretend cooking, eating, and feeding her baby doll.  ---  --- This toy is so shoddily made it's laughable. Some of the included foods to put in the cart are actually just cardboard boxes that wind up torn and in the garbage within the first 48 hours. The cart basket is too small, the baby gets stuck in the seat, and my daughter gets frustrated when parts of the cart fall off as she plays. It's not going to last long. The best parts are the little milk carton and the banana. ---  --- Check out other shopping cart toys (little tykes or small world toys).  We bought her a set of wooden fruit (melissa and doug). When this shopping cart dies, we'll buy her a sturdy one and add more wooden food toys (there are some excellent sets available). My advice is skip this one and buy your child something better the first time around	neg
I was interested in Dante's thoughts on hell, religion, and the afterlife as taught by the Catholic church at the time of its writing.  What I got was a detailed political history of Medieval Italy.  This book is great for the first few chapters, but then it becomes a repetitive saga.  Synopsis of the each chapter of the Inferno: Go to next layer of hell; describe in 20 words or less the torture found there; make fun of some political opponents, Catholic church officials, and so forth; prepare for further descent.  In my opinion, this book resides somewhere between the 21st and 22nd layers of hell.  Canto three pretty much has it right.... 'Leave all hope, ye that enter	neg

Oh! How I will never forget seeing the re-release of this film. --- It was in 1974 and I could not keep my eye's from it.It is now --- 2006 and I still can't.What this movie is to me is a place in --- my heart and being a avid collector of films from the silents --- to the classics and obscure I find that very meaningful.If you --- have not seen 7th you are missing out. It truly is a funtastic --- film.I put this above Jason and the argonauts for my reason --- alone(I KNOW I STAND ALONE IN THIS FOR JASON HAS MORE  --- monsters and the great Ray Harryhausen has said JASON --- is his fav.along with many of his fans).What 7th has above --- Jason for me is MUSIC! A soundtrack to a film has always --- been a extra push to a film and the 7th voyage has that --- extra push on Jason.Bernard Herrman's score is so dreamlike --- you can close your eyes and leave 7th on and the music is  --- trancelike especially the snake woman dance.Please anyone --- who reads this have 7th voyage in your collection(Jason --- & the argonauts too for that matter).You wont be dissapointed --- I will always be grateful to have seen this on the big screen --- and never forget it,I hope when you watch Ray Harryhausen's --- children and Bernard Herrman's music come to life you too --- will not forget it.Some say Gone with the wind,Wizard of Oz --- Casablanca,Citizen Kane,Jaws, Star Wars(77), Superman(78) --- E.T. Titanic,2001 a space & Pulp Fiction.Not me! If I was --- on a island and could only have one film from my library --- (ouch!I have alot of films and alot I love)but I would --- have to pick The Seventh Voyage.That would be the one  --- for me on the island.And please let it be the isle of --- colossus. --- 	pos

I liked this movie when i first saw it and i seen it about 10 times... i like to watch any movie that involves gangs (especially bloods & crips) so i can learn from them... ---  --- If you're looking or are just a collector like me of gang movies... you may not want this one in your collection... becuase to me, it doesn't show enough Bloods & Crips in it.... the characters are fictional....there are some minor gangs in it as well called The White Fences (Latino/Hispanic gang - i've never heard of this gang, so i don't know if they are true or not.). ---  --- The actors who play the gang members of the White Fences are good actors though... i think they are better then Don Cheadle and Wayans who play Crip members... this movie centers more on White Fence and their rivalry w/ Crips... there's not too much focus on Bloods in here... it also more focuses on Sean Penn's character and Robert Duvall too (good cop/bad cop), and Penn on how he falls in love w/ a former gangmember woman in the White Fence gang. ---  --- Colors is a good watch...i just wish it had more gang focus in it...and more gang sets (chapters, i.e. Eight Tray Gangsters, Hoover, etc...) If you're looking for a good gang buy, buy the book "Monster" by Sanyika Shakur a.k.a. Monster Kody Scott, or "Do Or Die" by Leon Bing. Those 2 books far surpasses this movie..	pos

My son is 5 months old now and for the first 4 months, the monitor worked pretty well.  We got a bit of static from time to time, but I would have given it 4 stars.  BUT...one night I woke up to reassure myself with the little green "on" light and saw that the monitor was not on.  Thinking it was a fluke, I turned it back on, checked the baby and went to bed.  But, over the course of a couple of weeks, it became more and more unreliable, turning off at will.  It was also hard to turn it back on.  I had to flip the switch several times before it would work. And, this is not a battery issue, since it was plugged in the entire time. I went to the Evenflo website and read the FAQs.  There's a mention of a problem with the power light going out, but nothing about the monitor itself going out.  Needless to say, we've thrown it away and have gotten a different brand.  I mentioned this to my friend with an 8 month old the other day and she said the same exact thing happened to hers - just stopped working reliably. She's bought a different monitor too.  Both of our new monitors are working perfectly now with less static.  I wouldn't recommend purchasing this monitor until they make some changes.	neg
Shaving gives me all sorts of problems, I must have super sensitive skin or something. I cannot afford laser and wax just isn't my thing.  --- Grabbed this for myself before Christmas on a whim. It was money well spent! --- After 3 months of use, I have gotten the hang of the product. I suggest you practise then shave regularly for a month or more. Say, run the product over each leg once till you get used to it. Then trying to completely remove the hair. My legs are unbelievably soft. No rash, one little tender area after I spent too much time there. Do keep moving and keep a razor in the cabinet just in case. I still have trouble around my ankles. --- Hair regrowth is markedly thinner since I began using it. By about half.

After the incredible "Monkey Island" series was halted, I feared that I would never find another series of games that had such imaginative storylines, entertaining dialogue, and lush scenery. Then "Bully" came along, and I was hooked. This really is a great game, and you shouldn't be set against it because it's really nothing at all like Grand Theft Auto. There's no blood, no sexuality (except for kissing), and there's so many involving and engrossing storylines. The characters are also some of the best I've ever seen, each having their own stories and personality. The whole clique thing also reminds you of your days in high school. GET BULLY-- IT'S AN AWESOME GAME. People who like this game should also look at the "Monkey Island" series of games for PC and PS2, and the "Nancy Drew" series for PC	pos

If you have always wanted a turn based strategy game in a fantasy setting with no limits then Dominions II is really the only option out there. Its not perferct but its darn good. ---  --- The story, if you can really call it that, is that the world of Dominions once had one god. One day he just wasn't there all of a sudden and everybody and their brother decided to try and apply for his job. All of these "pretender gods" have to kill off all the other gods and put their religions out of commision in order to take over the world and become a true god. To start up a new game of Dominions II you need to choose from one of the 17 different empires and then pick your pretender god from dozens of different avatars. You can play as darn near anything you can imagine from the ordinary, like the arch-mage, to the outrageously exotic, like the fountain of blood. Every pretender god has strengths and weaknesses and some may be adept at only one or two paths of magic while others may learn many with ease. You also pick a castle and set up your own "dominion" which is the effect your god has on his followers as his religion spreads across the world.  ---  --- But that isn't all, you still haven't actually started a game yet. Next you have to create the game by picking from one of nearly a dozen huge maps and setting all of the game settings such as victory conditions and the difficulty of neutral provinces. And lets not forget, you also choose which of the 17 empires will be playing and if they will be human or AI players. ---  --- The game itself is huge and has very few limits. Your empires unique units may be built in any province in which you have built a castle but every proince in the game also has its own units that may be built there to inculde many that none of the empires usually have access to. Plus units may be equiped with different armor and weapons and as such there may well be hundreds of unique units in the game with maybe even thousands of different equipment varaitions. Like the pretender gods, units come in a huge array from simple, like the light infantry, to the wild, like werewoles and vampires. Combine that with the fact that there are hundreds of spells in the game to research, hundreds of magic items to forge and find, and random events almost every turn, no two games will ever end the same way and the game has nearly unlimited replyability. ---  --- Combat is a bit unsual. All units, in order to move around the map or attack, have to be assigned to a commander. Commanders are built in the same way you recruit normal units but they can only lead so many men. However, you can assign units under a commander to as many squads as you like and each squad as well as the commander himself can be issued a specific order such as casting spells, using ranged weapons or attacking certain foes on the battle field. The downside of all this is that you have to set up all of this before hand during your turn. Combat occours in between turns and you have no control over the battle. Its entirely up to your units to follow the plan you laid out for them.For better or worse this system is certainly original. ---  --- But some things about the game really bother me. My biggest complaint with the game has to be the computer AI. Its not thats its too stupid or too smart. Its actually a bit like the terminator, it allways seems to know where you are and sends wave after wave of seemingly endless foes after you. It can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargined with and it won't stop until one of you is dead. With no diplomacy options and units like spys, assassins and scouts being extremely rare and expensive most games aginst the AI just deteroiate into massive rushing attacks with huge armies killing each other over and over with gods throwing spells at each other turn after turn. ---  --- Another problem with the game is the manual which is huge but contains no information that isn't easily available in the game. Its the same problem Evil Genius had, the manual is awful and all the hints that should hae been in the manual are hidden in the games loading screens. I hope you can read fast. The grapics obviously aren't exactly on par with Half Life 2 or Doom 3 but they work, however I've got to take issue with the music and sound which is downright AWFUL. You better get used to hearing the same three music tracks over and over.  ---  --- Over all, Dominions II is by far the best turn based fantasy game I've ever played. Room for improvement is obviously here but this game should keep you occupied for a long time	pos

After slogging through a number of these reviews it is clear that most cannot see that we Twenty-First Century Americans were not the intended audience for this movie. The movie was intended to be a unifying morale-builder for the National Socialist Party in Germany, which had been in power only about a year when this movie was made.  ---  --- From its loss of World War I until the NSDAP was elected to power in Germany in 1934, the people had suffered every kind of internecine mob warfare, illegal abuse and theft of whole portions of Germany at the hands of the French, and an economic catastrophe that made our American Depression look like a picnic by comparison.  ---  --- This movie sought to persuade Germans (GERMANS!) that this dreadful misery was finally over and that the criminal Bolshevik traitors responsible for Germany's defeat in World War I, and all the residual woes, would be defeated once and for all. It must have been a most welcome message because as you watch the film you certainly don't get the impression that anyone had to beg the many thousands of Germans who attended the NSDAP rallies to stand up and cheer their hearts out.  ---  --- If you speak and understand German, you'll have a much greater likelihood of being able to understand the impact of these rallies, and this film that celebrates them. For many who are not conversant in the German language or who know little about the actual history of the time besides what they were exposed to in American World War II films, the film is actually pretty boring after a while.   ---  --- You sit there and watch one group of soldiers, police, or workers after another, marching and marching and marching. This is interspersed with speeches by Hitler and the other Party officals. From time to time you'll see interesting-looking people doing everyday things, some in costume, but mostly they're just talking, walking, eating, brushing their teeth, and so on. Be advised -- for those of you who expect the whole thing to be a stirring, gigantic SS parade with weapons bristling, be prepared to be disappointed. The last group of soldiers on parade are indeed the SS Leibstandarte Adolph Hitler, and they're marching to what was reputedly Hitler's favorite piece -- "Der Badenweiler". Remember to notice that they aren't even carrying rifles or bayonets.... ---  --- Lastly, in my opinon, the commentary by "historian" Dr Anthony Santoro is mostly just another sarcastic, demeaning rant against the people in the film, so typical of those who pronounce judgement on the vanquished after every war.  The marching soliders and other Germans who reverberated such thrills of hope for their poor, beleagured country are all long dead, but Santoro must make fun of them for the amusement (?) of the American audience. Try to remember -- this movie was not made for YOU!	pos

This gauge works well and is easy to read. It seats well and does mostly what it should. --- There seems to be a lot of misunderstanding from what I have read in other reviews. Let's clear a few things up. --- First of all, you do NOT have to wait ten seconds between readings. You DO have to hit the recall button on the bottom between readings. --- Secondly, you DO NOT have to send the unit back to replace the batteries. The instructions VERY clearly state the model number of user replaceable batteries (if you were to read the instructions). --- The hose was flexible for me in 30 degree weather contrary to what I have read elsewhere. Maybe it gets stiff in really cold weather but then I use mine in the garage. ---  --- Very Nice Gauge	pos
I've been using this since the first beta release, and it has sped up my productivity at work by miles.  The ribbon interface is more upfront with the commands most ofter used, and my old keystroke commands are still there as well.  After changing my default save setting to 97-2003 I have run into no compatibility problems.   ---  --- As with most of the bad reviews on MS products, it seems people are quick to rush with a bad review when they are unable to find or do something as quickly as they have in the past.  My advice is to spend ten minutes looking through all of the menus...  They make sense, and once you get used to it, you'll never want to go back to the old way again.  Everything is cleaner, smoother, faster, and easier to use than ever before, and I have been using Office for longer than I care to admit.  Let go of the past people!  This is the future of business productivity	pos
Graphics aren't the most important part of a game to me.  I already owned Oblivion when I bought Gothic 2 because I was hoping it would be a darker and more mature "Oblivion" style RPG. ---  ---   While it does have much more mature content than Oblivion,.. I never got to see it because of the bad controls,.. bad collision and lack of fun.  (By bad collision I'm talking about your character walking through or getting stuck on objects.) ---    The only weapons you can find at first are a tree branch and a tiny dagger.  There are no easy enemies to fight for a Level 1 character.  Even the little gremlin looking guys in the first cave by that pond at the beginning totally beat the crap out of you with ease.  The controls make combat an unfun chore. ---  ---   I'm a patient and forgiving gamer but Gothic 2 barely has half the quality of Elder Scrolls 4 : Oblivion.  If you've never played Oblivion and don't have an XBox 360 or a PC that can run it,.. then maybe you'll get into Gothic 2.  It has much lower system requirements	neg
In many ways a relic of its era, "Not of This Earth" is the first widely distributed release by Joe Satriani (a previous EP ended up being reissued as part of "Time Machine", years later).  The guitarist, supported by drummer Jeff Campitelli and percussionist John Cuniberti came into public attention when Steve Vai, a former student of Satriani, ended up singing his teacher's praises in the music press. ---  --- The result is that this album, more than likely to have been lost in the shuffle of instrumental rock music, received wider recognition and poised Satriani to explode into a bonafide celebrity on his next record. ---  --- The album itself is a bit uneven-- Satriani is a flawlessly brilliant guitarist, but as a songwriter, he wasn't quite ready.  Several pieces ("Not of This Earth", "Hordes of Locusts") seem to run out of steam before they end, and a couple ("The Snake", "Driving At Night") feel like bad '80s metal.  On the other hand, several pieces shine-- delicate and lovely "Rubina", reggaeish and emotionally soaked "Memories", and the overtly Frippesque "New Day" are all fine examples of what Satriani is capable of.  But my favorite is probably "Brother John", where Satriani abandons all his effects and performs his delicate and bubbly melody cleantone. ---  --- In the end, the album is ok, but Satriani would go on to do so much more interesting in the future.  Come back to this one if you've picked up a bunch of other stuff and are looking for more, but most should start with "Surfing With the Alien"	neg
This is a great clock. When I bought it about a week ago, I put the battery in the clock, and placed it on the wall in my family room where my old clock used to be. That was it.

I'm going to the trouble of writing this review to warn you: this cd is not like the other Putumayo cds. No, it is not fun, hip, relaxing, good to dance to, or stimulating.

As a lover of many types of music, this movie sparked my interest....so I rented it.  I found myself thinking throughout the movie "I can't believe I'm actually watching this.  What a waste!"  Not only was the plot slow to the point of boring, but the film exalted lesbianism to the point that I (as a grown woman) actually fast-forwarded through a couple of scenes.  The small amount of goodness in the movie was not worth all of the disappointing twists and turns of the story.  Also, please carefully consider before allowing children to watch!! I will NEVER, under any circumstances watch this movie again. (I want the reader to know that I am in no way a movie critic.  I am writing this strictly as someone who wishes to steer others away from what I found to be a complete waste of an evening.	neg

Pupsqueak is wonderful. I am a picky mother about toys. I hate toys that are too loud, too commercial, too cheesy, too useless...I have high standards. But Pupsqueak gets my "picky mom seal of approval" wholeheartedly. Here's why. ---  --- I am very blessed to have a mother who loves to send my children lots of goodies. While it's easy to know what to send a 4-year-old with distinct likes and interests, it can be harder to gauge what a twelve-week-old baby will enjoy. We have no shortage of toys and gadgets to entertain our new daughter with, and she clearly enjoys some of them, kicking legs, cooing, , waving arms, etc. ---  --- The Pupsqueak, however, took it to a different level. She LOVES this thing. We showed it to her around 11-12 weeks old, and she immediately reacted. She laughed, she kicked, all the signs. Then, she reached for the little black and white patterned bone that hangs down. We were so excited, and she's had it attached to the bar on her carseat ever since. The real test, however, was our 10-hour drive from Louisiana to Kentucky for the Thanksgiving holidays. But Pupsqueak came through for us with flying colors: anytime she would get fussy, I could reach back and shake him a bit so he would jingle softly, and she would be happy again. After my arm would get tired, I'd make sure he was adjusted where she could get at him, and she would, at not yet 4 months, bat at it herself. ---  --- Pupsqueak is a wonderful toy with a soft, gently jingle for young babies and a funny bark that even makes my four-year-old laugh for older babies. He is definitely top dog in my book	pos
My engineering classes don't allow for the TI-83,86,89.  So I needed a calculator that allowed for matrix reduction, basic vector manipulation, and single variable integration for my engineering class.  The matrix reduction capabilities has been a major time saver especially on tests, particularly for solving systems of linear equations especially in my Statics, Dynamics, and Strength of Materials Class.  The "2-Line Natural Textbook Display" prevents me from getting lost in a calculation with multiple parenthetically nested expressions and is a must have.  The "scrolling" ability to grab values from previous calculations saves time and preserves accuracy, very nice.  The only thing preventing a 5 star rating is that I thought the exterior design make is awkward to use at times, but that is because I'm used to square calculators.  Also I would have like this model offered in black	pos
Touchstone features articles, editorials, book reviews and other material from the perspective of Protestant (both mainline and evangelical), Catholic and Orthodox Christians who hold to traditional, orthodox understandings of Christian morality.  It tackles the tough issues of our time both in scholarly articles and practical advice for parents who must raise children to be faithful in a post-Christian culture.  While it does not seek a false ecumenicalism which demands unity at all cost (see the July/August 2003 issue on "Christian Unity & the Divisions we must Sustain"), it also recognizes that orthodox believers of all three major branches of Christianity must work together on moral issues on which we all agree. ---  --- The publisher, the St. James Fellowship, also produces an excellent devotional guide: The St. James Daily Devotional Guide for the Christian Year, available by subscription though [...]	pos
The item is sloppy looking and feeling, unlike the photo of the black Ellaroo.  I didn't feel that the baby was secure and she rode so low on my side that one could hardly call it a hip. Maybe I just never got it adjusted correctly but I read the instructions and gave it many tries.  However, on a positive note, I was refunded my money with no problem.  There was a small restock fee which was disclosed up front.  So, I have no problem with the seller. 	neg
A good friend of mine insisted I'd read this book, because she knows I love exploring the spiritual aspects of life.  ---  --- In the end I was very disappointed.  Not in the writing or the exploration aspects of the book, but Michael Crichton's whole attitude.  He would spend a chapter sharing his learnings and his eye opening experiences, only to revert back to his arrogant, narrow-minded attitude once again for the next chapter.  How can anyone claim they've learned anything in life when nothing they learn from it seems to sink in? ---  --- Sadly, this book left me with a very bad taste in my mouth.  I have no desire to read any more of his books	neg

The movie is interesting on many fronts:  Seeing the leads before they became megastars, watching the subtle condemnation of expats amongst locals, and the history woven into the fiction.  Supporting roles are played superbly as well.  It's a great movie	pos
Great product. I just received my ball today. I couldn't wait to work out. If I learn how to stay on it that would be saying something! I will always recommend Max-Fitness	pos
Right, so by putting a review down for this album, I am getting labeled as an emo kid who wears his sweater too tight, cuts himself and cries over his girlfriend all day long, well too bad that's not me, I am just a normal person who can tell the diference between bad and good music. Hawthorne Heights is an emo band who are criticised by lots and loved by lots of others, I have to agree that their lyrics are quite simplistic and are used over and over, they might even sound gay at some points, although, "we are so last year" made me laugh "I should have known you better, i should blame it on the weather" wtf is that??? Anywyas so the lyrics are probably the reason why I'm giving this 4 and not 5. But here we're talking music not lyrics. The music has nothing very special to it and I can play every song on guitar, they often use the same chords except for a few songs "This Is Who We Are", but they have a lot of interesting melodies and don't just rely on power chords to make their music interesting. Even though these chord sequences are often re-used, Hawthorne Heights always manage to make their sound diverse and interesting and they are slowly imposing themsleves as the kings of knock-out choruses. The other thing I have noticed in this album is that there are much less screaming parts which is an improvement and the guitarist has finally learnt where his place is in the band (behind his guitar) but also when is a good time to scream and when it isn't. This makes them quite different from most other emo bands who literaly destroy their sound with high shrieks. Hawthorne have become a little darker and even tune down their guitars in some of their songs now adding a bit more heavyness. Also check out "Where can I stab myslef in the ears" to see how hawthorne have improved. Overall this is a step forward from their last album, it won't change the emo scene forever, but it will leave its mark in your memories and will give you a good moment when listening to it	pos
I bought these lollipops for my allergic kids, because these are the only lollipops I have found that don't contain corn.  Not only do my kids love them, but so do my coworkers!  They are delicious - much more flavorful than your usual boring lollipops.  Watermelon is the office favorite so far..	pos
After leaving (or being dismissed from) Pink Floyd in 1968 due to his LSD use & erratic behaviour, singer/songwriter/guitarist Syd Barrett re-emerged in 1970 with his debut solo album, "The Madcap Laughs." The album did not come easy, as Syd never fully recovered from his drug use, and it clearly shows in his ragged performances on "Madcap Laughs." Producer Malcolm Jones did what he could with Syd for about half of the album, before handing the production reigns over to Barrett's former Floyd mates Roger Waters & David Gilmour to finish the job. Throughout the album, bum notes are played, beats are missed, and Barrett sings off-key. And on the rocker songs, the session players (from the group The Soft Machine) sound like they are struggling to keep up with Syd, who could hit a rough patch at any moment. For any other artist, this would all be nothing short of disastrous. And YET....in the case of Syd Barrett, any and all mistakes are immediately forgiven. Why? Because Barrett's songs on "The Madcap Laughs" are all wonderfully written, and although Syd's voice and guitar-playing are obviously not in tip-top condition, you can plainly hear on this album that he's trying. He's really, really *trying* to do his best, and his efforts really do shine through. For every bum note there's a passage that Syd plays beautifully, for every missed beat there are many beats that are hit right on schedule, and for every note that Syd sings off-key, there are many moments where his very distinctive, British voice is magical. And of course, there's Syd's lyrics. You may not know what all of them actually *mean*, really, but to my ears, they're still poetry. The rockers are still powerful ("No Good Trying," "No Man's Land," the rockabilly fun of "Here I Go," and the classic "Octopus"), and the softer numbers still have great beauty to them ("Terrapin," the passionate "Dark Globe," the effective "Golden Hair"---based on a James Joyce poem---and "Long Gone"). Even the more ragged numbers like "Feel" and "If It's In You," somehow still hang together quite well (amusingly, we even hear some brief banter from Syd in the middle of "If It's In You," as his voice goes wildly off the map, he stops playing, prepares for another take, and finally gets through the song). When all is said and done, "The Madcap Laughs," warts and all, is an excellent album. It is a flawed masterpiece, and it shows that Syd Barrett, even with his mind irreversibly fractured by this point, was still a genius musician.   	pos
I have a 2 year old and have seen him on all the Kids Channels.  I was hoping the DVD would show each of his songs as they are performed on TV.  Instead it was like a concert and did not keep my attention nor my sons.  This would have been a better CD instead of a DV	neg

I really tried to come to this movie with and open mind. I'm a huge fan of Jane Austen and I thought the 1995 BBC miniseries actually came close to doing justice to her novel. Still, I was looking foreward to seeing a new interpretation. Unfortunately this one seemed to miss the point of the story.  ---  --- Jane Austen had a hilarious way of satarizing the social conventions and mores while being in their midst. This film ignores the social conventions altogether and therefore misses a great deal of Austen's humor. For example an unmarried man and woman would NEVER greet each other in their pajamas. A man would never visit his fiancee while she was lying sick in bed in her nightgown. When these rules of propriety are ignored by the film, how are we supposed to understand or believe that it's a big deal when Lydia runs away with Wickham!? Another example is Lady Catherine. This is a woman who lives and dies by her snobbery and rigorous adherance to social conventions. Yet in this film we see her barge into the Bennet household in the middle of the night and wake Lizzie up to ask a question that could easily waited until morning (when Lady Catherine wouldn't have had to get her carriage driver out of bed to drive several miles in the dark- no streetlights remember- to the Bennet household) Because no one adhere's to societies rigorous, and for the most part arbitrary, rules, the movie misses the opportunies to subtly wink at the audience as it laughs at such things. ---  --- Another weakness lies in the casting. Granted these actors had big shoes to fill. Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle seemed to embody their characters in the 1995 miniseries, but as I said, there are other ways to interpret and play the characters. Unforunately here everyone seems as if they're reading lines with dramatic inflection- not acting. You can almost imagine Keira Knightly's script having notes saying "insert spunkiness here".   ---  --- While the scenery is lovely, the windswept cliff and farm images seem to recollect the tortured landscape of a Bronte adaptation more than a manacured Austen setting.  ---  --- Overall this film comes off as one big missed opportunity	neg
Great purchase -- good price, easy.  what more could you want	pos
The music contained Trout Mask Replica is some of the most unique, acid-drenched art to ever be pressed. The songs on the album are mainly divided into folkish a capella tunes and the crazed jams the Captain and his band are known for. Several strange, unconventional themes are visited and revisted throughout the track list, such as bulbs, gingham, trout, and a variety of other surreal, sensously described wildlife. However, if there's any reason to buy Captain Beefheart's Trout Mask Replica, it's to listen to the album as a whole. I find it difficult to listen to any other way. While I find this to be true, I do have favorites that I go to when introducing friends to the Captain, or simply jamming out to without dedicating myself to the full experience: "Ella Guru", "Dachaus Blues", "Dust Blows Forward", "Neone Meat Dream", and "Old Fart at Play" stick out	pos
A nice idea that doesn't provide adequate audio quality in my experience. The unit would pick up "noise" from the operation of my CD player, resulting in a background squealing that was especially audible between tracks. In addition, on trips I had to frequently flip through the various frequency settings to avoid conflicts with radio stations	neg
I TOTALLY disagree with the reviewers that say it smells strong and like a granny! I don't know what they're smelling, but obviously it's not this. It does smell a little stronger at first than it does when the fragrance has settled in, but it certainly doesn't smell like any granny I've ever smelled. I always get compliments when I wear this fragrance (which is every day)- complete strangers will come up to me and tell me how good I smell. I recommend starting with the body emulsion and then lightly spritzing the fragrance (1 spray should do the trick).	pos
I would not recommend this product for anyone over 3 & 1/2 years (unless small for their age).  My 4 yr old son (36lbs) got it for his birthday, and broke the steering wheel within 10 minutes.  There is plenty of room for him on the seat and inside the car, but its been "parked" since broken.  I wish we would have spent the money on something that would have lasted.  The plastic seems cheaply made.  The voice buttons and noises are loud and work well.  Stickers have already started to flake/peel off after 1 month.  Consider a bigwheel	neg
While I love Billie, in her own words, these sessions were dull, and uninspired. Since the reviews should focus on one CD, that is the jist of it; boring renditions, and back up musicians that are not the ones that  Billie was used to making for a very uneven collection	neg
I'll start out by saying that I prefer the Jason movies.  I think the whole body count is a fun way to watch a horror movie.  The Freddy movies are good horror movies, but they're not really slashers like I thought they would be. ---  ---  - A Nightmare on Elm Street -  ---  --- A great, classic horror movie by Wes Craven.  He creates good high school characters, although trying to prove that they're only 15 years old is a little far-fetched.  Freddy is more horrific and scary, he doesn't say much. ---  --- - A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge -  ---  --- They were asking for it when they completely changed the style and rules of Freddy in this sequel.  Many will disagree, but I don't think it's a bad movie, it's just very dark and horrific. ---  --- - A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors -  ---  --- Definately a step up from Part 2.  It goes back to the roots of the original film and brings back Nancy, who is now studying dreams and sleep in a mental hospital.  The style brings us back to the original movie with the same rules and objectives. ---  --- - A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master -  ---  --- Decent entry in the series carrying over characters from #3 and introducing all new characters.  The story doesn't flow as easily this time around and it's a step down from Part 3, but still good. ---  --- - A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child - ---  --- Stephen Hopkins' visual style makes this the best sequel in the series.  Freddy is hilarious and the special effects are great.  The story is more interesting than Part 4 and the characters have matured since that movie which is good. ---  --- - Freddy's Dead - The Final Nightmare -  ---  --- Cheesy storyline trying to tell us that in 10 years there will be no kids left in an American town?  Rachel Talalay thinks the 3-D effects in the film are lame, but not that story element?  If it weren't for the interesting backstory on Freddy, this wouldn't be a good movie. ---  --- - Wes Craven's New Nightare -  ---  --- Wes Craven did succeed in making an interesting and well made horror movie here, but it is a little strange to include it in the rest of the series.  Better watched on its own and not consecutively with the other movies. ---  --- - Nightmare Encyclopedia -  ---  --- Alot of interviews that aren't edited very interestingly make for a decent special features disk.  It's good to see that these interview aren't self serving at all and they're completely retrospective, it would've been nice to hear more from Heather Langenkamp, or possibly Johnny Depp? ---  --- This is a great set for extreme fans and a good set for casual fans.  I'm a huge fan of the Alien series and a pretty big fan of the Predator series, but not as much as Alien.  I would say that I'm now a huge fan of Jason and a good sized fan of Freddy in comparison to Alien/Predator.  I do recommend these movies, but this enormous box with annoying cardboard cases is outdated for today	pos
My 7 yr. old son is allergic to mosquito bites, plus I'm concerned about West Nile virus.  Unfortunately, mosquitoes love him, and he always get some really nasty bites when he is sleeping.  I bought this little unit, and now have peace of mind!  I turn this on in his room for about half an hour at bedtime, leaving his door open, then turn it off and close his door.  Any mosquitoes lurking in his room have been driven out by the geranium scent.  I do the same in my own bedroom, and I am very pleased with the results. ---  --- The geranium scent is rather strong, but not unpleasant.  I don't find it necessary to leave this on all night, so it's not a problem.  I also like that you can clip this on your belt and turn it on for when you are outside.  It's just a tiny little fan blowing through the geranium scented cartridge, so it is small and light-weight	pos

The gameplay and overall feel of this game screams Castlevania. The sidescrolling platform action is spot on, the graphics truly push the limits of the DS, and the variety of equipment/soul combinations will lend itself perfectly to creating a gameplay experience perfect for your style of play. ---  --- As people have said in past reviews, the use of the touch screen feels tacked on. To defeat bosses you have to draw symbols on the screen, which can be frustrating if a) you have poor penmenship, or b) are left-handed (such as yours truly) and have to scramble to take the stylus out, switch it to your other hand, and draw the symbol. It's a neat little addition but, again, it didn't really need to be there. ---  --- Also, the boss battles are sometimes a little too easy, even in the later levels. Don't get me wrong, there are some that are just downright nasty, but some of the bosses fire off their special weapon and all you can do is look at the screen and go "... that's it?" ---  --- Overall, this is another great game for the Nintendo DS. With the exception of the clunky touch screen addon, the game is overall fantastic	pos
This was a top-notch game.  I really enjoyed playing it.  It was a well-designed, thoroughly enjoyable shooter.  The good looking girl calling you "cowboy" all the time was a bit silly (especially since my wife was also playing the game at the same time I was). ---  --- If you've already played Halo and you're looking for a different but enjoyable shooter then try this one	pos
I read some reviews that there were some compatability issues with this sensor and the main unit. However, I had no trouble at all getting this sensor to work with my existing unit and sensor, once I realized I need to reset the main unit in order for it to recognize the newest sensor.

Though the description of this product says it's filled with natural buckwheat hulls and rice, mine had a strong smelling deodorant coming from the removable bags you heat.

Perhaps over time, or by next winter, the odor will be gone and I'll get some use out of them	neg
I wanted a simple printer so I could print a few prints from time to time to hand out. On sale for $50, this seemed like the right one.  ---  --- I already had the included Zoombrowser and Photo Stitch software installed from my prior purchase of a Canon A95 camera, so I just needed to install the driver. Note this requires a USB cable (not included) to the printer. ---  --- As is human nature, I tried to print without reading the Zoombrowser instructions, and got a lovely plain sky-blue print with the words "My Album" on it - but no photo :-) Then, out came a stunning second print which was totally blank but with some faint horizontal lines - this was from a residual click from my first attempt. Ok, Ok, so I looked at the PDF printing guide for about 15 seconds, and followed the instructions. ---  --- Got a beautiful first print of the Queen Mary ship. Got a gorgeous second print of flags (red/white/blue, and green) againt a clear blue sky, and the third print was very nice of a field of flowers near Mt Lassen (ironically the original proof print of this from 20 years ago was scanned onto my computer just today to get rid of paper prints...) ---  --- So, I've blown through the provided "trial" 5 sheets of paper and film cartridge, and have 3 very nice prints (with postcard address lines, stamp area and Canon logo on the back - the paper comes that way.) The ends of the paper remain white but have perforations about 1/2 inch from the end so you can remove them after printing. ---  --- I can't compare the printing software to any other brand, but setting up a plain photo-only print takes about 10 seconds of menu choices. If you want to add backgounds, titles/text, etc, that is available as well. (Got another pack of paper/film, and put humorous captions on kind of funny-bad office Christmas pix...) ---  --- Printing directly from my A95 takes about the same time as from the computer - about 1 min 45 sec. ---  --- The actual operation involves the paper being passed in and out of the printer 4 times (3 color passes and a protective layer) so it is important the back of the printer is not obstructed, particularly by the power cord which hangs down near the edge of the slot. The finished print is deposited on top of the paper cassette in front.   ---  --- The unit looks and feels substantial for its small size, comes well packed (survived NY to CA shipping), has decent documentation, and a 1-year warranty.	pos
i just got my new camcorder and start to operate it. first of all is's very easy to operate with the joystick, the use in the still image function is allways available, even while shooting a video (nice feature but as all camcorders - low quality pitures) the stabalizer (one of the reason why i'd preffered that cam over the other) is great and even in full zoom you can get pretty steady videos. the large zoom (X32) is also very nice. overall i think this is great value for my money....	pos
I bought this product thinking that it was so pricey it just had to work. Well it doesn't. I followed the directions and went through two bottles with no results what so ever.

If it doesn't work it should get 1 star because it is not delivering on its promise and the promise is why people buy this stuff. I wish I hadn't listened to the raves on this product	neg
It's only redeemingly quality is the price (if you get a good deal). Photo quality is poor, and screen is quite small (3x5). Navigation is not overly complicated, but buttons must be pushed hard to work.

But, because of the poor quality of the photos, I don't suggest buying	neg

 ---  --- THE FIRST HALF ---   If they had made movies back then, in 1871, it would move as slowly as this. ---   Perhaps that date suits the film to perfection. --- The days of utter simplicity, with nearly nothing happening.  --- Where maybe days are filled with yourself. --- Not distractions. ---  ---   After half an hour, all I could think was, if this was on TV, not only would everybody switch off, the sh** (show) would be axed. ---   It may even beat so many foregin movies as THE SLOWEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME.  --- But slow really means empty. ---  --- THE OTHER HALF (OF ME) ---   Yet I have since come to learn, by others' reviews, this is a movie which YOU must make, by the mood, or the feeling of dread others speak of. Or else you are left with the feeling of dead. ---   I failed to do that, and without that, the film fails miserably I reckon. Perhaps because I am dead.  ---   So, therefore, I envy those creative creatures of subtle senses. Or whether it was because they were so simple, or easily pleased, which means more modest, more modern.  ---   So, as in real life, it's only the FEELING which makes anything real. ---  --- MY FIRST (OR WORST?) HALF ---   The other part of me thought that, the film being a feature length, they think they can just not try for half an hour, an hour. Such is the problem with many filmakers, even today. When, being a torture, err feature, they should try much harder!! ---    Therefore the atmosphere spoken of in these reviews can only be like saying there is smoke without fire. Virtually nothing happens, and what does makes little sense, as any unconcious creation. ---  --- MY BETTER HALF OF THE SCHIZOPHRENIC ---   But the acting of the lead lady is expressive and genuine, and not being stereotype; is pleasingly real. Weird as suits the role. As are the others natural, with no Hollywood posing. How often have I heard that story - good acting, bad film? Oh I'm sorry, I did it again. ---   The only thing exciting is the title. ---  --- THE WHOLE ---    My conclusion is: I DON'T KNOW WHICH IS MY BETTER HALF, AND WHICH IS MY WORST HALF . . . ? ---   So, all things being unequal, I choose both. I stand and fall by both my views. (I guess that's why God gave us 2 eyes.) ---  ---    I was going to give it only one star* at first, but now I give it merely two**, knowing I'm still mean. ---  I see this movie as perhaps the greatest measure of one's temperament. ---   If you feel better than me, are supernaturally sensitive, or have the patience of a saint to me, add one, two, or three more stars respectively. ---  ---   I intend to watch it again, and then maybe I can give a before and after shot. ---  ---   Please feel free to reject me, write negative comments about me, or scare me. Or kill me. ---  --- [The world's First Amazoning Interactive Review] That makes it fair	neg

I would like to add to the reviews already posted, especially for anyone considering this lens as an alternative to the 80-400 VR.  This is one of the only times I can remember when I have had the money to buy a Nikon lens, but have not been able to bring myself to do it.  The 80-400 is 6 years old, uses ancient mechanical (slow) focus, and has yet to be updated with VRII technology.  All that, and it still costs more than the pro-quality Canon 100-400 IS, which has Canon's AF-S equivalent too!  That said, I like long yet portable lenses, and after giving myself fits decided to "settle" for the 70-300 because it has VRII and AF-S.  If you are in the same boat then buy this lens, it is a gem for its intended purpose.  I get sharp results wide open at 300, and the light weight more than offsets the slower apertures.  I would have LOVED this lens if it was an f/3.5, but even at 4.5-5.6 I have really been surprised at the results.  Save the $1000+ until Nikon updates the 80-400 dinosaur	pos
Microsoft Office Pro 2003 edition is a good product. It installed easily over Office Pro 1997. I haven't had any problems with it (yet).

    I recently purchased this Motorola HS805 headset and find it more than adequate. For the price, it is worth every penny. The ability of using AAA batteries puts it above all other headsets in that respect. Nonreplacable rechargable batteries are a gimmick. Once they finally die, your headset is useless. Too expensive to send away to repair. So you throw your headset and charger away and buy a new one. That is good for a company but not for you. ---    Depending on your ear structure the fit can be either formfitting or loose. From reading the other reviews here one can infer this. For me it is formfitting. Also you may infer that the Bluetooth telephone or device it pairs to would make a difference in performance. Some reviewers here felt that this headset had low volume or allowed some static. For me and others, we experienced no such problem.  ---    Best bet is to check the return policy if you find that it doesn't meet your standards. But if it works for your device, you have a headset that goes 16 days of standby and 22 hours of talk time on 1 AAA Alkaline battery!. And you will never be bothered with a charger unless you use rechargable AAA batteries which is a pretty good idea. If it also fits your ear comfortably then you have a winner	pos

I subscribed to Hobby Farm and after reading two issues I cancelled it.  ---  --- I read an article in the March/April issue about show birds. Then, I got my May/June issue. Don Schrider, the Communication Director of ALBC, wrote in to correct the story. The article claimed "over 1000" birds at the show, the correction was 11,640 birds were present. The other correction was regarding earlobe color and egg shell color stating there are exceptions to the red earlobe/ brown eggs white earlobes/white eggs.   ---  --- In the Mar/Apr issue I read an article about Guinea hens. In the May/June issue I read another letter from a reader (Dana Manchester a member of the Guinea Fowl Breeders Assoc.) correcting the article in the previous issue. Apparently, Guineas aren't the "watch fowl" they are portrayed to be, but fall victim to predation often. Dana Manchester also corrected the mislabeled photos of Guineas.  ---   --- These may be small errors but how goods is a resource that isn't reliable? ---   --- If errors were the only issues, I may have given the mag 3 stars but the article on manure management in the May/June issue was lacking on many levels. The advise in a nutshell was buy a manure spreader that you can pull around your field, fill'er up and drive. One word of caution according to the article- only use well rotted manure in the garden, but there wasn't one word on how to rot manure.   ---  --- I liked the article about smaller breeds of cattle, "Bigger is Not Better" May/June but we'll have to wait for the next issue to see if any readers step forward with corrections.  ---  --- I am not waiting around.  ---  --- There are a lot books and magazines dedicated to small farms. I like Mother Nature News and I just subscribed to Countryside (my nephew recommended it he owns a small farm, as well). I also like John Seymour's book Self-Sufficient Life and How to Live It. He has an upbeat attitude with a can-do spirit.	neg

Now that I have this chair, I'm not going to replace it but I have two major complaints about it.  Our son is 20 months old and I still have to put a book wrapped in a dishtowel in the seat so he can comfortably reach the tray or our dining table.  Raising the height doesn't help because the arms of the chair come up so high and so far forward you can't scoot the chair in any closer to a table.  The chair also has a very large footprint--unless you have a very spacious dining area it's hard maneuvering around it.  If I could do it over again, I wouldn't buy this high chair	neg

I used Tend Skin for a few years and it was the best one that I could find but a few weeks ago I saw a nother product on Amazon called Solution 2 and ordered it instead.  I was a little worried because I was getting good results with the bumps with Tend Skin but it burned a lot and dried out my skin quite a bit.  Solution 2 is definitely a better product for me with my sensitive skin and it works just as good on the bumps	neg

Many thanks to the earlier reviewers who recommended the Amigo.  We bought both the guitar and case for our 5-year-old daughter to take to weekly lessons and we couldn't be happier.  The materials, workmanship and finish are remarkable for the price.  And more importantly, it plays like a real guitar.  The sound is sweet and round enough that I genuinely enjoy the sound of 5-year-old practicing (!), and after an initial breaking-in period it holds tuning well	pos
After years of e-filing fees being included with the purchase price, it would have been more forthcoming for TurboTax to put a large sticker on the front of their box alerting buyers to the price that they will pay for e-filing each return. ---  --- I lost the value of my entire state return - and then some - through e-filing fees: $44.95 (plus tax) for the program, $16.95 (plus tax) for each return e-filed (I filed two) and a little bonus fee to the company that handles the [credit card] transaction (that fee is never quoted in the program and I will have to wait for my credit card statement to find out what that is).  In addition, anyone who chooses to have the fees deducted from his/her refund has to pay an additional $30. ---  --- The product does what it says.  But, for the cost, and less-than-honest way in which the change occured (it almost seemed deceitful - hence the single star rating), I would have preferred to have given my money to my friendly neighborhood accountant. ---  --- People expect change, even if they don't like it.  But, suprises that cost customers money are never welcome and drive customers away.  Surely the marketing/advertising gurus can think of a way to alert the customer of a significant change such as this and even put a "positive" spin on it.  "Filing fees only $16.95 [per return] - less than the cost of a tax professional . . ." ---  --- No more TurboTax for me	neg

I purchased this rack a few months ago and it is very neat. Problem is that it does tend to move when you put the MTX bag on. The movement becomes more of a problem as the weight of the bag increases. Another problem was getting enough clearance between the rack and the tire if you are short like me and don't have the seat raised up really far. If you play around enough you can get it to work, but if you decide to put on the Topek rear fender (which I did)you may have to adjust your seat a little higher than might be comfortable. I just got accustomed to having the seat a little higher. Bottom line is that Topek has made a very neat system that just needs a few more refinements (and some better instructions) to make it perfect. 	neg

I have had this camera for about a year.  It has been nothing but a problem.  First, the kodak easyshare software has continuous problems.  I have spent HOURS trying to fix it.  Still has bugs in it no matter what I do.  ---  --- Secondly, the camera is very unreliable.  I have a wedding to go to this weekend and I do not trust it and am taking a disposable camera too.  How do I explain the problems I have had?  There are so many.  The camera misfunctions continuously.  Sometimes it does nothing at all.  Other times the zoom lense will not shut.  You turn the option selector on and even though it is on the option you select you get another option.  I sometimes can not even shut the camera off I gotta take the batteries out to do so...if I can even find batteries that work in the camera. ---  --- Honestly, I call tech supoport and told them the problems I have having and they tell me that only Kodak batteries work with the camera and told me to buy some.  SO I went to a nice camera shop and they do not sell kodak batteries.  The camera salesman told me that Kodak cameras are junk and the brand of battery should not matter.  I believe him.  So my camera which would not work...I asked the salesman to help me out.  It did not work with any lithium batteries.....reusable or rechargable. He popped in some alkaline batteries and amazingly it worked.  Well, everyone knows alkaline batteries have a real short short life.  My camera now does not work with either batteries.  Probably only Kodak batteries....maybe....or maybe Kodak wants to get another ten bucks out of me. ---  --- I personally don't even think the pictures this camera takes are any good.  Really, when people take pictures of me with this camera my eyes are always closed.  I am so anxious to get rid of this camera.....well would be but know I gotta fork over at least $250 on a good camera.  Trying to save money on this 'disposable' camera was a waste.  STAY AWAY FROM KODAK CAMERAS!  If you don't believe me get a creditable camera magazine and read reviews. --- 	neg

I've never been quite a fan of music DVDs.  By that I mean the live stuff.  I much rather be there to experience it then sit at home pretending I'm there.  That's one side of it.  I'm also a huuuuuge Gorillaz fan.  And I have seen them live.  The show to their self titled debut. But don't get me wrong, that doesn't make me biased towards everything they put out.  On the contrary it leaves me to judge them on a higher level because I only expect the best from what they've given. ---  --- With that said, this has to be literally one of the best music DVDs I have encountered in quite some time.  Don't worry about extras, documentaries, which while would have been nice to show how it was put together, are not here.  Which makes sense since the band itself is very discreet they wouldn't show you all that. ---  --- The show itself was amazing, and it literally jumps off screen as you watch this, and I recommend you have a decent audio system as well.  The amazing sound quality coupled by the beautiful visuals is astonishingly done well.  The editing and the post production were so well conceived they worked on this like a labour of love and not just another DVD to sell.  From start to end it will leave you speechless.  As you stare in awe at the grandioso that is the Gorillaz, you realise that while at first you figured them to be a fictious band in every aspect, they are quite real and very capable of producing grand music on every level.  You can tell by this by the standing ovation and after the show and after the encore.  Only few bands have ever been able to touch me musically on such a deep level. And to put on such a show which normally you could only catch at the studio over a period of months to produce is a feat in itself. ---  --- If you want special features videos and documentaries get the 2 other DVDs especially now since they just released their newest one.  Those will fill in all that nicely.  But even if you're not a fan or just a new convert, I highly recommend you own this.  No matter the age, or person you are, (you notice this on the DVD as well) and regardless of what your favourite genre is.  Because they are so massive they can't be contained into one. ---  --- Thank you Damon and Jamie for such an experience, mates	pos

I have been studing leadership for over 15 years both by reading and experience.  I consider this book to be the best book I have read because it describes leadership as a learned activity.  It also says that leadership is in motivating people to do their own work in solving difficult problems. I found that as President of my congregation I was continually going back to the concepts in the book to lead it through a very difficult situation involving placement of the flags in the sanctuary.  It was very difficult to get people to do their own work and not try to step in to solve everything. (That would have been impossible anyway) I found that he described President Lyndon Johnson as a successful leader (civil rights) and unsuccessful leader ( Vietnam).  His discussion on leading without authority is new ground for me.    If you want to discuss the book with others there is an on-line book study at the Work and Worship Institute website. I found it was a good way for me to get more from the book. This is a great book with great stories of a variety of leaders in our society. 	pos

I ordered a Motorola RAZR V3 Mauve Phone (Unlocked)a month ago. I was hoping to get the color that I saw on the web page...and that's where the problem lies.  ---  --- The image shown is completely misleading.The phone that I received, was mauve but a different one from the picture shown on the Amazon web site. --- The mauve phone that I got was a grayish dull mauve and not the pretty pinkish mauve as advertised. Also,the phone had 2 different color tones. At night/in the lighting at night, the top part of the phone(the part that flips open) and its corresponding part at the back of the phone looks completely gray. ---  --- Needless to say, I spoke to customer service and sent the phone back for an exchange.I didn't have to pay the shipping charges.  ---  --- The 2nd phone that came had the same color problem again, so for the 2nd time I returned it and got my money refunded. ---  --- I gave 1 star due to the customer service provided, but again they could not help me. Some one said it could be an item with a defect....but for me --- the whole experience was  disappointing. ---  --- If you are ready to spend so much on this phone its because of the brand, and the 'color' which you will never get because Amazon has put the wrong image on the web page...very misleading and wrong to all the customers. ---  --- Incidentally, this color as seen is offered by Verizon and they call it 'pink', but Amazon calls it 'mauve',though the phone and the image shown do not match.  --- So stay away from ordering this pretty mauve phone...all you will get is loads of disappointment with your time being wasted. ---  --- 	neg

Star Wars: Jedi Knight II - Jedi Outcast. The third game in the Star Wars Dark Forces series.  ---  --- INTRODUCTION:  --- I've pretty much always been a fan of Star Wars, and as you may have guessed, I'm a fan of many of the games based on the series. Although Star Wars games are often hit and miss, when one succeeds, it usually succeeds beautifully. One of the most interesting ideas for a Star Wars game was Dark Forces, released for the Playstation One and the PC. Although the game itself was horrendous, with a terribly-choppy framerate and very poor level design, it was something the world had never seen before - a Star Wars first-person shooter. The sequel, Jedi Knight, cleaned up a lot of the problems, and added in some new innovations. And now the third game in the series, Jedi Outcast, has arrived. Like previous games in this sub-series, it has gotten a multi-console release. Read on to see how it fares!  ---  --- OVERVIEW:  --- Jedi Outcast is a Star Wars first-person shooter. The game has a one-player quest, as well as several different multiplayer modes.  ---  --- REVIEW:  --- To put it simply, this game is everything the original Dark Forces should have been. While not perfect, this game is a huge improvement over its predecessors. Once again you play the role of Kyle Katarn, the agent from the other Dark Forces titles. The second Death Star has been destroyed, but many Imperial forces still fight on, so it's up to you to infiltrate their hideouts and exterminate them. The graphics are, for the most part, solid. I was impressed at how good they are for this kind of game. Nothing state-of-the-art, but they're still pretty damn good. Control has also been given an overhaul and rightfully so, since this game lets you use force powers and wield a lightsaber. The single-player mode is extremely entertaining, and the fact that the game offers multiplayer options only adds to the overall value of the package. And you can save whenever you want to in the single-player mode! But, of course, the game isn't perfect. Like earlier Dark Forces games, the level design just is not that good. Too many areas look alike, and there are too many instant death spots that are just too easy to fall into. Likewise, in many cases your objectives are unclear, and some of the puzzles are a pain - I don't know about you, but I buy first-person shooters to shoot people, not solve puzzles! Because of the imbalanced puzzles and often poor level design, it took me over an hour just to beat the first level! Another huge problem is availability. Lack of custom control configuration also plagues the game. This is a huge problem, since the game's limited control selections will often clash with what you're used to for this sort of game. This game wasn't released on the Gamecube in very high quanitites, so you're gonna have to shell out the full new price just to get a USED copy - and in my mind, it's NOT worth that price. Sad but true. I do recommend this game to Star Wars fans, just be warned that it's not perfect, and it's hard to get a copy.  ---  --- EDITION NOTES:  --- This is a good game, but for some strange reason it just wasn't available on the Gamecube for very long. Because of this, even USED copies fetch close to the original new retail price. This is extremely annoying for people like me who want to get every Star Wars game. Still, you should hunt it down if you're into this sort of thing.  ---  --- OVERALL:  --- Overall this is the best game in the Dark Forces sub-series thusfar. Where the game succeeds, it succeeds beautifully. I am impressed with the game, it's just a shame the Gamecube version was not made readily available to all would-be players. I strongly recommend this game if you can get a hold of it - I doubt it will disappoint any Star Wars fan. 	pos

Plugged the unit in a few weeks after I purchased it.  I was heading down to VA. for a reunuion (8 hr. trip).

Jmaes Joyce takes us on Stephen Daedalus' interior journey from pre-teen as son of a country gentleman to young adult who wanders the streets of Dublin, struggling with sin, salvation, intellect, ambivalence about his homeland, and his father's decline.

We bought one of these in the spring of '05. We took it on vacation in July of '05 and the LCD screen blacked out a few days into our vacation. I called HP and was informed that a RECONDITIONED (used) camera was all that I could get. The camera was still under the manufacturers' warranty, but their policy was to replace it with a used camera, not a new one. I had to settle for the "reconditioned" camera.  It has been OK since then.  ---  HP's customer service is at best mediocre. There are the usual annoying and seemingly endless voice prompts in order to get to an actual service rep, and since HP has out-sourced all of its tech support to the third world, I had a hard time understanding the reps I spoke to. ---  This camera also eats a ton of batteries and takes a few seconds to engage after depressing the button, which is annoying if you're trying to photograph anything other than a posed shot. ---  All in all, disappointing. I will never buy another HP camera	neg

I purchased six of these chairs in August for myself and my friends before the start of the college football season for tailgaiting.  They were all made by this manufacturer (North Pole) and had different NFL logos on them (I only bought one through Amazon, the others were bought through different companies due to availability issues). ---  --- At the first game of the season, my chair (Steelers) broke.  At the second game of the season, two more chairs (Bengals and Broncos) broke.  They were not misused and no weight limits were exceeded.  They all broke in the same exact place; the plastic pieces at the base of the legs all cracked.  Therefore, 3 out of 6 broke within probably less than 3-5 hours. ---  --- Needless to say, at $25-$30 each I would recommend prospective buyers to spend their money elsewhere	neg

It embarrases me that I, a music man, have let this many years go by without reviewing this splendid movie. My wife rented it from a Hasting's video store back when DVDs were not widely distributed. I was in awe of the movie as it ended because I had no clue what to expect, and I wasn't expecting much anyway. ---  --- Richard Dreyfuss plays the role of Glenn Holland, a recent college graduate who takes the job of a music teacher to provide an income (he calls it a 'fall back position') while he writes what he hopes will be a musical masterpiece that will make him rich and famous. His first semester is a trying and learning experience as students see him as that school teacher everybody hated and whose class everyone dreaded. ---  --- But he finds his way into the students' hearts. The movie begins in the early 1960s, and rock 'n' roll has etched a permanent mark on the music landscape. Most of the students, of course, love the new music. Realizing he has an 'in' with the students, he makes an accurate comparison by playing Bach's "Minuet in G" (for Anna Magdalena) and asking the students what song it is. They reply it is the "Lovers Concerto" by the Toys ("What color is the rain that falls softly on my window.."). He notes they are wrong and that it is actually the SAME song (although he doesn't note that Bach's is in 3/4 and the Toys in 4/4) and is an example of an ancient music scale called the Dorian scale. He now has them right where he wants them. ---  --- Along the way, he continues to work on his masterpiece. But life, a new baby who turns out to be deaf, and the need for new things put his life on hold. As he notes by quoting John Lennon, "Life is what happens while you're making other plans" (or some facsimile thereof). Years continue to go by and events occur that happen in the life of virtually ever music teacher. ---  --- He has that one student who has a lot of heart but not a lot of ability - yet needs to get an hour of credit so he can remain eligible to play football. He has another student who wants to play the clarinet but is nervous. Yet he always comes back to the simple rock 'n' roll to make his point about 'real' music. ---  --- But reality plays hide and seek sometimes. He has it out with his wife about their deaf son - and his frustrations come to a boiling point on the night John Lennon is killed. Over time, they become friends - and one of the sweet sights of the movie is the son feeling the vibrations from the speaker as he 'hears' the music. ---  --- But another reality awaits - education budget cuts, and here Dreyfuss delivers the line with outstanding effect: "The day they cut the football budget in this state...well, that will certainly be the end of western civilization as we know it." It is in the presence of his now good friend, Jay Thomas (the football coach), that he talks about how he never wanted to teach but now that is all he wants to do. ---  --- The music track in this movie is awesome. There's just one thing I'm still trying to figure out: how did the students manage to mass distribute his music and practice it without him knowing it? --- 	pos

Despite the chintzy, unconvincing facial hair (Jeff Daniels' being the exception); Martin Sheen's too-gentlemanly interpretation of Gen. Lee's accent (and his beard); obvious & saccharine soliloquies about the higher purpose for fighting the war; generalized (and largely inaccurate) interpretations of the underlying history of the war; and hopelessly, ridiculously, wildly off-the-mark attempts atNew England accents, the film still works. ---  --- I understand that to get a film produced and distributed, it is often necessary to have recognizable names in the cast.  But an unknown who looks more like General Lee than Martin Sheen would have been a better choice.  And C. Thomas Howell's performance--well, let's just say that his glued-on beard was more convincing than his acting.  Jeff Daniels, however, does an excellent job, in large part because he doesn't try to convince you he's from New England and consequently does not come off like Cliff from Cheers, using every stereotype associated with nasal 'r'-dropping.  Instead of focusing on the so-called nasality of  the NE accent (think of Sheen in The Missiles of Octobah), Daniels allows the viewer to suspend disbelief.  But then, here comes CT Howell again to slap you across the face and remind you that Sheen and Kevin Costner aren't the only actors who should have appeared as New Englanders in an Ed Wood production. ---  --- I think the story works because there's enough commitment to historical military fact to make it believable.  The battle scenes probably should have been more visually graphic to evoke the horror of the battle, but the movie makers either didn't have the budget for gore (maybe it was spent on the obviously fake beards) or decided to err on the side of forbearance.  If Gettysburg had been made 8-10 years later, it might have benefited from the newer style of violence-depiction, as in Saving Private Ryan, Thin Red Line, or Gladiator.  It falls a bit short of that, however. ---  --- Finally, it should be noted that the producers/director seem to be operating on a rather simplistic view of the war's historical underpinnings, opting to represent the northern point of view as one united behind the idea of freeing the slaves. Anyone who knows about the Boston busing riots of the 1970s will understand that not all of the north is steeped in racial generosity and brotherhood. Very few who fought on the side of the blue fought because they believed in the abolition of slavery.  They fought to preserve the Union, which is a very different concept.  Abolition of slavery happened to be the issue that forced the South's hand, but it was not the sole cause of the war.  The movie dumbs this down a bit, making the message more like what you'd find in a 5th-grade text book. ---  --- The battle at Gettysburg was certainly pivotal, but viewers should remember that it did not end the Civil War.  The north absolutely needed to win it, but Lee continued to cause the North fits for almost 2 years after Gettysburg.  C. Thomas Howell will continue to cause me fits every time I think of this movie. ---  --- Still and all, the film is very watchable.  And due credit should be given to the re-enactors, arguably the greatest source of credibility for the film	pos
...and three years later I buy the game. --- Wow! Awesome! I can't believe it runs so well after the three years of its release! Everything looks and feels great on my XP. This is one of the only games I have purchased and and not had to return due to the CD being messed up or some corrupted file. So... I'm happy! ---  --- I thought no one would play the multi player anymore but there seem to always be games going on. Yep, this is a game I would suggest to any gamer	pos
I cringe at the idea that I fed my baby from heated up polycarbonate bottles. I might not be able to breastfeed my baby, but with my new glass bottles, at least I know that I am feeding her the purest form of formula I can possibly give. She hated the taste of the latex rubber nipples so I bought some silicone ones and was successful. --- When I consider the epidemic of autism in this country, I am dedicated to buying pure, organic baby products and avoiding using plastic products especially when heating in the microwave. 	pos
When I received the item the box was busted open and all the cookies in both packages were crushed up.  One of the packages was open and leaking cookies dust all over my car when I pulled it out of the mailing box.  On top of that the one or two cookies that were salvaged were stale!  Ill never order anything from this company again!!!  My entire $11.00 went down the tubes.  What a waste!!!	neg
I just received my first order, and I love it!  This magazine covers a broad range of topics and includes designer techniques, current trends, period styles and so much more.  It has tons of vibrant pictures to illustrate the articles.  I think this magazine would be ideal for someone just starting out in design to gain a basic understanding on a wide range of topics, and also for the experienced designer to keep up with current trends and fill in the gaps with knowledgeable tidbits	pos
I watched this movie last evening and I have to say that I have never seen weird, confusing movie since 12 Monkies.  I'm still confused.  --- The plot is pathetic and mindlessly confusing, it's all about lucid dreams and Tom Cruise seeing how many times he can flick his hair in a minute while the cameras on him.  The film is basically all a blur from start to finish, it's a dreadful mix of sci-fi nonsense and obvious fake romance.  Why on earth would someone want to remake a foreign film with this kind of plot anyway.  Don't buy this film on DVD or you'll be wasting your money.  I'm sorry if you've found this review uninformative, but since Vanilla Sky is really about nothing whatsoever it's very hard to go into much detail.	neg
I've used GS27 on two cars of mine that had scratches. I've noticed it will permanently remove or greatly improve nearly all minor to medium scratches. It really depends on the scratch and how deep it is. It works like MAGIC on some scratches and dramatically improves most other mild to medium grade scratches. It works alot like a car wax as far as application/removal. You have to buff it off with a cloth and it will have a brilliant shine. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is it doesn't completly remove all scratches.	pos
This has been my everyday scent for the last six years. The predominent note is a sparkling anise, an anise that affects a cold, even metallic, chemic artifice. Swirling about this shivery base note are hints of moss, violet, and vanilla-like tonka, lending an aura of both forest and fantasy.  ---  --- Though this is a relatively popular scent, Lolita eschews convention. There are no white flowers, no rose, no peach, none of the banal and cloying sweetness that plagues so many scents. This perfume is instead sensual yet apart, not at all come-hither but insinuating and dark as a Grimm's tale. The tonka is sweet and powdery, gently seductive, while the more prominent anise intoxicates. ---  --- The bottle is stunning; I never throw out a spent one.  --- 	pos

I lived through the vietnam era.  IF you did you can't ever forget.  This guy was right in the middle of the crucial decisions that brought the debacle down on us.  Here he sifts through the sands of his memory and tries to synthesize how it went wrong, why it went wrong and what we can learn to KEEP FROM REPEATING IT.   ---  --- For me, here was the most unforgettable moment.  Decades later he returns to vietnam and winds up sitting at a formal dinner next to his north vietnamese counterpart from those days.  Macnamara tells him we--the americans--were not a colonial power seeking to impose our will but were fighting to stop the spread of communism, seeing north vietnam as a tentacle of communist china.  The north vietnamese official gaped at him and then began pounding the table and said, "Mr. Macnamara, you must have never read a history book!  We've been FIGHTING the chinese for a thousand years!  We aren't their puppet!  We were fighting for our national freedom!  We would have fought to the last man!"  Macnamara says they almost came to blows. ---  --- Here's the point.  Macnamara says, as compared to say the soviets, we didn't understand the north vietnamese.  We didn't really know enought about them.  We had no idea what was in their minds.  And that was why we wound up fighting the wrong war against the wrong country and for the wrong reasons!  That's why we lost! ---  --- Does any of this sound familiar??????   ---  --- This is a fantastically good piece of work that ought to be required viewing for every american of voting age.  It's that good and that informative.  Of course, it won't be widely viewed by the american public.  We'll go our goofy way coveting our big-screen tvs and gas guzzling cars and spending our time on important things--like sporting events	pos

This movie creeped me out and not in a good way. Johnny Depp is an awesome actor and I usually find him sexy but in THIS stinker I find him really creepy and gross. Maybe it's the Michael Jackson-ish look he has going on with the black wig and white face. Could they have picked a more horrible look for WW? It looked like they took him to a costume store and put a 10$ wig and 5$ clown makup on him! I love Tim Burton's other movies but this one sucked BIGTIME! It gives a new perspective on Willy Wonka but this Willy is someone I would keep kids AWAY from. This movie is childish if you're an adult and pales compared to the original. If you're a kid it's way too dark and scary and has some adult humor which will leave kids asking "Auntie Zoe, what does that mean?" When are screenwriters going to figure it out? EITHER WRITE A KIDS MOVIE OR WRITE A GROWNUP MOVIE!!! It's really hard to do both in the same film. It seems like when writers try to make movies that appeal to adults and kids, they end up appealing to nobody! Maybe I am biased because I loved the original Gene Wilder version. I would have been open to seeing a remake if it was GOOD but this movie was dissapointing. It's amazing how so much money and effort go into special effects and expensive sets and the script itself is hollow with lousy characters. The whole thing just had a creepy vibe with almost sadistic undertones. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I love Depp and Burton, if you are not a fan of either, don't waste your time with this steaming pile of poo!	neg

Valkyrie Profile is a cult classic.  No matter how you look at it.  It was one of those games you either loved or hated.  Obviously enough people loved it enough for Square-Enix to re-release the original on the PSP and make a second one on the Playstation 2.  The end result is a great game that should satisfy fans of the original.  ---  --- Despite what it looks like, Valkyrie Profile 2: Silmeria is not a sequel to Valkyrie Profile but a prequel.  This means if you've never played the first one, fear not, you aren't missing anything.   ---  --- The story centers on Silmeria.  She's a Valkyrie trapped in the body of Princess Alicia.  Because of this it seems like Alicia has a split personality, and that she's got to be crazy or something.  As a result, Alice doesn't have very many friends... if any at all.  Silmeria, has been exiled by Odin, the leader of the Gods.  She now wants revenge for what he has done to her, and since Alice has no friends, she agrees to help.  It's an interesting story, but much like the first one, gets off to a really slow start and takes a while to pick up.   ---  --- The game's story is told through beautiful cinematics  Not quite the best looking game on the PS2, but beautiful enough.  The backgrounds, characters and monsters are all detailed.  Especially in some of the games cutscenes.  The voice acting is also suitable enough for the game.  The game also sounds really good.   ---  --- The good news about Valkyrie Profile 2 is that there is no time limit.  Fans of the first will remember that there was a time limit before the battle at the end of the game.  Valkyrie Profile 2 does away with that and thank goodness it does.  This gives you far more time to explore and do everything the game has to offer, and the dungeons are quite interesting.  ---  --- Most Dungeons are pretty simple.  It sort of plays out in an action/adventure style.  You have photons you can fire at your enemies and certain objects.  Your photon also reflects off some objects, and it's actually vital to use this in some dungeons.  So the photon isn't just there, it's essential.  Even more interesting in Valkyrie Profile is the battle system.  ---  --- Battles are contact based.  In battle you've got your characters on one side and your enemies on the other.  At first it seems like battles take place in real time, but in reality, the enemy only moves when you move.  This gives you more than enough time to plan out a strategy.  Each enemy has an attack zone.  If you're in it, you'll be attacked.  In most RPGs getting attacked is no big deal.  In Valkyrie Profile 2 it's much more than just a big deal.  The difficulty of this game escalates really fast. You'll quickly find yourself overwhelmed by some of your enemies.  Luckily there is a solution.  Most battles have a leader.  If you defeat the leader you win automatically without having to worry about defeating the others.  It helps if you want to end the battle quickly, and especially helps when your party is being decimated.  Still, the battle system calls for complete strategy on your part.   ---  --- They say it takes about 40 hours to complete Valkyrie Profile 2.  However, you'll find yourself spending most of these hours leveling up to take on new challenges.  As I mentioned, the difficulty level rises fast.  Meaning you'll probably do a lot of battling in a dungeon before moving on to the next.  Even worse, you'll have to backtrack out of a dungeon once you complete it.  Even worse than that, enemies respawn when you reenter a room.  The good thing about this at least, is that the dungeons aren't overly long.  Again, however, you'll spend quite some time leveling up.  ---  --- In addition to inside battle, outside battle is just as interesting in dungeons.  You'll often come across sealstones.  When you pick them up they grant enhancements to your party.  They can be either positive or negative.  For example your strength could go up by grabbing one... and go down by grabbing another.  Carrying it puts the effect on your party.  However, you can also put the effect on your enemies by setting the stone on a dais.  Needless to say, you'll want to put the negative effects on your enemies... unless you're looking for a harder challenge than the game already is.  ---  --- Outside of dungeons and battles you can learn plenty of skills throughout the game.  When you buy equipment, you can link it together to give your characters special skills.  This is a lot of fun to play around with.  Although, it should be said, it gets tedious to set it up after a while.  The game shows you which skills you've created through your equipment, but there's no way for it to auto-equip with the stuff that gives you that skill.  At first this is no problem, but then as your characters start to build up and your list gets longer, it becomes a pain to set up all these skills again.  It comes down to way too much time in the menu when there shouldn't have to be.  ---  --- Valkyrie Profile 2 is overall a pretty satisfying game.  If you can get past the sluggish story (which really does turn out to be really good in the end) then you'll find yourself in love with this game.  It's different from the first one, but not so much that old fans will find themselves disappointed.  Actually it's quite the opposite.  If you liked the first game, then by all means, pick up this one.  ---  --- The Good ---  --- +An interesting story --- +Beautiful graphics --- +Excellent music score --- +Good voice acting --- +Large cast of playable characters --- +Interesting skill system --- +Just all out fun to play ---  --- The Bad ---  --- -The story is slow --- -Really steep difficulty level, a lot of the game will no doubt come from you spending time leveling up in dungeons before moving on --- -The skill system is interesting, but not being able to have your equipment auto-equip is really annoying when you've got a lot of characters and a lot of items in your inventory--equipping your characters shouldn't be a tedious chor	pos
So here's the deal, I'm from Omaha, you can't go two miles without an Omaha Steaks Store.  Here we just call em steaks.  I can go to any butcher shop in Omaha and buy steaks that are just as good if not better than anything Omaha Steaks has to offer for considerably less.  This has always been my stance.  That is until I had these, these are quite simply the best steaks.  Yes, they're expensive, but if you're like my family and go out for steaks on birthday's you can actually save quite a bit by buying these instead.  You won't get a better steak in a restaurant, and my uncle's the head chef in a steak house, I could be stabbed just for saying that.  Cooked rare to medium rare you can literally cut them with your fork, they are more tender and have twice the flavor of any filet I've ever had.  I can't stress to you how good these are.  It's still the only steak I buy from Omaha Steaks, but when you come from the land of steaks that's saying a lot.  Sorry Texas, you may have more cows, but Nebraska Beef is simply better	pos

I ordered the Schwinn 203 just a week ago. It was eligible for free delivery and I took advantage of that offer. It stated that it would take extra time for delivery, however it arrived within a week. Though several have stated it was difficult to put together and took several hours my highly non-mechanical wife and I had it together in about an hour and fifteen minutes. The directions are a bit tricky but knowing that in advance from the other reviews helped. Once we were finished assembling it I got on it and started it up and began peddling. I was sure it was not working correctly becuase there was absolutely no sound at all--mechanical or otherwise. I then reached over and increased the resistance and found out it was working correctly. My wife and I both use it and love it. I am 325 pounds and it works great for me and based on several nights of extreme sweating during my workouts I don't expect to be 325 for long. Super bike!! Very pleased...besides this is what my knee surgeon suggested for rehabilitating a knee I torn up last year and it's doing fine	pos
This receiver puts out a lot of power. It also has a bit of weight to it. It comes with a microphone to automatically adjust it for optimal surround sound. The remote take some getting used to but it is great how you can hook up a DVD player, CD player, radio and many other devices. The display is nice. You really have to read the manual before you start plugging away. If you're a surround sound fan on a budget pick this up	pos
It does work very well once you decide on the best ceiling mount location.  I had to remount/move once to get the laser beam to hit the spot on the car dashboard that we wanted it to when the car was at its desired parking position.

The Cybershot DSCS40 was bought as a Christmas gift for my daughter in 2005.  A few days after Christmas 2006, the camera ceased functioning.

Needless to say, we will not be purchasing another Sony product in the future	neg

I usually hates granola bars.  They tend to be too sweet and I am not crazy about the texture.  My 3-year-old son's daycare requires all new kids to pack an earthquake emergency kit (yet, we live in California) and one of the required items is 10 granola bars.  I bought this just to prepare the kit, hoping that he would never have to eat them.  Since the product comes with 30 bars, I took some to the office as my emergency stash.  They are actually quite tasty.  My son also likes them as a quick afternoon snack while we are out and about.  Never thought we would actually consume them when I bought this but it looks like we will reorder soon.  And it's organic	pos
This game is simply awesome. I received it for a gift last Christmas and I still love it. The graphics & action are amazing, it's not available on XBOX.

Looking forward to God of War 2 	pos
I've owned this model for about seven years and I think I'll buy another to keep on standby in case I break the original (I'm not gentle with my watches while working/playing). ---  --- Tough, pretty easy to set, good features, and classic "diver" style at a great price. What's not to like? Wouldn't mind having a light on the LCD, otherwise it is proven a great investment. ---  --- Battery lasts ~2 years with the alarm going off every day and watch band life is about the same (cracks develop after a while). No corrosion (duh, stainless steel) and good resistance to scratches on the crystal so far.	pos

I have been a user of PaperPort since version 9, skipped the upgrade to 10 because of bad reviews, received an upgrade notice in the mail, so I decided to buy it. It turns out it was a bad decision. The scanner that I use with 11 is the same as with 9 and is on Nuance's hardware compatibility list. The problem is, it took me uninstalling and reinstalling the program to get the scanner to work at all with PaperPort. Then, when I did get it installed - and I used the advanced setup option with it, tested it, all looked good - except everytime I scan something, the program crashes! It is literally unusable as a scanning solution. ---  --- I have seen a few companies with products that were once really good, sell it off to another company, and the product support seems to be essentially abandoned. It seems that this may be the case. There are no updates or bug fixes for 11, and I will not buy another PaperPort version in the future. I will attempt to go back to 9, and probably stay with that. If I run into any issues with it over time, I will look elsewhere, and I recommend others do the same. I normally don't write reviews for products, but this one is so poor, I just had to warn people	neg
I came to this film after rave reviews from friends, so perhaps I was expecting too much. There is much to admire here; the acting is top-notch, the contrast between chatty characters and completely silent people in the opening interview scenes is well-crafted, and the plot premise itself is a fascinating one. For me, films are all about endings, and I felt in this area After Life didn't quite pay off. I didn't really buy into the romance, and wanted to know more backstory about the female character so I could care more whether she gets the guy or not.  I also thought they could have cut it a bit more - it feels 10-15 minutes too long to me. However, these are minor criticisms; it is a film I will watch again, and recommend to Japanese film fans, especially those who like the more slow-paced Japanese films such as Eureka, Moe no Suzaku and Sonatine	pos

I wanted this Bible for Mother's Day after I did not get it I ordered it on June 25 and got it rather quickly.  Enough said about the wonderful shipping time with Amazon Prime. ---  --- I normally do not like Bibles that do not have the words of Christ in red but this Bible is sensational.  I love it!!!! I like the way it gives an overview of each book of the Bible.  The colorful maps and illustrations make this Bible beautiful.  At the end of the Bible there are 365 memory verses to be learned each day.  So not only is studying emphasized but learning scriptures is also emphasized. ---  --- This Bible is wonderful for individuals who are new to reading the Bible.  I would highly recommend geting this Bible as a gift for a new convert or seasoned veteran in the Gospel who is interested in in depth study.  Reading this Bible is fun. 	pos

This is one program that in my opinion you get more than what you pay for I have several Immaging programs that I use for several different things.

However you do have to be some what computer savy, (like know where to turn on the computer kind of thing) not like some of the 1 star comments that were made here by other folks. I would recomend it to all people that need a simple to use program. Its not what you pay for something its what you do with it after you get it	pos
I really liked this product.  I am a late 30's woman whose skin is basically pretty good.  I have occasional mild breakouts and some blackheads, but even before I bought the Neutrogena microdermabrasion I would receive compliments on how smooth my skin is. But around age 35 I looked in the mirror and realized my skin was getting that middle-age dullness to it.  Unwilling to pay for a professional microdermabrasion, I decided to try the Neutrogena at home system.   ---  --- The Neutrogena Microdermabrasion cream is easy to apply.  The cream had the slightest pleasant smell, and was not sticky at all.  I used well less than a teaspoon, so a little goes a long way.  It was no problem to rinse it off my face with water, and the sponge was very easy to clean as well.  The treatment took me less than 10 minutes, fit in easily to my bedtime routine, and after the initial start-up treatments you only need to do it a couple times a week. ---  --- My skin definitely felt softer, smoother and more invigorated.  I could notice a difference after only one treatment.  But the real proof came from the way my husband did a double take a couple days later and commented that I looked younger.  (He didn't know about the microdermabrasion.)  And even my 6 year old daughter told me my face looked pretty.  There was a clear and noticeable difference--after only a few treatments my middle-aged dull skin had definitely gotten back some of its youthful glow, and the few large pores I have did appear smaller. ---  --- Being lazy, I have not incorporated it into my regular routine like I should, but I do pull it out a few days before special occasions, vacations, or anytime I feel the need for a little brightening up, and will definitely always keep it on hand. ---  --- If you have particularly sensitive skin, this may not be a great product for you, as it is a bit, well, abrasive.  For me, it was a painless process, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to give their skin a more youthful glow	pos

This works great with our Chicco Capri stroller. It took a bit of trial and error to get it in the perfect place so the stroller would close. However, once I figured that out, it was great. I could take the accessories off and just put them on when needed. The swivel is a great concept. I actually wish it came with a third clasp so baby could have a cup holder and snack holder (one on each side) and mommy could have her water bottle clip. We just switch them out for baby or they hold their sippy by the handles.	pos

This deal was too good to be true. Of course I wasn't expecting any name brand stuff here, but at least I expected them to all work.

The Sunday Philosophy Club, and the other 2 titles in this series by John McCall Smith, are everything the fans of Mme Ramotswe would hope they would be. Leaving Botswana was hard, but now we are in Edinborough Scotland, and Isabelle Dalhousie is as wise and vulnerable and real and wonderful as her African predecessor.  It is a miracle that a man can write his women characters so believably and so lovably. It is another miracle that anyone can write such absorbing, cozy, engrossing books.

I have been using this starter kit for almost a month and I am beginning to see results. My experience with this product has been that my skin definitely got worse before it got better. For the first few weeks, my skin seemed to explode with more acne than usual... however, last week it started to clear up rapidly. I'm still having blemishes pop up daily, but they disappear within a few days, and overall my skin is much smoother and my (many, many) scars are less visible. I have struggled with moderate to severe acne for 6 years and have tried more products and treatments than I care to remember, and decided to try Murad after it was suggested to me (I'd never heard of it before). It certainly is no "miracle" product where you see results instantly (especially if you have a moderate to severe acne problem), but I just re-ordered the starter kit and am hoping the results will continue to improve. This product is definitely worth a shot	pos

I bought this as a gift for my husband. He loves it, it works great, looks great, and the price was awesome! ---  --- The bragging points of this watch are that the face is large, the numbers are easily readable, it keeps great time because it is atomic,  and the hands and numbers glow in the dark for nighttime viewing.  ---  --- The model we bought had a metal-link silver band, and I wish I could have bought the plastic/leather band, but it was not available at the time.  The silver band looks great and my husband liked it, but for work he has to have a non-metal band. We replaced the band with a plastic/rubber one, and the watch is still looking great, and my husband can use it for work or dressy situations!   ---  --- I can't believe the great price we got this watch for. It is really a perfect watch for men. 	pos
First off, I cannot believe how mad this game has made me.  I like all kinds of games, but honestly trying to figure out some of the levels in this game left me stumped.  It's one thing to be stuck somewhere and have to retry a lot, but several times during this game I was stuck in an area and had no idea where to do/what to do, etc... even after I killed all the bad guys I didn't know how to get out of the room.  This game is not intuitive (sp?) at all! ---  --- Secondly, this game should not be called the Incredibles, it should be called Mr. Incredible, because you play as him almost all the time.  Playing as Elasta-Girl is great, I really enjoyed that part, but when there are a lot of baddies with guns, Mr. Incredible is a pain since he has no way to block anything, so you spend a lot of time getting pushed back until the bad guys reload. ---  --- I liked the first mission as Dash (when you play as Dash, which is only twice) you have to run fast; however the second mission I just lost my patience because I had to restart about a million times because I couldn't see what was ahead of me. ---  --- Playing a Violet was bad, they should have done a lot more with her instead of a boring stealth mission.  The Incredi-ball mission Incredibi-sucked, it took me like an hour to hit something because it was in a difficult place. ---  --- I'm just finishing up the game now and quite frankly I haven;'t enjoyed a lot of it, which is a shame because I really loved the movie.  Some of the levels are too hard because you can barely find the way to do something and Mr. Incredible needs to do more than punch people.  Currently I'm on the Rocket Silo level and I keep falling down trying to get onto a platform.  What a load of fun that is to do 100 times or more.   ---  --- Bottom line:  Playing as Elasta-girl was fun, everything else was either blah, or made me want to swear a lot.  Hopefully the second game will be better.  I'll be renting that instead of buying, this game left me disappointed overall	neg
The presentation of computer enhanced b&w images that in some cases were sort of new added limited value to my extensive video library, legacy of my father.

My 15 month old has been playing with this for a few months and really likes it.  He plays with it just about everyday.  Everytime we have kids come over to visit it seems to be a big hit too.  They all love trying to make baskets.   --- The flaws are that it is loud and I wish the baseball and football did more or made noise.  They don't get played with as much as the basketball part since it sings and makes crowd noises.  --- Overall it's great as long as it keeps the kids entertained!	pos
Let me start by saying that I ordered this rowing machine on April 2 and it arrived on April 5!  I was so excited! ---  --- Even though it has poor instructions on putting this machine together, it isn't impossible.  The tension strap is twisted around part of the machine that needs to be unwrapped first and that is not mentioned in the instructions.  Also, two of the steps seem to be out of order, but I still give this product a 5 star rating.   ---  --- When I was in college, I used a machine like this in their exercise room and loved it.  This is just like it, but I think it's even better.  I don't have a problem with the foot holders on this machine like I did with the one at college. ---  --- The quality is great for the value.  I feel that I have enough resistance and that I'm getting the workout that I'm looking for.  I use an elliptical rider first, then I get on my rower.  This is now rounding out my workout and I love it!  My elliptical rider is a gym quality machine and was very expensive but worth the cost.  This rower is inexpensive, but doesn't feel like a cheap machine.  Again, I am thrilled with it.  ---  --- By the way, I don't think that you can tell it in the picture, but the fan cover has holes all the way around it.  When I'm working out I can feel the breeze that it is generating.  It doesn't blow me away, but it's enough to cool me off some. ---  --- I hope you find the machine you're looking for.  If you're looking to save some money and get a great workout, this may be the rower for you. 	pos

I saw this flick when it first came out, and was chilled to the bone.  It was one of the movies that helped form my opinion about New York City, as well - as a cold, impersonal city where anonimity could swallow you up! ---  --- Over 35 years later, on review, it is still one of the scariest movies ever made. The twists are nuanced and plentiful, as well as psychologically and emotionally devastating.  Looking for monsters?  One need only look in the mirror. ---  --- Roman Polanski was - and still is, as far as I can tell - a master manipulator of perception.  Rosemary's Baby is one of his finest films, and its timeless theme - the struggle between good and evil - unfolds in a way that is as real today as it was when first released. ---  --- Oh, and I braved coming to New York 10 years after the film premiered.  Still here and loving the city!  I realized eventually, of course, that New York, as in so many films, was merely a great setting that provided a wonderful backdrop for this chilling tale to unfold.  A player in the molding of the film's atmosphere - but not the cause! It could have been set anywhere, and been just as effective. 	pos

On any list of pure English-language business reportage, BARRON'S would figure in the top ten. This newspaper-style weekly compiles more numbers than just about any other publication. ---  --- Though 'fluff' is not a word commonly associated with the Wall Street Journal, think of BARRON'S as 'WSJ without the fluff'.  That's how focused it is. ---  --- Electronic availability of business numbers has pushed BARRON'S off the 'must read' list, though it has its guild of old faithful readers who consider nothing else its equal. Published by Dow Jones, it is as focused on Wall Street as any publication could be. ---  --- Business people appreciate its 'Review  & Preview' section, which at a glance brings a reader up to speed on last week's business news leaders and next week's announcement and world holidays affecting business. ---  --- WSJ and the Economist will give you more extensive analysis. ---  --- Without slighting its columns and feature articles, BARRON'S is for the pure numbers guys and gals among us.

This was my first year using Turbotax, and it's also my last! ---  --- Since 1992 I was a faithful user of HR Block's Taxcut for Mac.  In spite of it costing more than the Windows version, I used it every year except for 1995 when various problems related to my AOL dial-up service prevented me from using it.  Since TurboTax is the only option out there for people who use a Mac, you'd think I'd be continuing to use them for now on, - but you'd be wrong! ---  --- I purchased my copy of TurboTax Deluxe from Amazon.com to save $5.  Since TaxCut made certain that no information from it's software could ever be imported by other software, I filled in my personal data as I began.  I was a little disappointed that TurboTax doesn't allow you to skip the "step-by-step" method, and just fill in the actual forms the way TaxCut did as an option.    While the downloads were an annoyance (6 or 7 separate files each time), for the most part the software was OK.  Picking up from where you leave off wasn't always possible, but 5 or 6 clicks would get you back to the right spot. ---  --- My first major annoyance came with the state software.  After filling in some data, and seeing the overall results, I wanted to look at the forms to see what they were doing with my data.  I also needed to see where they had placed data that was imported from the federal information I'd entered.  Well, there's no way to see your data on state forms until you're finished and print them out (or preview as .pdf files from the print dialogue).  When you do that the software somehow magically creates the state forms for printing, but the state forms don't seem to exist anywhere else except in that print spool!  I found this extremely annoying, and a real time waster. ---  --- The final blow, however, was when I got to filing.  The advertising is an unnecessary annoyance.  Since I don't owe any state taxes, I just usually print those forms out and mail them in --- it doesn't make any sense to me to pay for filing something when I don't owe anything and I'm not going to benefit from that "faster" refund.  Then I came to the crusher.  TurboTax wanted $30 for e-filing my Federal forms!!  TaxCut charged $14.95 and $15.95, but then they always rebated the cost.  I was told that Intuit used to do that, but obviously they decided to make some additional money this year.  Earlier in the day that I filed the saw the head of the IRS on CNBC being interviewed. He said that e-filing makes their job so much simpler.  Well, if it helps them that much, they should devise a way for computer users who buy software to file returns directly to the IRS without Intuit, H R Block and the others as middlemen.  And they should let us file for free if it makes their work so much easier. ---  --- While I have had my doubts about the services that allow you to fill out online forms, and then do your filing for you, I haven't heard of any security problems with them, so that's the direction I'm planning to take next year.  As far as I'm concerned, TurboTax blew it by being unfair with their e-filing fees	neg

I bought this hood after reading elsewhere that it fits the 50mm f/1.8 Mark I (the version with the metal mount and distance scale) that I purchased recently.  Canon specs the discontinued ES-65 hood for this lens.  The great thing about this ET-65III is that it is longer, so it blocks more stray light without vignetting on full-frame or 1/6-frame slrs.  The interior on this mark III version is also flocked, providing a bit more light absorption. ---  --- I've used those collapsible rubber hoods before while in college, but this hood is definitely worth the investment:  well built, fits backward on the lens for storage (but too long while the lens is on the camera), and provides good protection for the front of the lens (it's quite deep). ---  --- Note that this will NOT fit the newer 50mm f/1.8 Mark II version (all plastic mount with no distance scale)	pos
This is one of the worst edited documentary I have ever seen. --- You can not have a single shot spoiled with flashes, slow motion, and unnecessary digital FX.  --- I have nothing against crazy editing when it is for a 3 min MTV music clip or a TV add.

Frustration is how I sum up my experience with this product.  On the front cover, and with the directions on the back, there is a photo of a key that locks and unlocks the magnetic lock.  However, after opening the packaging, there was no key.  There were four locks, alright.  And, lots of little screws in case you felt like screwing the lock in, despite the product's claim to be the only child lock that doesn't require tools.  With how the packaging is designed, I don't even think there's room for the key.  Which makes me wonder...do you have to buy the key separately?  I'm returning this product and am bitterly disappointed for the wasted time and energy	neg

An English Teacher's review.  To my fellow educators: ---  --- I have just finished spending the better part of an afternoon watching all three film versions of "Treasure Island."  I've seen the version with Charlton Heston, the one with Jack Palance and the 1950 Disney version. ---  --- It is my unpleasant duty to report that a proper film of "Treasure Island" has apparently not yet been made, as all three were so abysmally bad that I was unable to finish them. ---  --- What no director has yet come close to capturing, is the relentless grandeur with which the book itself unfolds, and the simple directness of Stevenson's 19th century morality tale.  Without exception, all three of these films seem to flounder in a sea of confusion about what this book should actually be; and none of them seem to have even the tiniest jot of the kind of vision displayed by classic illustrators such as Wythe. ---  --- Again and again with each film, someone seems to have made the decision that the story exactly as told by Stevenson apparently wouldn't be interesting enough or exciting enough for the big screen.  What I really want to know is if any of these directors actually READ the book, or had a personal relationship with it?  I find it hard to believe that they did, since the films all give the impression of slapdash commercialism or outright confusion about what the book actually is. ---  --- Jim Hawkins is living quietly with his parents in a seaside inn, when the Captain shows up with his sea chest and a mysterious fear of "a seafaring man with one leg."  The Captain should be tall, mysterious, powerful and terrifying.  In two of these films, he seems to be played by short wrinkled winos; and in the third by some middle-aged guy who is apparently married to the lighting director's sister.  It only gets worse from there. ---  --- The tragedy of the Captain is that he is still physically vigorous and imposing at the start of the book - but Stevenson is bringing a doom to him that will shatter even the English oak of his adamant constitution - the combined forces of rum, terror and stroke. ---  --- The Captain's fate - to fall dead of a "thundering apoplexy" on the floor of the inn, forshadows the essential purpose of Stevenson's novel - to illustrate that a life of bloodthirsty avarice and short-sighted greed leads only to an ignominious death.  In the guise of a boy's adventure story, Stevenson pursues this deeper moral with a terrible purpose and with great dignity and power.  His pirate characters are not comic or lighthearted.  They are not caricatures.  They are not the wax mannequins of a Disney ride; they are real men with fears and desires and second thoughts; even with regrets.  They do not dance or traipse merrily through this story - they grimace and battle through it, gritting their teeth against the death, (from violence, sickness, treachery or rum,) that is always staring them in their faces.  Jim Hawkins' innocence and youth is the perfect foil for the pirates' hard-bitten cynicism and gold-lust.  It is no accident that, despite the courage and resourcefulness of the cabin party, (led by Captain Smollett,) it is still only Jim Hawkins' youthful optimism and curious spirit that ultimately saves them from "death at the hands of the pirates."  Stevenson is alluding to the biblical command to "be like the little children in order to be saved." ---  --- To tell this story properly, it must be told absolutely straight, and with the same committed earnestness with which Stevenson tells it.  None of these films is that brave. ---  --- To make a film that is faithful to Stevenson's moral, the director will need more courage and simplicity of purpose than we find in all three of these films combined.  Those of us who love and understand the novel for what it is must continue to hope for a film that does it justice.	neg
This product is a box o' junk.  My son got this for Christmas this year and it is not even worth whatever the person paid for it.

Sure, it's not 100% pure vanilla extract.  That's indicated quite clearly in the ingredients.  Molina vanilla is made with a mixture of pure vanilla extract and synthetic vanillin.  Personally I love its strong distinctive flavor, regardless of what percentage pure vanilla extract it is.  For those who feel it's too strong, use half the amount listed in the recipe.  I know a couple of people who do this when using Molina Vanilla.  Again, I like the flavor, so I use the full amount called for in the recipe.  This stuff has a great flavor that really kicks things up a notch	pos
The earrings delivered were as described and will certainly work for me.  I was a bit disappointed in the strength and flexibility of the gold wire.

However, they do what I need them to do and can be worn around the clock without irritation	pos
I bought one for a relative last Christmas. Saw how convenient and easy it was to program. So I bought one for myself this March. It works just great. ---  --- The setup software programs the 670 easily and the Logitech remote replaces the remotes for a HDTV, a DVD Home Theater A/V Receiver, a DishHD DVR Receiver, and a Psyclone PSC01 Source Selector.  One button click now setups all those devices to the right status for a particular entertainment activity.  ---  --- I like the color screens and icons on the higher end  Logitech remotes .. but the discrete placement of buttons on the 670 is much more practical for me to use. Function wins forms this time round. ---  --- All is not rosy though. Added the Sony PS3 to the   entertainment arena.  The Bluetooth requirements of the PS3 leaves it out of the IR RF remotes inner circle. Consider this  if you need a combined solution for Infra Red  RF as well as Bluetooth devices. ( The Sony PS3 is deliberately left powered on so it is not an issue in this case). Fully backlit is a signifcant bonus..none of the replaced remotes had adequate backlit features.  ---  --- Short version: This cool tool really works and should satisfy most. Think "out of the box" though if you have a Sony PS3 tied into your entertainment network.  ---  --- ..click	pos
My first Aquis mitt was rectangular. I like this one better.  Rounding the edges makes sense since it is meant to be worn on the hand.  Aquis microfiber is the only fabric I use on my face.

(I find it amazing that both attributes apply to the same fabric!) ---  --- If the manufacturer is listening, I would like to be able to buy the mitts in sets of 2. This would be perfect for bathing baby/children. There is a slit in the seam, on the thumb side, so your thumb can protrude. You can grip/lift without removing your mitts. Some size choices (S/M & L/XL) would be nice, as this mitt would not fit a large man's han	pos
I bought this speaker about one year ago from Best Buy, very disappointed.  The sound quality is terrible, I have two presence channel $15 KLH speakers that sound better than this.  No high end speakers have cabinets made of plastic, hence why Bose is not  high end.  After a year of misery on my ears, I've replaced this with a Paradigm center speaker that only cost $20 more, and the difference is not even comparable.  Do not buy this, or any Bose product at all.  Save your money and buy Paradigm, B&W, or similar, most of the time they cost a little bit more, but sometimes actually less and are actually high end speakers, and you will get your money's worth	neg
Peter Allen takes three of the most compelling aspects of human history--sex, disease, and religion--and weaves them together in a fascinating exposition of how religious authorities in the West have viewed  disease since the late Middle Ages. His book discusses the histories of  lovesickness, leprosy, syphilis, plague, masturbation, and of course AIDS.  For each disease (and yes, masturbation was considered a serious disease  well into the 20th Century!), he discusses how sex, and the sins associated  with it, figured into the religious and popular views of illness. Allen's  book is meticulously researched (he read texts in the original French,  Latin, German, and Italian) and elegantly  written. It is a far easier read  than most academic works. Most importantly, it offers insight into how  religious and sexual  intolerance can hamper the fight against disease,  even in today's world	pos

Whenever I think of the Second World War, the two places I usually think about in terms of carnage is the Eastern Front; and the war between Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia. The other is the Pacific Campaign between the USA and Japan. One of the reviewers wrote, "I'm glad the Russian Won." So am I. And what a bloody war it was. The number of casualties and amount of destruction make what occurred in the others parts of the globe [except Asia] seem pale in comparison. The Russians suffered greatly at the hands of the Germans, and the German army paid one hell of a steep price. ---  --- Also, it was in the east where the Germans committed some of the most horrendous atrocities known to mankind. It was in the east where extermination camps were set up to murder millions of Jews: The German  program of the 'Final Solution.' Everything I have ever read about the  Second World War concerning the eastern front is one of brutality on a scope that is horrifically mind-boggling. It's as if life were cheap and each day may have been the last. This documentary does a very decent job in attempting to address the fighting between these two armies. From Barbarossa to Berlin, it is one of the best documenatries out there. At least for the 200 minutes that the film devotes to the eastern front. I don't believe this is the definitive documentary, as more and more information is being released now that the Soviet Union is no more. But for now, I highly recommend this film.

I had to return my 1st order due to mould on the wood (around the joins) and inside the glass front. My replacement has a little mould inside the glass front, but I decided I could live with it.. I blame Amazon's storage for this rather than the manufacturing of it by LaCrosse. ---  --- The glass front is spherical, so tends to get weird light reflections, so watch for this when you are hanging it. ---  --- Note that when the battery is low, the second hand will move in 2 second jumps to let you know that the battery is low - this is a feature, not a problem, which I like. ---  --- Other than that it works great! (I live close to Boulder and NIST, where the radio signal comes from, so also take this into account when ordering any radio controlled clocks).	pos
This cereal really tastes good. I make it in the microwave, first heating the fresh cold water to boiling, then adding the cereal, stirring and returning it to the microwave to finish cooking. I let it boil and bubble for a bit in the microwave, which is when the cooking really occurs. I often let it sit in the microwave for a few minutes after it stops, to set up. Years ago a ham radio guy asked me (over the air!) whether I knew how to make gourmet microwave hot cereal. I said no - wondering how you could make anything gourmet, especially cooked cereal, in the microwave - but that I didn't express out loud... so he explained to me the above method, with emphasis on heating the cold water before adding the cereal. And definitely not using hot tap water, as that has the O2 chased out of it, or some such. So I guess that must be it! ---  --- I used to laboriously mix various cereal grains to achieve this kind of mix, but with this product it is all done for me. It's also good with raisins added. ---  --- I'm delighted that Amazon is selling some of these healthy food items that are hard to find in parts of the country. The special offers bring the price within reason.	pos
I was going to buy this and then stumbled on it in the doctor's office. I love InStyle, Lucky and other shopping mags, but the tone of this is mean and snooty. There are too many ads, and very little content. There's a Q&A section about sex after baby that's just mean, threatening that if you don't jump back in, "one of you will start sleeping with the girl in marketing..." Way to put an anti-feminist tone on sex after baby. Yuck.	neg
We bought this guitar for our smaller seven year old son. It was hard to choose a guitar, because there are so many out there...toy version and real...but which to choose?  This one is worth the pos. feedback I am giving it. It seemed so small and cute when I opened it, but it is perfect for little hands and bodies!  I found the price very reasonable since we aren't sure if he will "keep the interest",(some toy ones cost close to this) but yet I wanted him to feel like he was getting a REAL guitar, in hopes that he will keep learning.  I found that the guitar is very nice, not a toy at all, tunes well, looks very attractive and sounds nice too.  I was impressed that it came with a warranty.  I am happy that I didn't spend close to this for the toy versions...and I got the real deal instead.  Shipping was INCREDIBLY fast from this company	pos

After hearing a lot of the songs used for other Fisher Price music toys, I expected the best from this one. I liked the songs included on the rom, but I expect a nice beat and catchy tune. (Like the Backyardigans or the Doodle Bops). These songs are performed in a dry sort of way. They aren't even as good as the Wiggles and my kids hate the Wiggles. It was a bit disappointing	neg
It is difficult to use words harsh enough to describe this product and this company. --- I have owned this software for about 80 days.  --- 1. In 80 days of use this product has completely locked up or not opened twice. --- 2. I have called the 'support' line 4 times. The minimum time I was on hold was 40 minutes. --- 3. My initial 'support' period is about to expire and I now will have to pay $200 to get more 'support' --- 4. You have to buy additional software to get your data onto a palm device. ---  --- In summary: The product has locked up about every 40 days and the average hold time is 40 minutes when you call them. ---  --- Save yourself the grief - buy nothing or buy something else	neg
This worked great for a couple months.  Then the monkey that moves up and down started making a loud clicking noise.  The gears must be slipping.  My poor baby gets really excited to kick the parrot to make the monkey move, then gets scared at the loud clicking/popping noise and starts crying.  Really sad	neg

I was able to reach the top of the windows in my two story foyer with this wonderful product. I need to point out I am 5'4".  I did need the assistance from my boyfriend (who is 6'1") to reach the ceiling to remove the cobwebs...but he did it and they are GONE!   --- I just received my Simple Clean today and I have already tried three attachments. The ceiling fan attachment worked well. I used the duster to dust my window panes in my foyer as well as my fragile lighting. LOVED IT! We also used the spider web remover and it was great! I recommend this product to everyone!	pos
After breaking the collective hearts of the soft rock-loving populace by leaving the powerhouse group Chicago, Traitor Cetera made a half-baked attempt to reconcile himself with his fanbase by recording this stinker.  It's coincidental that the first track is titled "Big Mistake", as if Traitor knew his leaving one of the premier groups of our time was the worst decision he would ever make.  I bought this album way back in 1986 with some birthday money, and after I had listened to the album once, I made myself go and apologize to all of my family members for wasting their money so foolishly. ---   --- What else is here?  Oh, you have the "Karate Kid II" ballad "Glory of Love", a tune so nauseating it's made me completely ignore the second film in the canon, and go straight from the original "Karate Kid" to "III" and "Next" whenever I do my yearly film marathon.  I just pretend the second film never existed.  It also has the semi-smash "Next Time I Fall", where Traitor makes it a point to hog the spotlight completely from guest vocalist Amy Grant. ---   --- In short, if you a) thought Cetera's leaving Chicago was a great decision, or b) like your music pointless and nauseating, by all means get this album.  If you want music with real heart and soul, just go buy some Chicago.  You'll be glad you did	neg

Looks nice... but beware! ---  --- Installed Norton 360 on the 6 workstations in our small office.  As soon as I did that our accounting system (Peachtree) started to lock up a few times a day.  Even after turing off the firewall on all workstations the accounting system still locked up. ---  --- I've now uninstalled Norton 360 on the server PC and that seems to have solved the problem. ---  --- I wish now that I had just upgraded from Norton Internet Security 2005 to 2007...  Never again.	neg
I bought this for my son's second Christmas; he was almost 2.  It was a recommendation of one of my parenting magazines and I had to hunt it down 3 years ago.

This makes a great cake or cupcakes. I used a modification to make it a chocolate cake & it was a hit, and also baked them in little bear molds -- the kids loved them.

This SUPER BRIGHT light is great!   ---  ---      * Its solar (no need to string wires from the house) ---      * It has a VERY bright light (sometimes solar lights can be on the weak side, but not this one) ---      * A person could attach it to other places outside to -- it does a great job peircing through the dark night. ---  --- DEFINIITELY A MUST OWN IF YOU HAVE A SHED OR DARK SPOT IN THE BACKYARD	pos
I regret having purchased this product.  I have not been able to use it for two months, after finally giving up trying to get it to work.  I have a very nice laptop running Windows XP Home, and encountered many problems.  I tried all of the avenues available to me through QuickBooks, online, via email, and on the telephone.  I spent nearly 25 hours overall trying to get the numerous issues taken care of.  Here are just a few:  The program would not convert my Quicken data; random script errors when you try to access help topics within the product; the phone # provided in the payroll demo is invalid; None of my info was viewable after bank download - it spontaneously failed to download my bank account info, after having successfully downloaded it for about two weeks.  I spent 2 & 1/2 hours on the phone trying to resolve just this one issue.  Part of the problem lies in the fact that I was unable to speak to a customer service person who's first language was English.  Each time I was on the phone, the customer service person seemed to continually ask me to re-describe the problem, then he/she would seem to be typing the info into the computer and waiting....then eventually telling me some solution to try, then eventually telling me they did not know what the problem was.  Not helpful in any way, though very polite. I'm sorry to say that this is a terribly designed, convoluted, over-complicated, non-user-friendly item which I would like to toss over a cliff. 	neg
This film having been produced in 1957, was seen by me in 1958 while serving as a D.I. AT P.I. It showed for two consecutive nights and I think every D.I. on P.I. somehow arranged to see it. We wanted to see if they got it right I guess. I viewed it again recently and it was most nostalgic. A most memorable time and the film was reasonably accurate for the times. I highly recommend it	pos
I am very pleased with the locket.  It is a nice size, but not too big-definitely large enough to be engraved. The chain is pretty and appears to be strong.  It arrives in a lovely black velvet pouch and box.  My daughter was delighted with it	pos
I ordered this phone on 3/28/07. It shipped via FEDEX on 3/29/07 to my office with an indicated delivery of 3/2/07. The package sat on the FEDEX truck for three days before they attempted to deliver it at 8pm to an adjacent business and then left it without the package being signed for. This was after I'd already called FEDEX to refuse delivery of the package because it was too late in arriving.  FEDEX's response for it sitting three days on the delivery truck was that the driver was overloaded.  For the $100 difference in price it was less hassle to just go to the local Cingular store.	neg
the cap is nice and presumably does what it is suppose to do by keeping my hair out of my face. However, the stitching at the seam at the back of the cap began coming apart from the day that I first used it. It hasnt torn completely...yet.

The necklace is great.  It looks great and my wife loved it.  One of the diamonds was a little gray (something stuck behind it), but after having it cleaned at a jewelers, it looks fantastic. --- Great price for a great item	pos
This is a thuroughly enjoyable movie; a pleasure to watch. THe acting, characters, and story are entirely plausible, and there is no grandstanding by primadonna actors, nor is there any of Hollywood's usual political preachiness (especially unusual considering Robert Redford's backing).  ---  --- THe only downside to the DVD is that it is full-screen, and not letterboxed. THe "bonus features" are somewhat lack-luster as well, and the menu system is laughable. Only one actor's credits have been updated since the movie was released, and the credits section is a token gesture at best. ---  --- Still, this is one of those cases where it is cheaper to buy the movie than rent it twice	pos
I'm probably going to invest in a re-order of this DVD collection, because I simply have worn this one out. From the "They Call It Pro Football" opening to final gun of Super Bowl X, this collection grips your attention and never lets go. The writing is superb - I especially like NFL 68' - and The highlights... Well, it was when pro football was pro football.  ---  --- It was interesting watching teams endure psychological hardships, as was the Case with the Dallas Cowboys of the late 60's- Early 70's. "Next Year's Champions" were the epitome of resiliency.   ---  --- "The Championship Chase" was a pure joy to view. If ever there was a peak in John Facenda's narrative career with NFL Films, this was it; though in the alternative, I loved his voice-overs in Super Bowls III, IV, VII, and IX.   ---  --- Ed and Steve Sabol Really hit the bulleye with Blair Motion Pictures. I would have loved to see more AFL highlights, but that's just nit-picking.  ---  --- GREAT JOB!!!	pos

I have to tell anyone, who has lower back or foot pain, to try a pair of Merrells.  When you try them on, they feel comfortable, but once you wear them for a week, you'll never wear another brand of footwear (unless you have to).  Most of their shoes need no "break in" time.  I own these in four different colors.  My eldest daughter owns two pairs of these. I own more than 20 pairs of Merrells, I have been wearing these for years.  The cool thing about them is, when you see someone else wearing a pair, it's like you're both in on a secret.  You know, you're walking in heaven	pos

After many disastrous leakage experiences with their smaller-size diapers, I decided to give Huggies another try because I have a very active toddler, and these certainly did appear to be stretchy and comfortable. Unfortunately, this comfort comes at the expense of utility. My daughter was no sooner running around in the first diaper out of the pack, when I saw the entire contents of her diaper coming out the sides and up her back. Just like the smaller sizes, this version does not hold anything in!!!	neg

Years ago 'The Sporting News' was the fans' 'bible'. I can remember what a special feeling it gave to look at it, the real lowdown, the most bottom- line stuff , more statistics than even the greatest baseball nut could ever remember.  --- I no longer really follow the game, or any of the games as I once did. --- And most of the figures even the names of the players are strange to me now.  --- I picture in my mind my uncle the late Broadway Abe Freedman who lived his life to see the Yankees lose , picking up this paper and cursing at some columnist proclaiming the Yankees the favorites to take it all in the coming year. --- That coming year and so many coming years are already gone.  --- But there will be a next year, a next season, another Sporting News' and someone somewhere in America devouring those numbers as if they were crackers jack and cold beer at the seventh- inning stretch.	pos

Ok-I did not review any of the other comments on this game before posting this. I have been playing Final Fantasy games for a very long time... I still have (and play :p) Mystic Quest, Final Fantasy II and FF III for SNES.  ---  --- FF XII is the BEST Final Fantasy since #3 (US), in my opinion...and it is FUN!!!! The story line is AWESOME (kinda like Shakespeare meets King Arthur) and it reminds me a bit of final fantasy 3...only with awesome graphics! ---  --- My one peeve for all of the games was leveling up (HP and MP.) I felt like after I mastered the "new" way of doing it-they changed it for the next game!!! The old games did it automatically...after those, you had to equip things in order to gain strength, magic, and special abilities. This game combines what you have already learned from FF VII on...and if you have never played the game, there is a great tutorial that you can access at any time. ---  --- This game is just plain FUN...I think the MOST fun since FF III. You have the freedom to explore and wander without getting lost (there is a reminder at the bottom of the map and X's to show you where to go), you can see whatever you come into contcact with (friends and foes), and the storyline and gameplay are phenomenal	pos

I did not finish the book (I got about 70% of the way through before I realized I could not bear to read one more page).  Maybe the remaining part of the book would have been better, but I doubt it.  This is the first time I can ever remember not even having even the slightest interesting in finishing a book.  The characters were flat and plot went nowhere.  Please - there are million of books out there.  Spare yourself, and find something else to read. Anything.	neg
I've been using Quicken for Windows for years.  Since I recently bought a Mac, I thought I'd switch Quicken over from Mac to Windows.  Forget it!  The Mac version is totally incompatible with Windows, you must export your data and then re-import it on the Mac.  This works OK for simple checking / Visa accounts, but it **fails completely** for investment or brokerage accounts.  If you look on Quicken's support site, they say "Reinvest Dividend, Reinvest Income and banking transactions in an investment account must be *manually entered*"  Hello?!  Like I'm going to manually enter 12 years of investment transactions?  With most major products (Adobe Creative Suite, MS Office), the same files work transparently across Mac and Windows.  Quicken's inability to even import the data, nevermind actually opening it, reeks of incompetence.  Stay away from this product	neg
I stumbled across this little gem almost by accident, and what a surprise it was.  The sheer breadth of subject matter could span half a lifetime.  We never forget the lessons of our youth, and each issue, like a great short story, will separate you from the mundane and transform the way you view literature.   And yes, you will return...time and time again. Are you trying to decide whether to devote your summer to reading Anna Karenina?  Perhaps it will ignite in you a love for the Great Russian novels, providing fodder that, like all firm foundations, could change the course of your life.  If it's the modern classics that you're interested in, one almost can't help but think along the lines of John Knowles.  Life marches on, and we choose whether to change or be changed.  Much is out of our control in this world, but what we choose to read is not. Regardless of your personal paradigm, you will find much of interest in this cleverly constructed work.   While the idea of a Holiday gift might seem obvious, why not consider surprising and old friend with a subscription? Does your friend really need that Springsteen coffee table tome?  Even as a belated wedding gift, it would no doubt be appreciated.  Don't stand around in bookstores, Starbucks in hand, flipping through page after page anymore...Oh, you don't do that, huh?  No, neither do I.  Just subscribe now.  I hope to find one in my mailbox soon. ---  --- -Timothy McPhail, Avondale Estates, GA	pos

I'm not sure quite what to say about the burners.  As expected, they work extremely well, and they were rather easy to install.

This is my second item of this type, and in the wintertime it is indepensible. With no garage to keep my SUV in, this cover fills the void.

 ---  --- Mistral, as many know, is a powerful, gusty wind that blows across the south of France. Mistral, as I was happy to discover, is also the name of a line of bath and body products, all French inspired, all lusciously lovely from scented soaps to soothing lotions to rejuvenating body butters.  ---  --- Matthew Tilker, founder and president of Mistral, utilizes Shea butter, which is an efficacious natural healer, in a myriad of must-have forms. Derived from the nuts of the African Shea Tree (according to sacred custom the nuts are harvested primarily by women), this butter is highly emollient, a boon for those with dry skin, chapped lips, any number of skin irritations.  ---  --- The pure Shea Butter soap comes in a plethora of inviting fragrances, all milled six times (while others boast being triple milled). South Seas is a particular favorite - it's as fresh as an ocean breeze and as calming, soothing as a tropical island. The marine scent is accented with a touch of grapefruit, white flowers and soft woods. An irresistible combination.  ---  --- South Seas is a fragrance with which you wish to surround yourself - made possible by the shower gel, body lotion, massage bath and body oil, bath salts and candle all available at very accessible prices.  ---  ---      - Gail Cooke	pos
I have been completely satisfied with Jansport backpacks.  They are very well made and I love the guarantee.  The straps are more comfortable than other backpacks purchased.  My 14 year old son has had one for three years, and it is still in great condition.  Previous cheaper backpacks have lasted a year or two at the most.  This model has lots of zipper pockets in different sizes for storing just about anything you'd want to put in a backpack.  Great product	pos
My cousin loves these dolls.

 --- These burgers are unbelievable. They are really fresh and juicy burgers with a distinctive meaty taste you will fall in love with if you love a great burger.  They are Omaha Steaks best product and the only thing I order from them. I actually love the packaging. Each burger comes individually wrapped in vacuum sealed plastic, which means I can keep them in the freezer until I am ready to eat them. Then defrost them in warm water and in 10 minutes I have fresh red meat, they have a nice peppery Angus beef smell, and they taste great. They never go to waste.  I find the meat I buy in the stores these days can't compare at all. Them smell of the meat doesn't smell fresh - more like plastic than meat. Ok, the Styrofoam cooler is a waste of packaging, and not environmentally friendly but they can be reused several times. ---  --- Amazon also has a great price on these. After a quick search around the web, this looks to be the best price	pos
My primary camera is a Sony HDR-FX1. --- I bought the GL-2 as a second unit for multiple camera angles at sporting events. --- The GL-2 is a respectable camera but in my opinion the video image doesn't even come close to the Sony. --- The price and rebate offer was the greatest incentive in my purchase of this camera. --- However, beware of the rebate offer. --- I sent all the documents in strict compliance with the terms of the rebate only to have it rejected. --- The rebate facilitator claimed I did not include the UPC code. --- If I had it to do over, I would dig deeper into my wallet and buy a second Sony	neg

I bought the Rebel XT w/ the 18-55 lens exactly 18 hours before the XTI was introduced, but that's another story. As this is my first DSLR, I was blown away by the results. But after the initial euphoria, there is always room for improvement. My first choice was the 28-200, favoring the longer zoom over the IS, but I found this one used at Penn Camera and got a deal on it and a 380EX flash, so the decision was made for me.  --- I like the zoom range, it's great for framng portraits. If I need wider angle, I still have the kit lens.  --- I won't make the usual complaints about the herky-jerky zoom ring or the rackety extension tubes, as I was prepared for this by these reviews before I ever saw the lens. --- I'm no expert on sharpness, and still trying to get myself dialed in, but my shots so far look pretty sharp to me. I have no "L" lenses to compare to, nor would I make the comparison if I did.  --- In my somewhat uninformed opinion, this is a great step up from the kit lens. This is a lens a working guy can afford and most likely get great results with. Being a working guy, I'm extremely happy with it so far, and glad I made the purchase. 	pos

Hermann Baumann is one of the greatest horn players ever and he shows why he has been given that honor on this cd. I don't think that there is recording of the Haydn concerto that even comes close to this masterful performance, even better than Tuckwell's. The cadenzas are absolutely awesome. I haven't listened to the Rosetti before but Baumann sounds excellent in this concerto as well. Clevenger plays ok on the Haydn but his articulation is a little sloppy. I'm a saxophone player but I can recognize  true musicianship when I hear it and Baumann certainly is a brilliant musician. Highly recommended	pos

Our daughter received this puzzle for her 3rd birthday.  She's a puzzle nut!  This became an instant favorite and had to be left together for all to see.  The picture sheet in it labels all the sea creatures and it becomes a great way to discuss the different levels of life in the ocean.  The coloring is beautiful - Mom and Dad enjoy it as well.  It is extrememly well built, sturdy and can really be wiped off with a damp cloth. ---  --- The only negative, as another viewer pointed out, is the darker bottom pictures.  Harder for young ones to distinguish designs and not as visually appealing.	pos
I liked how you could go underwater and try to find things. I also liked how you had to bake cookies and make sundaes. Another really cool thing was that you could buy stuff for Minette and yourself. I didn't like how the tea was so hard,though.I couldn't figure it out,but finally I got it.I liked that you had to fight Minette,too.It was funny that she had an alien tatoo on her face.Over all,Danger By Design was a fun game.	pos
This is the candy our two boys ask for the most. And their friends (and their parents) love them, too.  We gave them out for Halloween and had rave reviews back from neighbors.

The product is compact and convenient, but it feels flimsy.  The hotsync function stopped working for a bit but was restored after I did a hard reset of my Palm TX--so it was not a cable problem but a problem with my TX.

Ok. I can say I have been a realtor, a nurse,an HR person, a mom. That means a heavy phone user- since 1990. My first phone was the old motorola brick analog. One of the greatest and biggest phones ever. I remember my first digital phone, and first pnone with games. I have had a total of 5 phones, motorola, nokia, ericson, panasonic. This kyocera is the best. I don't want a treo palm because I already travel with a lap top. What I want is a text phone that is small and easy to use. This querty key board rocks. The menu is just like a computer and easy to make selections. The more features you need on the phone, the more you want a qwerty key board. Get this phone and be happy. Also the saleslady threw it on the ground and when the back came off she snapped it back on and used it. Very sturdy little phone, and the antena is the loop so it won't poke you. Comes with  a very easy to read guide book so start up is easy. I paid $199 for this phone in my region and it is worth every penny	pos

The chocolate crunch is my favorite of the gluten-free Nana's cookies, though the lemon is pretty good too.  I have a feeling the person who gave these 1 star is someone who can eat a freakin' cinnabon if she wants to.  For those of us who have dietary restrictions, it's a different story.   ---  --- It does take a while to get used to gluten free fare, but these cookies are among the best I've had, which is pretty impressive since they don't even have sugar in them.  And the fact that they don't have gluten, eggs, nuts, or dairy in them either is wonderful (yes, there are those of us out there allergic to all these things).  I just wish more stores carried them.  But now that I've found them on Amazon, I'll be ordering in bulk. ;	pos
I absolutly love ALL of Carol's daughter's products.  Everything to me is true to description.  I recieved my Almond Cookie gift set in the mail and I couldnt wait to open it. The smell is to die for, sometimes I open my Shea Souffle' just so I can smell it. I also love her labels and containers.  I will forever be a customer of Carol's Daughter and I look forward to the day where I can walk into one of her stores. Her prices are worth every dime. Remember you get what you pay for	pos

Both versions of Scansoft cause my installer to have problems. Mainly it tries to re-install Softscan every time I start up Softscan. Also It has started to try and reinstall Softscan if I try to right click on a JPG. There is very little to no chance of getting any help from Scansoft (Nuance)to debug this problem. Save your money and buy some thing else	neg
I honestly don't see why people would give this camera less than 4 stars. The moment I got it, I was delighted with the quality of the pictures (except in very dark places - which is why the review gets minus 1 star), and by its portability. ---  --- I've dropped it, abused it, took it to countless parties, countries and it is now FULL of scratches and bumps (GET THE CAMERA CASE!), and guess what: it still works as perfectly as the first day I got it. This little piece of technology is amazing, so if you're looking for something affordable and with a great picture quality (for us amateurs, of course) just go for it. ACtually, I even took quite a few gorgeous pictures with it. I even love it and rely on it so much that I won't change it even now that it looks all messed up. ---  --- Don't think twice. Just go for it	pos
Though not bleeding edge, CA gives a good overview of what's happening in the field now.  Only complaint is that the Annuals sometimes seem to be in a rut with similar or same folks featured again and again	pos
Ahh, the Tekken series. Probably the most influential series of 3D fighting games outside of the Virtua Fighter games. Tekken 5 is a welcome return to form for this true master of the genre. With the 4th game just a distance memory, this takes the series forward (or back, depending on how you look at things). Tekken 5 uses the tried and trusted Tekken gameplay, while still making everything feel fresh. Characters, that once before were just mere clones of certain main ones, are now fully fleshed out - with moves of their own. Anna Williams for example, is now not a clone of her sister Nina.  ---  --- When people mention Tekken, they usually think of people who have mastered every single command and move, while spending hours upon hours practising to hone their 'mad skillz' - as it were. Making the game unplayable for beginners to the genre. This, I think, is far from the truth. Tekken 5 welcomes new and veterans to the series alike. Whereas button-bashing pretenders to Tekken's crown, coughDeadorAlivecough, leave you feeling somewhat cold. Tekken on the other hand leaves you feeling a great sense of satisfaction when you play. Yes, Tekken 5 has its button-bashing characters - but every single character IS unique... and how unique they look! Arguably the best looking PS2 game to date. With gorgeous backdrops, fluid, realistic animation and textures that would look at home on any next-gen console. ---  --- Music wise, it's back to form mix between techno/dance we've come to know and love from Tekken. The least we say about Tekken 4's music the better! You've got your usual Story mode to run through with each character. To see why they've entered the tournament, etc. But this 5th edition borrows the human AI mode of Virtua Fighter 4. This has replaced the Arcade mode in name, and pits you against humans who have uploaded/downloaded their data from the Tekken arcade machine from all over the world. It's a welcome challenge, even though it doesn't even compare to facing a real-life human opponent. All-in-all, this is the true homecoming of a master. Easily the best Tekken to date, and probably the best 3D fighter in existence. Though I am partial to abit of Soul Calibur... heh	pos
I wanted to try a new lipgloss because all of the colored ones that I have are horrificly sticky and if they aren't sticky they do not stay on for long.  This one however, manages to combine my love for lipgloss with all the needs of a chapstick.  The color (apple a day) was intimidating looking in the tube but looks perfectly on and doesn't go anywhere.  It also has NO STICKYNESS!  YAY!  I love this gloss and is the perfect gloss for all of my needs!	pos

I have used this system for 9 weeks now.  The bottle will leak if you do not tighten the ring enough or correctly - I test shake before I feed and if its wrong I unscrew and reseat the nipple.  My daughter has less gas with these bottles than with the Playtex bottles I tried.  If your child gags as one reviewer commented you need a slower nipple.  I use the standard nipples and not the adjustable flow nipples.  I have the adapter system that allows me to pump into the bottle and I like the convenience of being able to cap that bottle when done and refrigerator it until feeding time.  These bottles do well in the dishwasher and clean up easily	pos

I've tried 15-20 different k-cups and would rate Timothy's Parisian Night (can you say French Roast) in the top third.  At the 7.25 oz setting it makes a full-bodied, dark brew with a nutty, almost earthy taste.  It's very much a European-style blend, and with a dash of half and half makes a passable Viennese 'brauner.	pos

Through luck of genetics, I have dark circles. I've had them since as far back as I can remember. No amount of sleep, eat well, or generally good lifestyle choices changed my dark circles.  ---  --- I was pretty hesitant to try it out, since, woah... $95 is a lot of money, but I gave it a shot. I used it exactly per the instructions. ---  --- I was actually pretty discouraged because I didn't see a change, but then BAM, in the 3rd week of using it, I woke up and my circles were soooo much noticably lighter. I could cry. It's hard being so young and having dark circles under your eyes, but now I  look more my age. And I'm still only in the 3rd week, so I have a lot of hope for the product.  ---  --- I feel badly for the people who didn't get a reaction, but as they state in their pamphlet, it will not work on 100% of people. Like anything, really, won't work for 100% of people.  ---  --- But it worked for me, and I'm so very happy. I would have paid sooo much more for these results.	pos
I have had this winder for about a month now and I am very happy with it. The major convenience is the well-engineered slots and iserts holding watches that are of a very good quality. The inserts are holding watches steadily which contributes to proper winding. All previous more expensive winders with cushion type inserts were falling out (with watches!)and eventually were rendered useless. Highly recommended unit	pos
House 1 is darker than it's sequels but stll maintains the horror/comedy feel throughout.   ---  --- Don't expect to be blown away by outlandish Hollywood special effects. The majority of the special effects are not special.  But if you can get over that, you'll enjoy the movie. ---  --- DVD is pretty bare bones with no amazing special features. I doubt much of that was available due to the age of the film. I'm just happy it was released on DVD! ---  --- If you are a fan of low budget horror/comedy movies this movie may appeal to you. It's no Evil Dead, but it is an entertaining movie. 	pos
This magazine really fills the voids that design school leaves behind.  I have developed some serious guts in fighting for what I am worth due to this publication.  When you are a new designer, you get taken advantage of  frequently.  College did not prepare me to stand up for myself in this competitive market, and this magazine not only keeps you up-to-date with the latest in the design realm, but also serves as a gutsy, motivational read as well.  This is a must have subscription for budding designers. What a relief to read a killer design publication from the midwest	pos

I purchased the canon powershot s500 digital elph last March. I kept getting blurry pictures so I called Canon technical support. They went through the whole procedure to make sure my camera was all set up. Well I followed their directions but everything was the way it should have been. So they said I should send it in because there was obviously a problem with it. Then I sent it in and had to pay for the shipping there. They sent it back and said they had switched out some optical thing. Well I just finally went to get my pictures developed and they all have the same problem. They never fixed the problem. Mind you this was the approximately 9 months of my son's life before the age of 2. I called tech support and ended up having to wait more than 24 hours for a call back from a supervisor. She said they would send me pre paid envelope to check out the camera. Well I was greatful and had to tell her that during babysitting in late August a little boy had dropped my camera so there was damage to the outside part of the camera, but it did not effect the quality of the pictures because they were the same as prior to the day it was dropped. She said that they would probably not cover it due to the fact that it might have been caused by the dropped camera. I told I have proof of when it happened and that the pictures prior to that date are coming in blurry just like it was before I sent it in the first time. I started to cry that my son's 9 months are all ruined and she was practically laughing when I got off the phone. The camera is worse than a disposable camera. Don't waste your time or money on this piece of junk. I recommend Olympus. My Olympus prior to this was only 3 megapixels and was better quality than this piece of junk. I am planning on contacting the Better Business Bureau regarding this matter. Please don't waste your time on this, like I have to! I hope this helps people make better choices! Good luck! I wish someone could have forecasted this for me	neg
I purchased this mouse 5 months ago and it has been total frustration ever since. The buttons on the sides are not easy to access or use. But most frustrating is the way the two main buttons perform. When I clicked on them they end up double clicking which caused a lot of problems with retrieving my email messages. I know some may be thinking I haven't configured the settings correctly but I went over it several times and couldn't get it to work right.  What's even more frustrating is the support at Razer is non-existent. They never responded to my email questions which I submitted several times before giving up. I ended up buying a Wacom Intuos 3 tablet which works amazingly well and gives me so much more. I am a commercial illustrator so it is the perfect mouse/pen tool for my needs.  ---  --- Don't buy this product. I would have given it a negative 5 stars if that were an option. At $43.65, it's a steep price to pay for the frustration and a complete waste of time and money	neg
Very interesting spoof of the original game.  I found the first one boring after a few plays, but this one still interests my kids and I after 10+ plays.  It's a bit convoluted to put it together initially, but well worth it	pos

Our 2-year-old loves Thomas the Train, so this was a great gift for her. She has other Thomas items, but they're limited to playtime. This, however, is not only good for playtime, but safe enough for her to take to bed with her (she even kicked her Elmo out to make room for Thomas!). It's also small enough for her to be able to take on car rides. A great all around item to have if you've got a child that's really into Thomas	pos

My kids (4.5 and 1) love this car. The sounds it makes are great. They take turns riding on it and the other one pushing. It is quite durable and they play with it all the time. Only negative is that some of the stickers peeled off. Overall, it's a great toy and the kids play with it every day	pos

I've used version 2003 and enjoyed it thoroughly.  I primarily used it for school with different classes and notes for each.  What was great is that is consolidates everything in a way that makes it easy to retrieve your notes. It also makes it easy to generate reports based on the tagging feature.  The tags allow you to highlight and gather key points of information that make writing papers a breeze.  When working with paper, this was not always an easy task to take on. ---  --- Several weeks ago, I downloaded the trial version of OneNote 2007.  The improvements are rather subtle, but powerful.  It didn't take anything to get comfortable with the new features.  After a short time with the trial version I just purchased it because it was so much fun.  ---  --- Here are some of the beneficial features: ---  --- -Like a paper notebook you have sections, but with OneNote 2007 you can have as many sections as you like. ---  --- -You can easily link pages to Outlook. I have linked appointments to a series of notes and support files for various projects and meetings. It makes being organized for a meeting a breeze. ---  --- -Also, it's a great way to archive emails in a way that allows you to see them and organize them as you wish.  You can empty your in box and at the same time keep a record of important emails.  Well worth your time. ---  --- -It is also tablet friendly if you use a tablet PC like I do.  I love it for that use.  There is a fantastic text recognition feature that works EXTREMELY well. If you use a tablet, this is a great feature. ---  --- -As was with the earlier version, you can add voice content to your notes. That's right, voice recorded messages can be added to your notes.  Too cool. ---  --- Before you buy, you might want to go to the Microsoft site and download the trial version.  You'll be able to assess for yourself.  I think you'll be pleased.  I fond it to be one of the best products for 'electronic file keeping' that I've used.  For the price, it's not a bad deal.	pos
Billy Elliot is an 11 year old who does poorly in the boxing ring but surprisingly well in ballet class (meeting with the boxers because of building shuffling needed during a coal miners strike). ---  --- This is the classic "family doesn't initially understand," "teacher believes in him," "screws up audition but spirit carries him through" type movie.  It's put together quite nicely, and you never really know how it is going to turn out. ---  --- The transition from ballet dancing to tap/jazz seemed to happen in one day, which seemed jarring. ---  --- The beginning of Swan Lake, with Billy as the lead and family and friends in attendance, 10 years or so later, was a real "feel good" part of the movie	pos
Don't listen to all that crap about how you should get Linux or buy a Mac instead of buying Windows. That will probably be the dumbest choice in your life.

Buyer beware. These new Journey releases are reissues of their 1996 remastered releases. They are NOT remastered in 2006. Rhino should be ashamed of itself for this (it's been 10 years - I would have gladly paid for a remastered version, but not for new packaging)	neg

While the product works it's good.  It was capabable of trimming eyebrows, sideburns, beards & mustaches, and that pesty stray nosehair.

Okay, I will admit to liking Poor Tom, Bonzo's whatever (it sure beats Moby Dick!) and Wearing and Tearing, but other than that this is a collection of outtakes that should've stayed outtakes. Low points include We're Gonna Groove, the live I Can't Quit You Baby, Walter's Walk and Ozone Baby. It's a shame that Traveling Riverside Blues and Hey Hey, What Can I Do were left off this album, and included only in the boxed set reissue - it's the only place you can find Hey Hey, What Can I Do, one of my favorite Zeppelin songs, and with Riverside Blues, you have a choice: Shell out $100 to get it, or sit through the crappy BBC Sessions album. If you're obsessed with the band, I guess this would be good for you. But the best version of Coda is in the aforementioned $100 boxed set.	neg
I couldn't resist the very feminine and retro look of the packaging. And it does look cute in the bathroom. That being said this is great to add a layer of sheen to the legs. Your calves look great without stockings. I find it too waxy to use on the rest of the body but there's nothing better on bare legs. To add a glow to the skin, especially to a tan, try Benefit's Flamingo Fancy	pos

After reading the other reviews of this product, I felt confident enough to go ahead and buy it as a gift for an 8 year old boy. He is learning multiplication tables now, so I figured this was a great present.  ---  --- Unfortunately, once the batteries were in, it kept malfunctioning and when the dials were twisted to 2 numbers, it would read out two totally different numbers and give their result instead of the 2 numbers the dials showed. We tried over and over to get it to work, but it is a DUD! ---  --- I live overseas so returning it is not an option I am willing to pay the extra freight/duty for. I bought another Leap Frog product at the same time that I have not given as a present yet, I really hope it works	neg
Logic problems really helped me prepare for college. Many of my courses required critical thinking and writing. When I first started doing logic problems, I was terrible!

I was really looking forward to these pods based on the reviews.  Starbucks is good, but I prefer bolder taste.... imagine my surprise when I ordered 2 boxes - both were expired! One expired back in 2005 for gosh sakes.  I admit that Amazon agreed to credit me for cost plus part of shipping, but geez, 2 years expired!!!  I'm hoping to find local San Diego area shoppe that carries pods so that I can try something different than starbucks	neg
I've recently swapped from sitting at a desk (which I have done for nearly 20 years) to working at a "stand-up" desk. I found that standing on office carpets, even while wearing comfortable shoes, was tough - I would barely last 5 to 10 minutes. And the accumulative effects were enough that I doubted I would get acclimatized anytime soon. ---  --- Having tried this mat for a week now, I found that I can stand on it for 20 minutes or more at a time straight away. And even at the end of the 20 minutes my feet don't feel bad - I am just sitting at that point because I am sick of standing, not because I have to sit. ---  --- Rather than move the mat out of the way, I am allowing my chair to roll over it. It is not conducive to rolling (being a high chair I don't have the leverage to move it much even on the normal carpet - on the mat I have no hope). When I move the chair away, I can see definite indents in the mat where the wheels were, however these spring back within 5 minutes or so. ---  --- This has been an excellent purchase as far as I am concerned	pos
Feeding the cat...those girls shold put on a sweater. Love this movie, 50's detective noir set in 70's California. The beach, the hospital, Mexico, the supermarket, it's all great - and the theme song keeps going throughout over and over. Final scene pays homage to The Third Man, beautiful. A bit of violence, but "That's how I treat someone I love, and I don't even like you". Never seen an Elliot Gould movie I like more than this, & it's my favorite Altman as well	pos
Ms. Melua is from Georgia.  Her voice is quite like the Swede, Lisa Ekdahl.  Neither has range or power; both have a little girl voice and plenty of finesse.  Both have musical partners.  In Ms. Melua's case it is Mike Batt who is to her what Nelson Riddle was to Linda Rondstadt, except that, in addition to arranging and conducting and coaching, he writes songs.  Most of this album are her and/or his songs.  They are well written and well treated.  They are are a careful team abnd do not cut corners.  Mr. Batt, among many other things, worked with Steeleye Span and Art Garfunkel long ago. ---  --- The original sogs are interesting and liquid pleasant in rendition.  But my favorite cut is her rendering "Blues in the Night", which some might remember from Looney Tunes cartoons many decades past; "My mama done tole me..." it starts.  Knowing she cannot belt it, instead she works it. ---  --- One short note on Steve Sale's engineering because another reviewer was crabbing about reverb and above all, clipping.  Perhaps because I bought it on vinyl, but I hear none of these defects.  My set is revealing, and it reveals excellent engineering, considering the largeish ensemble Mr. Batt has assembeled.  Fear not, unless the CD really is badly made	pos
This card works exactly as stated by StarTech. I bought two - one for a PC and one for a Mac, popped 'em in and plugged in iPods, external hardrives, a scanner, and digital cameras and the cards worked perfectly.

...yes, the Beatles by which I'm not comparing Supergrass to them. No, Supergrass are riding the road built by not only The Beatles, but other British rock'n'roll greats like The Kinks, David Bowie, The Zombies and many others. But the exploding energy of Supergrass delivers a deeply satisfying listen that does not exist as frequently in the present 2000's. This will definitely be a group that will represent the virtouso side of British rock'n'roll of the 1990's and 2000's, and without doubt represent the Bohemia-Intellectual-Hard Rocking spark that has lighten recent generations that has been going on since Circa-Sgt. Pepper. An intoxicating and highly addictive album. 100% recommended for anyone any age.	pos

So Far, So Good...So What! (in it's origional form) used to conjure feeling.

Oh dear. This is another book like the horrible "Who Moved My Cheese?" that attempts to manipulate grown adults by treating them like children. ---  --- Like the aforementioned "Who thinks my cheese stinks?" (or whatever it is called), I saw some people in the organisation where I work trying to sneakily weave it into the corporate culture and it lasted about five days. ---  --- It's all about making work "FUN". Yep, work can be "FUN". Tell that to the folks who work in hospital waste disposal. Or maybe those who deal with animal cruelty cases. ---  --- Of course, it's just great "FUN" to deal with children who have just had their parents killed, or folks who just lost their kids. ---  --- Because that's what work is - "FUN" - or so this book would have you believe you can convince your workers. ---  --- Of course in the examples I have listed above, it doesn't really work too well, because this is really about getting people in perceived lower-end occupations like factories or call-centres to believe their mind-numbing daily tasks can be "FUN". ---  --- Myself, I do have some "FUN" at work, but probably like many people with more than one brain cell, it is based on having a laugh with my co-workers about the sheer absurdity of where our work life often takes us. ---  --- You can call this cynicism, which is probably how it would be viewed by people who buy into this dumb "Fish"-style "WORK MUST BE FUN" philosophy. I'd call it black humour, but it keeps people sane and makes difficult work more bearable. ---  --- As to the title of my review - this method of making the workplace "FUN" in a forced way is very useful if you have employees that you wish to isolate and marginalise. ---  --- First immerse people in the cult-like atmosphere and tell them that they are now to regard work as "FUN". ---  --- Second, let them know that they now "CHOOSE" their attitude - if they are unhappy in any way (regardless of them doing their work well or not), they are "LETTING THE TEAM DOWN" and not complying with the obligation to "MAKE WORK FUN". ---  --- Third, while the majority of victims or workers, however you choose to view your prey, swallow the "WORK IS FUN" message and display the behaviour of sea lions clapping to get a mouthful of FISH, you can point to those who have shown a small streak of individual identity and are not HAVING FUN AT WORK and use the Enron-style message that they "just don't get it". ---  --- In this way, the resistant individual can be said to be "incompatible with our mission and values", "bad for morale" or just "out of step". ---  --- In this way, the "FUN-LOVING" workers, who have now taken on the costume of "FORCED FALSE FUN" can be set against them. ---  --- Of course this will compound their unhappiness and isolate them further until they are totally marginalised and can be tossed on the scrapheap or forced to resign. ---  --- This book is useful then, if you wish to convince idiots that their "WORK IS FUN". ---  --- Just don't try it on a group of people with a brain between them who might take their work seriously. ---  --- They might tell you to stick your "FISH" where the sun doesn't shine	neg
This is part 2 of a set titled SAY IT RIGHT. The CD has a blue and white style vs. the part 1 that has a yellow and white style on disc and cover. Also in a slim-line jewel case with the title track, non-album track, but an added dance remix plus video. If you enjoyed the first 2-track CD then this is a must. Dance lovers will definitely find this to be a totally spectacular production. ---  --- SAY IT RIGHT [Radio Edit] has the catchy dance beats, nice vocals, excellent drums, and chorus. The lyrics are fun to sing along and strong in meaning. Apparently, it's about not giving a lover power to control, destroy, or make you loose sleep. The melody has great rhythm, chorus, dance styles, and energetic beats. "You don't mean nothing at all to me" is repeated showing a strong message that life doesn't end with someone who isn't right.  ---  --- WHAT I WANTED brings Nelly to a slower tempo displaying depth of emotion. It's a slow ballad with true sincerity and humility. It's about going for something you wanted but never got. The outcome doesn't matter because the reality is you gave it your all. As she sings about her dream and what she wanted it's apparent love can be hard to let go yet comforting to do so. The melody is soothing, pleasant in sound, and refreshing for the soul.  ---  --- SAY IT RIGHT [Peter Rauhofer Remix Part 1] is a hot club remix sure to get you dancing off your feet. The song takes a dive to faster paced trance like effects, different introduction, pumping jamming dance styles with techno flairs, up and down tempos as well as plenty of percussion and synthesizers. Straying from the original song the vocals are still vastly heard yet filled with echoes, swirls of sounds, and much club ambiance. It's dreamy, fantasy filled, and definitely highly paced for the dance floor. If anything is certain it is this: The Remix in this CD is much better than many of her past singles. There is true DJ styles incorporation more instrumentations, effects, and vast production much more geared to club hoppers and dance fans. Quite sticky, infectious, and groove like this remix will get you dancing up a storm feeling like wanting to shake your body non-stop. Club lovers don't pass this out. Nelly's vocals are echoed often and electronic-a effects are vastly hard.  ---  --- SAY IT RIGHT VIDEO [Enhanced CD] is the video many have already seen as Timbaland and Nelly dance face to face and get very close as the message behind the music is reinforced. This is an excellent video with much dance styles, highly energetic beats, and flairs for control and getting the message across. ---  --- Overall, from all of Nelly's singles I find this to be on the top of my favorite. The combination of 2 highly emotional yet different songs plus a dance track and video makes this remarkable. Definitely buy this if you are a Nelly fan, club hopper, or a lover of music to enjoy for the depth of emotion, different styles displayed, and the themes. It's definitely a top sensation. Before it sells out be sure to buy it. The part 1 is also an excellent addition for those days you don't want to listen to the remix. This is highly recommended for sure!	pos

This is the best business and money magazine out there. They cover everything thought you needed to know and everything you didn't think of.	pos
Ah, the men's magazine. So many out there, where to draw the line when it comes to subscribing? Ultimately it boils down to what is worth the money you are shelling out, and for me, FHM is a cut above the rest for the following reasons. ---  --- 1. Articles are more intelligently written, less sophmoric, and delve on a wider array of issues. ---  --- 2. Paper quality is high glossy and sturdy, while other magazines feel like cheap pieces of newspaper by comparison. Paper feels like the same paper used by Playboy. ---  --- 3. Quality of women featured. FHM has by far a higher quality of women. Maxim tends to pull from a rung lower on the quality ladder, while FHM features beautiful, sexy, intelligent, and funny women whose interviews are actually readable. ---  --- 4. FHM Top 100 Women Special. Wow. Worth the money right there. ---  --- [...] --- Only negative with subscriptions is that these companies will send you last month's issue and count that as one of your 12 issues. That is annoying	pos

I really wanted to give Superman Volume 3 a full 5 stars, but unfortunately the quality control of the DVD release is poor, hence the 1 star rating.  The DVD set I purchased skipped at the Green Lantern episode.  The replacement I got also skipped at the same place.  In addition, the two-sided disc format with which all three DVD volumes have been released is a damage prone format.  Luckily I was able to get a full refund, but at this point I'm not sure if or when I'll try my chance at buying this set again.   ---  --- The lack of quality control is too bad, because Volume 3 contains some of the best episodes of the whole series.  If you are fortunate enough to get a DVD set free of defects, then you are really in for a treat.  Bruce Timm and company bring the same high level of storytelling to Superman as they did on Batman: The Animated Series.  Of particular note is an ongoing subplot involving the villain Darkseid throughout the series.  It finally gets put front and center in several episodes of Volume 3, and leads straight to the very powerful and dramatic series finale.  I felt that the finale could have been written out across three episodes instead of two due to the scale of the story, but nevertheless it is a great ending for a great series	neg
I found Cat Fancy Magazine to be mostly advertisements and breeders advertisements than real meat of information for cat owners.  I'm also very unimpressed with their Cat Channel online board they advertise in Cat Fancy and cannot recommend it to others.  They seem to have poor management of their online board especially on weekends so inappropriate posts stay there for a long time and a professional magazine advertising their own online board in their magazine should have their online board perfected before offering it.  Also Cat Fancy pushes a ridiculous high renewal rate for their magazine, but if you go onto Amazon, you can get a renewal rate of almost half the Cat Fancy renewal price.  So I have come to the conclusion that between the Cat Fancy magazine, their poor online Cat Channel board and the high renewal rate Cat Fancy charges, they are not interested in keeping their readers or online members. 	neg
This book is as close to perfect as you can get. I personally like magical realism and also wanted to learn more about the recent history of India. ---  --- Worth noting, the Mistry book, A Fine Balance, while good, is basically a full on rip off of this book.

It's a bad idea to create a character-driven sci-fi when your characters are this annoying.  The majority of Children of the Mind consists of inane dialogue between characters that are impossible to care about.  The characters are so one-dimensional and predictable that you already know what they'll say before they say it.  Peter says nothing except smart alecky remarks, Val spends the whole book whining loudly about not being a real person, Novinha is as crazy and hard-headed as she's been for the last two books, and Ender spouts off a bunch of trite, up-with-people garbage every chance he gets.  Somehow, Card even managed to make Jane more irritating than my ex-girlfriend during PMS.  The only decent characters in this book are Miro and Wang Mu, and they aren't nearly enough to save the story. ---  --- I admit it: I only made it a little over half-way through Children of the Mind.  I couldn't take the dialogue anymore.  That's not to mention the ridiculous plot, which centers on two children warping around the universe, engaging in philosophical discussions with caricatures of Japanese and Polynesian culture, in an attempt to avert a war between species. ---  --- If you're that curious to learn how the Ender Quartet concludes, do what I should've done from the beginning: find a plot synopsis somewhere and save yourself the pain of reading this garbage	neg
Reinventing the Bazaar used real-life examples to make markets understandable to any reader.  From pharmaceutical companies to the Tokyo fish market, McMillan brings markets alive right in front of the readers' eyes.  He attempts to demystify the mystery behind markets, and in my opinion, he succeeds.  Each chapter presents a new market setting which McMillan uses to illustrate his various points.  While the book has an economic undertone, the level of writing is not above the understanding of even a high school student.  All terminology is explained not only with words, but with examples, as well.  The book was enjoyable, especially if you have little familiarity with various market settings.  However, I would encourage anyone to read this book because even the experts on markets will have their knowledge enriched by this book	pos

I just saw this move for the first time in wide screen and it is a much different experience I must say. I think I have figured it out. In some other reviews I think Batricia Birch should have just stayed with the songs and the numbers. I think they should have got another director to get the rest of the movie off the ground. It is somewhat of a good story. I can see why it would be reversed (a guy trying to get the girl, instead of the other way around). You see Eugine in the beginning of the movie stumbling out of the bus. Well if he were a senior in the first one then why is he in the second one???? Also Frenchie is not with the Pink Ladies at all. You see her by herself or just briefly with the other pink ladies in school. I think the chemistry between Stephanie and Michael were worked well together. The songs were written by the same people that wrote the songs for the first movie. So really the bottom line is that they should have gotten a different director altogether. I know I know it is not the first one. But sequels are usually not, but they usually have connections to the first. Grease 2 tried to accomplish with Frenchie and the Tbirds, Pink ladies and all. I am glad they were able to have Eve Arden, Sid Ceaser, plus other great actors of the 50s and 60s like Tab Hunter. Is this movie cheesy???? Yes  --- Is it done in less than expected direction???? Yes. Does it have good songs??  Yes (Cool Rider, Reproduction, We'll Always be Together, Girl for all Seasons/Turn Back, and Back to School). The song skits themselves are good and with the same flavor of the first one. After all Kiddies, Patricia Birch did do the choreography for both.  --- So, in closing, this movie made it to my DVD collection if for that reason alone. If Grease 2 is going to stink then let it reek. If it has its moments of good cute fun then let it have that. I think if you loved the first Grease then I think you should at least give this one a try.     	pos
I have had it since October and it is clearly the best phone I have ever owned.  It has also replaced my camera, and I am now never without a camera. ---  --- I attend a lot of concerts where cameras are almost always prohibited.  They don't give the phone a second glance, not realizing it's got the 3.2 megapixel capability.  I have got tons of fantastic shots from the last 4 shows. ---  --- After throwing in a 1GB memory stick (I think it was $79?) it is now storing a half gig of my best music and the display says it will hold 300+ pics right now. ---  --- The movie function rocks too, however you are going to want to be up very close to the subject.  The sound playback of the movies is fantastic though, so at least concert videos make for good listening. ---  --- The phone works flawlessly with my PC.  If I throw it on the USB cable, it pops up instantly as another drive, just like the camera.  Just drag on/off the music and pics.  All pics are very nicely numbered and named. ---  --- If I don't care about viewing the files and just want to move stuff on and off the phone, I don't even take it out of my pocket.  The bluetooth connection allows me to use their software to move things around. ---  --- Also very cool was that it pops up on my computer as a Modem, which I actually was able to use immediately in my PC Anywhere program. ---  --- In terms of being a phone, yeah it's great.  The contact list is easy to work with, the call clarity is no issue at all, good signal, no dropped calls, etc. etc. (this is all with Cingular).  Speaker phone works well. ---  --- It needs charging about every 3rd day, charges very quickly.  Charges slower but with the USB plugged in it also charges.   ---  --- The only thing I can think to complain about is that when using the USB cable to charge, it only wants to charge it to 89%.  If I want 100% I have to throw it on the real charger for a few minutes. --- 	pos
If you are planning on getting a good deck then do not waste your time with this..it has the essentials, sure, but your money is better spent at one of the 4 "STRUCTURE DECKS"!! They are much better than this..I can say so beacuse my sis owns this deck and I can beat her every time :) Konami needs to put some better stuff in this deck - like Senju of the Thousand Hands X 2. Also they need to take away the change of heart since it's "advanced" forbidden. but still, this deck deserves an OK rating since it has all the essentials..this is no better than the first yugi starter deck. So if you ALREADY have a starter deck, do not get this as it is not worth it - a lot of weak non effect monsters.	neg

Don't get me wrong...the concept of this toy if fantastic...and when it works it is wonderful....however, it sucks up so many batteries it is not even funny! It requres 4 C batteries and we replace them at LEAST every 3 weeks! Not only that but there is something wrong with the toy that makes it stick in the "on" position even after you turn it off (very loud and sqeaky". V-Tech knows of this problem but tell you when you call to "take the batteries our and turn it off and on 20 times to reset it". Well, that will work a few times but then the toy is totally broken. AND...their idea is for you to send it to them and they will take 2 weesk to send you a replacement....hmm....is this not a toy marketed to help children sleep...so we OBVIOUSLY need it at bedtime! I offered to apy them up front for a new one and they could reimburse me but they would not bend. Needless to say I am QUITE frustrated with V-tech!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If they know it is a problem they should tell you that on the FIRST call so something can be done about it!!! --- Another creepy side note....the thing says "I love you" in some strange voice to your child......SCARY! --- V-Tech has a great idea here and it is the best toy of its type...however, it doesn't work....looks like they came out with the technology a bit too soon! --- BTW...I rated Durability as a 1 and Amazon has it showing as 3 stars...hmmmm!	neg

I'm the first to confess that I had never heard any of any of the actors starring in the 1951 Robert Wise gothic noir, The House on Telegraph Hill, but it doesn't matter, because all the actors are good, and combined with an extremely effective plot, the movie is a terrific tale of murder, deceit and assumed identities in post world war San Francisco.  ---  --- As was the fashion with many noir films of the time, The House on Telegraph Hill is told in flashback with a voice over from the heroine. She tells of her house that is empty and is up for sale, and one immediately assumes that something terrible has happened. However, the narrative soon jumps to Germany at the end of the War, and we meet Victoria Kopwelska (Valentina Cortese) is a Polish woman imprisoned in Belsen. ---  --- With her husband and family dead, Victoria tells the kindly American commander Major Marc Bennett (William Lundigan) that there's nothing for her back in Poland. Desperate to survive, Victoria learns that her best friend has family in the United States, and if they are ever freed, she promises to take Victoria to America with her. Her friend however, is killed shortly before American troops can liberate the camp.  ---  --- With nowhere to go, Victoria hatches a scheme to steal her friend's papers and sail to America, where she learns now the godmother to a young boy Chris (Gordon Gebert), as well as the heir to a sizable fortune, and a gorgeously gothic house high atop Telegraph Hill, following the death of her "aunt." Ensconced in the ostensible mansion, Victoria, now dressing in glamorous frocks and drinking expensive champagne marries the boy's guardian Alan Spender (Richard Basehart), partly out of desperation and partly out of the need for security. ---  --- As Victoria becomes a "mother" to the boy, she clashes with his governess Margaret (Fay Baker) and coincidently reconnects with Marc whom she met a Belsen, now a studly a playboy type lawyer.  All the adults are not as they seem: Marc has been making secret plans to get his hands on the money, and Victoria's arrival causes him to draft a new scheme.  Victoria begins to believe that her new sweetheart is up to no good. And then there's the Margaret, the furtive outsider and whether her allegiances to Chris are all they seem.  ---  --- The film is compelling, and tension-fuelled and beautifully shot in black and white. Cortese is especially good in one of her first American roles and as Victoria, she frantically tries to keep up her masquerade, yet through no fault of her own, she steadily becomes a victim of Alan's scheming.  ---  --- Of particular note are the stunning location shots of San Francisco. The main house is just beautiful and the scenes when Victoria is playing baseball with Chris offer stunning views of San Francisco Bay. The House on Telegraph Hill ultimately serves as one of the better noir thrillers - there's a runaway car, poisoned orange juice, an enigmatic and jealous housekeeper and a false identity. It all makes for a gripping and entertaining film.  ---  --- Victoria starts out as a victim, and although she schemes and lies her way into the house on Telegraph Hill, her ability to rise above the nefarious misdeeds enable her to achieve a kind of redemption for both her and Chris.

I found two paperbacks at work, which were both thriller series, both written by women, both having two word titles with the first word being "Blind."  One of the two I found exciting and satisfying, and eagerly read it.  That was not this book. ---  --- At first, I thought it was just me.  Unlike others, I found it easy to get into the book.  But I found it too new age for me.  Between Eve talking to her dead daughter to the creepy Aldo to Jane's connection with the murdered Cira, I decided I didn't need to read the whole novel and checked to make sure Jane and Trevor survived.   ---  --- Maybe this wasn't Iris Johansen's best book.

As a classic Seattle tea, this tea brings back memories of hiding away from the rainy weather sipping a delicious naturally sweet cinnamon citrus tea. When I drink this tea, I am home again.

You can sweeten this more if you like with Stevia or a natural sugar to enhance the natural sweetness. It is good with a touch of Muscovado Sugar from India Tree or the RIEME French vanilla syrup. ---  --- When I'm writing reviews and I get sleepy, this tea --- wakes me up.   ---  --- ~The Rebecca Review	pos

This was my second Netgear product I bought (previously a wireless modem which I was only okay with not impressed)  The idea of a network storage appeals to me.  But this drive just is not good.   ---   --- In reading the previous reviews I found that it was a finicky thing, and be careful on the drives you buy for it.  Well I searched and searched and found a drive that worked and bought both yesterday.  ---   --- Tried to set it up today and connecting the drive went pretty well, but that is where everything started to go down hill.  Midway through the install it tells you to okay any error messages (which turn out to be things like this is untested on XP and might not work kind of errors) and suddenly my computer reboots.  Figured it would have told me it was going to do so oh well, and it never goes back to the install like most programs do when they require a reboot.  Tried again, same thing happens.  Started poking around and find out that not only do you have to check the drive you put in to the SC101, you need to look in to your own computer.  To quote Netgears web site, "SCSI disk drivers from the Promise company conflict with the SC101 device drivers. Promise drivers are typically used for RAID 1 or for SATA drives. Many newer computers use Promise SATA drivers." ---  --- My computer is just a week old and has these newer drivers.  Back in the box the SC101 goes, and I try to uninstall the software as this product will not work for me.  Tried the 3 things when you have trouble it suggests, and none work.  This is where I get really frustrated, Netgear support.  I waited 35 minutes for someone to pick up the phone, who ultimately told me it was my own fault and I'd have to pay to have that "cr*p", yes he said it, from my system.  I needed to hire a local computer vendor and it would be my bill.  I have to pay to get this junk off my computer.  Way to support your products Netgear.  The tech support person who got on the phone had an accent that was hard to understand, and went through huge mood swings during the call, from happy, to argumentative, to depressed, to happy again.  I was freaked that this person knew my home address! ---   --- All in all, this is a great concept.  After reading up on it and now experiencing it, I think it needs a ton more engineering and refinement before it is brought to market.  Maybe by a company with better customer service.

I have tried so many products out there to firm up the area under my eyes and nothing has worked.  Initially I was a little skeptical cause of my lack of success with other products.  I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised.  It certainly has improved the look of the skin around my eyes.  It may seem  expensive, but a little goes a very very long way.  Has a nice texture and easily absorbs and not the least big irritating...and I have sensitive skin.  Try it...I don't think you'll be disappointed.  I wasn't	pos
I am so sick of all the fragrances out there that smell like chocolate, pie or cake. Why people want to smell like food puzzles me. That's why I was so glad to find a feminine floral scent with a little tease to it. Maybe Baby is delightful, not too heavy but making its presence known. The complements will flow. It's sweet (not too sweet though) and innocent while at the same time being flirty. If I had to pick a season it reminds me of it would be Spring. I can't describe a frangrance anymore than I can describe a wine but with all the stinkers out there I just had to put in a good word for this very wearable scent.	pos
Battery is way overpriced. Contact Battery Store near you! I did and found this same exact battery type(2-6volt Batteries) for much less. While there they told me I could use a low amp 12v Deep Cycle battery instead. It did take some time wiring (FUSED LINK IS A MUST) but is well worth it. Lasts all day and you can charge it at a 2 amp "trickle charge" with a "amp selectable" car battery charger. All told it cost me less than $60 for everything. It now longer just "Takes Up Space"	neg

We purchased this carrier for our sons car seat 4 years ago.  For perspective, we are heavy travelers with 4-6 international trips/year and always bring our son's car seat along. This carrier has been indispensable for us. It fits our large Britax Roundabout, plus has space for a bag of diapers, soft toys or the extra shopping from our trips.  We use the back pack or wheels to tote it around airports or onto planes. As our son grew large enought to not need the seat on the plane, we simply check it through as a piece of luggage.  The material is lightweight and we have had a few small tears along the bottom of the bag, but we were able to repair them easily enough by ourselves with needle and thread. We just adopted a second child and bought the same carrier again for her car seat as well	pos
Many words - few practical tips! This book did not give much more (-valuable-) information than I already had found out by reading the manual delivered with my pocket computer.  --- After reading the book I still had to search for web communities, where some of my questions could be answered.  --- My expectations when buying the book were mainly focused on the need for practical hints concerning how to manage tasks, contacts and appointments. Unfortunately, in my view, these important and basic issues were treated too superficially.    	neg
I bought this cd after hearing Tony on one of the am morning shows, and really likings some of his past offerings, but I have to say that this cd was the pits and a waste of my money.  I was ticked off to have bought this cd from a talented brother and not have gotten my money's worth.  Tony has been on the scene for quite a number of years, and I expected a more mature offering from him than this latest.  There is a great lack of maturity on this cd, and it's an overall disappointment.  Unfortunately, I have to say here that Toney is not alone.  What on earth possessed veteran soul singers the O'Jays to sing a song like Let's Ride?  Who are they singing about girls their granddaughters ages?  Hoochie mommas?  What?  Babyface?  Even he gets in on the foolishness of trying to sing like the hip hop crowd!  And what's up with the explicit lyrics?  We all know you can curse like sailors, but why is this language necessary in music?  And I know that artist have always performed their music, but will someone tell me why it's necessary to perform with so few clothes on?  I would rather hear your music, not see your booty! Sorry, but a review I just read triggered me, and I'd been thinking about the Tony Terry cd for a while.  Hope he comes up with a more mature offering the next time.  Meanwhile I think you're safe in skipping this particular cd	neg
This was the only gate on the market that I could find that would fit the 12 foot doorway between my livingroom and dining area. It stated easy to install but when the screws kept breaking off inside my new woodwork and I kept having to redrill holes I was a bit angry!!!! I suggest predrilling your holes!!! The hinges  also won't stay on and the swinging gate doesn't line up. You need 2 hands to close the gate which as a busy mom of 5 children you don't always have 2 hands free!

I bought the Tourmaline hoping to save time, because I have very thick, wavy hair that takes 45 minutes to dry and straighten.  It ended up taking just as long, but the results were much better.  My hair was super straight and shiny, and it didn't get frizzy even in humid weather.  Then when I was using it for just the 4th time, it completely stopped working.  Just as other people described, the red light shut off and it cooled down, and never turned back on.  I'm in the process of trying to get a refund or replacement now. 	neg
For a recently college graduate and moderate sports world observer with little experience negotiating in a business environment, this book was a pleasure to read. The concepts in this book are on or above par with my textbook on negotiation. However, I specifically enjoyed how Steinberg illustrates important concepts with stories involving the ever interesting personalities of professional sports. From establishing values to finalizing the contract, this book is efficiently organized to lead through the negotiation process. Also, at the end of each sub-chapter is a summary of the key points of the reading. Winning with integrity isn't easy in general, let alone in the ruthless world of sports agents. Leigh shares his experiences that have lead to his success in this fun and insightful book	pos
I just got mine from Amazon (after a lengthly delay).  It is an awesome memory card.  It comes with the adapter so that you can use it in digital cameras.  I tested it on the camera and it worked great.  The real test was the compatibility with the SONY PSP.  No issues there.   The card worked flawlessly.  I've already used up 600 MB.....its a must buy! ---  --- Plus, at $99.99, its much less than other retailers.   btw, i ordered it at $104.99, then contacted amazon about the price drop.  They credited the difference to me without any hassle and gave me the one-day shipping at no charge because of the delay.  Overall great service too.	pos

I bought this item because of a great price, Amazon shipped it regualr UPS and I received it earlier that expected, the box looked in good shape but when I opened it one of the legs was broken off,I thought at first that it must have taken a pretty good hit to do that, so I called customer service and they sent me a return tag and shipped me a new one right out, I got it, opened it and the exact same thing, box was in good shape but 1 leg was broken, I called customer service and again they shipped another one out, this time second day air. I get the third one and guess what, the exact same thing for the third time! I looked at it carefully and each time it was broken at the weld in two areas on the cooker and it had to have been poor workmanship and quality control, it even looked like it had rusted in one weld! I can't say enough about Amazon's customer service,but I wouldn't reccommend buying the banjo cooker by mail order	neg

 I thought that this would be an ideal product for my aging father as both his sight and his dexterity are somewhat impaired. My first thought was to contact the parent company, Hy-Tek Manufacturing, to ask for a dealer referral and to get some answers to a few simple operations questions. After 3 days they did get back to me, recommending Amazon as a purchase source but ignoring my request for operations information. I sent a second email but it was completely ignored. Maybe this should have been a warning. ---  ---  I decided to go ahead and order one anyway. The purchasing process was quick and easy and delivery form Amazon's agent was about 5 days, more than acceptable. The unit comes well packaged with easy to follow instructions. Actual programming is simple and very straight forward. The problems started after successfully programming my dad's satellite receiver. The main menu could not be accessed, the information button was non-functional and two of the numeric keys did not work. I tried all of the codes listed for the manufacturer of that receiver, none of them made any difference. ---  ---  Another email to Hy-Tek, and another 3 day wait, produced the response " it doesn't work with all devices and I guess it just won't work with your receiver, you'll have to send it back to the supplier. We will make note of this and maybe we can add this receiver in a future update. " No help at all and no concern or consideration expressed on the part of the manufacturer. If they had bothered to respond to my original inquiry in the first place, I would never have purchased this substandard piece of equipment and wouldn't have been out the freight charges. One of the questions that I asked originally was " will it access the main menu? ", but they didn't have the common courtesy to respond. ---  ---  Be aware that this remote will not work with all devices. Even simple, necessary functions like menu and numbers may not be accessible. The manufacturer is slow to respond to customer inquiries and less than helpful if and when they do. Would I recommend or purchase this item again, absolutely not	neg

This toy is a piece of junk. I can't believe Disney actually did any testing whatsoever on this toy. An adult can't even get it to work. The car is supposed to sense the infrared light in front of it and follow, but all it does is jerk forward a teeny bit and then stop. If anything, it senses when the light clicks off and then it jerks forward a little bit. We read the instructions and saw that the car does not work well in bright lighting conditions so we took it down to the dark basement (as if my son should actually be expected to only play with this car in the dark!) but it didn't even work there.  BIG DISAPPOINTMENT on Christmas morning that we had to wait 8 hours for it charge, and then even BIGGER disappointment the next morning when we finally got to play with it and it didn't work.

This is my 2nd one.

Overall, not terribly happy with this units user interface and design.

After purchasing this product, I found there were several problems with scanning. I contacted Nuance (who purchased ScanSoft) to ask for assistance from Technical Support.

After putting out a great deal of money for this product, I should not have to pay $9.95 for assistance with each issue that is a problem with their product. Save yourself a great deal of grief and avoid this product. I regret that Amazon does not allow me to give this product "0" stars.	neg
It's fascinating to compare my own experiences, having lived now 3 years in Germany, to those of an American from 125 years earlier.  I've been learning to speak German, and his Appendix on the "awful" German language was hilarious.  In poking fun at German grammar (e.g., long sentences), he purposely commits the same errors in his own writing.  The scene "riding" the glacier down the Alps was so funny I had tears running down my face.  It's amazing to think that it was written in 1879, when America was barely a century old, and the insights and perceptions then can be incredibly, eerily similar to either my or "typical" American's attitudes today. ---  --- I'd recommend it to anyone, but particularly to anyone visiting or living in Europe.  It's way funnier than his "Innocents Abroad", which is also a good read on travel in Europe	pos
My son received a Bumbo seat for Christmas.  At five months of age, he rolled out of it and was laying on top of the seat.  At six months of age, he turned in the seat and fell on to his HEAD on two different occassions.  The seat was on a flat surface.  He did this and I was standing or sitting right next to him. --- I loved this seat when he first got it.  I told everyone I knew about it. He has two older siblings and he  loved to be able to watch them play.  His siblings loved him sitting in the seat because he was at their level.   ---  Now, I have absolutely NO confidence in the safety of this seat.  It is completely useless as his "own body weight" DOES NOT "keep baby in place" as advertised.  The seat has been rendered useless in my home because it is NOT safe and it is safer to put him in a traditional bouncy seat or on the floor.	neg

Filmed in 1933, this movie is in black and white, and might be considered dull and slow-moving by today's standards.  An accurate chronology of the six wives of Henry VIII, the characters of the wives are rather  undeveloped, and the movie does not delve very deeply into the important  religious and political questions around which the marriages centered.  A  good introduction for those who are unfamiliar with the basic story, but  the serious scholar will want to conduct further research	neg
For those of us brought up on Vegemite, Marmite doesn't make the grade.  For those brought up on Marmite, Vegemite seems a poor substitute.  For Americans who only seem to put sweet stuff on their cake (oops, I mean "bread") both are revolting. ---  --- I think that a major reason why Americans abhor these savoury spreads is that being used to spreading honey and jam on their breakfast toast, they tend to use like quantities of Vegemite or Marmite.  To uninitiated the taste of either spread applied so lavishly is going to be overwhelming.  Before passing judgment on these spreads, you would do well to heed the advice of "Joanna" or "mtspace" and apply thinly. It also works best with very fresh bread or hot toast. ---  --- Incidentally, I believe that Marmite was first.  Vegemite was an Australian imitation created several years later.  It was originally called Parwill - a pun which will be appreciated by Aussies and Brits but which may not be understood by Americans because of the way the words are pronounced. ---  --- I only give Marmite four stars.  That probably tells you my upbringing	pos
You'll need a large throw pillow for a back cushion - 20" at least. Also, the chair is fairly low. Seat cushion is okay, about the same quality as Target or Home Depot.

My husband and I recently went to Florida to see his mother in the hospital. She had suddenly become ill. As we waited for her prognosis, we went to several local grocery stores to try to locate Drake's Funny Bones which my husband considered a comfort food that his mother would always get for him when he would visit. We looked to no avail.   --- Unfortunately his mother passed away the next day. We headed home to Arizona and the first thing I did was try to find out how to get some of these snack cakes.

It is obvious that this movie is full of lies.  Although I have not actually seen it, I know this to be true because I have seen many discussions on the movie on the Fox news channel (God bless them!).  The way he attacks poor Mr. Heston is deplorable.  Can't Michael Moore tell from the comments Charlton made at the rallies that he doesn't have his faculties about him?  I am also unsure that Mr. Heston even said the things that the movie shows him saying.  The ability of Hollywood to manipulate and edit sound is truly amazing, making it appear that My President (Heston) is an uncaring, babbling idiot by simply using his own words - shame on you Michael!  And as for the way he got the gun from the bank, I agree with the other posters that the entire point of a bank giving away free guns is completely nullified by the fact that they didn't give him the gun the minute he walked into the bank.  Bravo to those who figured that out.  Also, Michael Moore is fat.  Take that Pinkie	neg
Now i dont usually write reviews for things, but when i do its because i really like it or i really hate it. And i must say this is one of the best, if not the best music magazine out there.

I first heard Dan singing background vocals on the Jackson Browne album "Late for the Sky".  I was 16.  I went out and bought this album (which I STILL have!!) even though I had never heard it.  I had the pleasure of seeing Dan open for the Eagles at the Spectrum in support of this album in Phila, in 1974; I was a junior in high school.  They all joined in on "Best of My Love" and it just blew mw away. He had this really interesting piece of cloth on his piano.  Few people had heard of him prior to this album. This is by far his BEST album.  It is more rock and roll than the rest of his sappy later work in the 80's and a true songwriting gem.  I can remember singing "Morning Sky" in my friend's Ford on the way to school. You have to listen to it over and over.. "Someone's Been Tellin' You Stories" had a sly sexual rhyme in it that was not played on radio at that time. The musicianship on this album only serve to enhance the quality of the songwriting.  This was the most raw of Dan's albums, and by ar, the most superior.  Sadly, Dan is now fighting advanced prostate cancer (check out his website).  Let's hope he will make a full recovery and record and tour again soon.  This is a must have for anyone who is a fan of any 1970's rock and roll. 	pos
I paid over $150 for this watch a couple of years ago, and I loved it when I first bought it (as do many of the other reviewers on this page). However, it took about 18 months for the band to break, and then less than 2 years for the watch to completely die. The solar charger slowly quit working - at first I just couldn't set the hands on the watch because it was stuck in "recover" mode, but the digital display was still correct so it was still somewhat usable. Then after a few months of this, everything went blank. I sent it off to Casio expecting a quick, inexpensive repair (or even a free repair, as I expected them to stand behind their product). Shortly thereafter, I received a repair estimate for $94.11 - more than the watch currently sells for brand new! So...in my opinion, the watch is probably worth the $69.00 that it currently sells for, but don't expect it to last more than a year or two. I won't be buying another Casio	neg
I bought this game on PS2 for my daughter who is 12, and she has had a ball playing it.

I have owned the WMR-968 for several years now and have spent more on 'replacement' parts than if I had bought an entire new unit.  Primarily, the solar transmitter on the rain gauge continually fails to bring the charge up to enough power for the transmitter to transmit back to the base.  I have replaced this transmitter unit three times (twice with the 'new' style).  Living in the Phoenix area, we don't run into too many cloudy or rainy days, but as soon as it doesn't get sunlight for any length of time, the display reads all dashes (not receiving a signal).  So when it rains here, I usually don't get a reading of how much because this thing stops working.  The anemometer is mounted on the same pole just above the rain gauge with the both of the solar transmitters also mounted on the same pole.  The anemometer works consistently and fine.  Both OS and the local distributor say the distance is too far, the unit must have gone bad and needs replacement, etc.,etc.  Replacing the solar unit didn't help and the distance can't be too far for one unit and not the other.  No one can help with this issue.  So my suggestion would be to spend the extra bucks and get something more reliable. 	neg

Teas vary greatly in quality and the price reflects that.  This is a moderately price matcha tea so don't except the best flavor.  It is nutritious so it may be better as a flavor additive to drinks, desserts, broth, etc.  Real matcha can also be bitter and an acquired taste.  Japanese often drink it with tiny sugar candies to offset the bitterness.  Matcha also contains a lot of antioxidants so it may be helpful to some to stat incorporating it into their diet.  If you don't like the taste an easy drink is to mix it with orange juice	pos
Just received one for my son's birthday. He loves it as he has a laptop like daddy. The quality is terrible, like another user's experience the right side of the device doesn't work properly and this is brand new. Apparently the sensors on the device don't line up properly with the go circles or volume icons on pages with them on the right side. I can't exchange it as I am not in the US so we can only play with half a book unless we experiment with finding where the right side sensors actually are. This of course is very frustrating to a 3 yr old as it really messes up alot of stuff. --- Also the type of pencil seems rally sharp and brittle for a 4 yr old.

I have been buying this stuff since the wholesale club had opened in my town seven years ago.  I was horrified this past Thanksgiving to find out they no longer carried it.  I tried to improvise with garlic powder and Italian seasoning, but my homemade ravioli were not nearly as good as they had been in the past.  I can't say enough great things about this stuff.  I use it to season burgers, steak, to spread over chicken with a little olive oil before baking and grilling and in all of my stuffed pasta dishes.  It's not just great, it's AMAZING!!	pos

cheap, cheap, cheap- I know you get what you pay for, but 20 bucks(after shipping) is a lot to pay for nothing in return.

Very disappointed. I bought this in hopes of relief from pain and pressure after I pulled a pelvic muscle at about 30 weeks pregnant. It has not helped me and has been annoying. The L-XL is too large but the S-M was too small. The material folds and rolls under my clothes and there's nowhere for the extra flap of material in front to go. I get sweaty underneath it and it's difficult to get my underwear back under it after using the bathroom---which I'm obviously doing frequently at 34 weeks! This was the only pregnancy belt available at the shop I went to. I wish I'd had the chance to try on others to compare	neg

What a great line of sauces the Scarpetta brand brings to the table.  I have tried all of them and the time saving of having these already in my kitchen is very helpful.

This is Hawking's attempt to write about complicated physics for those of us who did not do well in math and therefore did not take the advanced sciences requiring ability in math.  While still not an easy read, it it much easier than the BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME that he wrote for laypeople before this.  A person who wants to know what the current scientific thinking is about the nature of the universe will find it worth spending the time it takes to read and digest this book, as they will be reading about it from one of the leading scientists in this field.

                                            --- Lemony the game is not for hardcore gamers. It doesn't aspire to be.  It shouldn't be compared to Warcraft or Resident Evil 4. ---       --- The game was developed by AMAZE for Activision.  Any one familiar with the first three Harry Potter Movie co-ordinated games (through Electronic Arts EA Games) is familiar with Amaze.         ---             --- The first three Potter games were fun and a bit of challenge for children and for those adults who were new to PC gaming.  The player wandered around the magical world of Hogwarts, collecting jelly beans and wizard cards.  What was fun was not completeing the tasks or learning new magic, what was fun was the freedom to discover new areas and find secret places.   ---        --- Fans of the Potter games will recognize the same mechanics of gameplay outfitted  in  a new location, jelly beans are replaced with golden eyes, golden hearts refuel stamina instead of chocolate frogs, playbills and letters are granted instead of wizard cards.  Players will also recognize the flavor of  wonderful score the game is set to, enjoyable, appropiate, but not overbearing with some familiar notes.    ---          --- Lemony isn't quite as good as the aforementioned Potter games. The reason being Lemony is not a fun story. While ficticious, Lemony is a story of the relentless abuse of three very droll and very wealthy orphans.   Its much more fun to play as a boy, who has left his abusive Aunt and Uncle behind, entering a magical world to be educated at Hogwarts.  I rather enjoyed learning to how to fly Buckbeak in Prizoner of Azkaban. In Lemony, I'm rather relieved I solved the train signal puzzle, the thought of having children run over and over and over by a train until I did, was depressing me.    ---    --- Yet, Lemony will provide some consolation to those who have been disappointed by EA's latest Potter offering, The Goblet of Fire.  While there is an adjustment to the droll circumstances, the task of discovering your world will take over and the game will eventually command your attention.    ---     --- While Lemony isn't bad, it isn't that good, either.  They renderings of the children are not the most flattering they could be, and the villians are boorishly ugly.     ---    --- The gameplay controls aren't half as good as the Potter games, and they weren't the greatest.  There's a match game puzzle in a cellar, that only shows up per every install, instead of every game. I did complete it and nothing happened on my game, which maybe the reason the puzzle won't show up in the rest of the games in a particular installation.  It has done this twice on me, and I'm not going to uninstall and install a third time to see if it happens again. It had no effect on my score or letter or eye collecting.  The camera angles aren't well mapped for shooting.  I was supposed to shoot a rat, but the camera got behind a ceiling lamp, and while the rat was biting me, all I could see was the inside of a lamp shade. Suff like that.   ---      --- Still its better than most children's games out there, and it plays!  As you may have guessed, there is violence.  When I shoot  a rat in Lemony, it is shot with a rotten egg lobber. Rotten eggs are your bullets, and the player stuns the enemies, instead of killing them.  About time. ---    --- I've played Lemony three times, the third time it was going through the motions.  Once the few skills of jumping, aiming the egg lobber, and  the boot puncher had been mastered, there wasn't any interest left. But for the time I did play, I did enjoy it.     ---    --- The games by AMAZE are a category unto themselves. They are not action games based on a trigger finger, nor are they the point click boring adventure games beset with brain teaser puzzles in a futuristic world. They are a relaxing time where you don't have to test your brain, just delight it.   ---    --- If you have never played the Potter games and are new to PC gaming I recommend Lemony, it is a good place to start.  If you are a fellow Potterhead and felt betrayed buy Goblet of Fire, Lemony will sustain you.	pos

This was the first brand of nursing pads I tried.  My first few weeks of nursing were very painful and these pads were a bit scratchy.

The only good thing I can say is the print quality is fine and the wireless network works.  But...software installation is long and tedious (and took three times on one laptop to get to work). Installed drivers cause my PC to take 45+ seconds longer to boot and sometimes (about 30%) stop the shut-down sequence (I have to click "end" in a dialogue box).  The ink runs out (even the big black one) amazingly quickly and replacements are $54 at Costco.  It seems you gotta get ONLY HP cartridges, as third-party cartridges fail.  I'll never buy another HP printer	neg
Save yourself time and buy any book by Greg LeMond (Greg Lemond's Complete Book of Bicycling) or John Howard (John Howard's The Cyclist's Companion) -- they are both far better writers, well-rounded bicyclists, and honorable family men -- good role models for all true cycling athletes, young and old alike.  Lance Armstrong is good at chronicling his many bicycling events and achievements in this book, but what is notably missing from this text is the experience of a genuine champion.  Lance Armstrong would sell his own grandmother's last pair of socks in order to succeed -- leaving his family behind in order to pursue his one-dimensional goal of winning the Tour de France.  He sold his wife and three helpless kids for bicycling success and he degrades the sport and his wonderful family by publicly flaunting his association with a pathetic and desperate rock singer ... yawn.  Better to settle down with Greg LeMond's wonderful book for real depth, excitement, and rich experience and learn how to become a well-rounded cyclist and a real champion cycling athlete and family champion as well	neg

This is a kick piano, not a hand piano and as such it needs to be mounted in a baby's crib.  We thought it would be useable if we just held the piano in place for our daughter to kick, or for her to use her hands on the keys - it isn't.  As we use her crib for sleeping, not playing, this has been a total waste of money.   --- At 10 months my daughter is now able to sit and press the keys on the piano with her hands, but the response of the keys isn't instant and the noise is so soft that she doesn't recognise that she's making it work.

To me, this game was seriously disappointing. So disappointing, I didn't finish the second case before setting it down forever.  ---  --- I was highly entertained - at first. It's cute, funny, and going around clicking on things for a new DS user was highly entertaining. However, it quickly got older.  ---  --- 1. You can't skip through the horrendously long dialog - ever. Even after you've heard it about a million times because you're clicking on people hopelessly in frustration unable to figure out what to do. ---  --- 2. I found myself looking for an internet walk through, yes, on this simplistic game. I couldn't figure out what to click and wandering around hopelessly for thirty minutes reading over dialog you've read a thousand times just gets too frustrating even for my typical patience level. ---  --- 3. Possible Spolier - There seemed to be a glich in the second story in which I talked to the wrong person at the wrong time and then I could never get a ticket into the planetarium. After that, I just couldn't take it any more and gave up. ---  --- 4. The places and people never change. For each case, from my understanding, it's all the exact same tiny few places. I'm not a big gamer, but I like a world bigger than three feet.  ---  --- I let a friend borrow it and thus far she is enjoying it more than me.  ---  --- Just to help this review - I'm a college-age female and this is my first gaming console, although I've played the PS2 quite a bit. Maybe it's really a hit or miss but I don't really recommend it for anyone but someone with a high patience level. A REALLY high patience level	neg
Damn. There's nothing remarkable about the second item on this DVD; it's your standard European-made sexploitation film. "The Wild, Wild World of Jayne Mansfield," on the other hand, is reprehensible. It's a hodge-podge of vacation footage of Mansfield, clips from her movie project, and material entirely unrelated to Mansfield, linked only by the voiceover... and then, after an hour or so of light-hearted softcore buffoonery, the movie cuts to her death, spending the last twenty minutes obsessing on her husband and children and the large, mostly empty mansion she has left behind. ---  --- This movie has the feel of something slapped together for the sole purpose of trading off a famous name after Mansfield's death. This is exploitation in its worst form. I found the sudden change in tone, the large volume of non-Mansfield material, and the sheer obsessiveness of the last twenty minutes disgusting in the extreme. Those looking for cheesy bad movies to enjoy, or softcore porn to tittilate, go elsewhere; this one is not merely bad, but evil	neg

Avent makes the best washable baby bottles around, so we felt that their sippy cups would be just as good. Well we were wrong. Of the five cups we had, all of them leaked and have since been thrown out. The cups are five different pieces vs other brands that use three  pieces, which makes them harder to wash, harder to put together, and more pieces to lose.

I would not reccomend this product. It was cheaper at Amazon.com than walmart, but It took forever to get. It took two weeks for us to get it. When caption said ships 5-7 days. Than when we did get it, several pieces were broken. Major pieces. When I called the company, (which I was on hold for 30 minutes) then told me that we had so many pieces that were broken (5) that we needed to return it. I told them no, it's over 100 lbs and I am 7mth preg. they then changed the tune and said they would ship the parts they would be here in 4 weeks. Another mth. So  it took almost 2 mths to get this product. It is not worth the problems. Plus, nothing was labeled, and you had to figure out what pieces were what. Plus, the shelves inside the unit are WHITE, the armoire is natural but the shelves inside are white. I called the company and they said this is true.	neg

A friend of mine gave me this cd about a year ago, I listened to a few minutes of it and was like "What is this crap?" and I shelved it for a couple months.

Early on in the game you use a pistol and rifle and take down some stormtroopers for the New Republic as you explore their base, with no force powers. But events make a turn for the worse and you go to Luke and request for your lightsaber back. Then you begin to discover force powers as you search out the dark Jedi/killer of your girlfriend for the rest of the game. With amazing graphics and increddible duels, this game is simply magnificent. Plus the multiplayer is awesome (especially when you play CTF and give the other team a boat load of Storm Troopers you and your friend being rebels with one bot helping you against twenty or so Stormtroopers makes the game a game you'll never want to trade in! Plus the duels are fun to play again and again. I would have five stars but the game does have two or three puzzles that are quite difficult.  All in all a great game that any StarWars fan must own, any shooter fan really has to have, and if you like both, oooh you need it really bad	pos

I have to be pretty honest - I was excited to get this kit, but so far I've been disappointed.  Maybe I'm not getting the whole technique down, but I find the diagrams pretty generalized and the powder flakes everywhere it isn't supposed to (like under my eyes, making them look very raccoon-y and tired--and when wearing smoky eyes, I figure you probably want everything else to look pretty bright in comparison to the dramatic eye effect).  Maybe I can't pull of the look or maybe I'm not applying it correctly, but either way, it always ends up looking like a big, dark, glittery mess...I'm a big Bare Escentuals lover, but I was disappointed with this product. 	neg
I was very pleased when this toy finally arrived.  The Blue Devil is removable and semi-posable (his arms move).  He is the same size as the Simpson figures from the Playmates line of toys, so I feel like he was made with collectors of those figures in mind.

If you're not, buy something more expensive perhaps... ---  --- Pros: --- - It does protect the screen and click wheel nicely. --- - The flip-up top magnetically shuts and holds securely, which I guess helps if you happen to drop it. ---  --- Cons: --- - The belt clip is ridiculous. It's not a stationary clip. Instead it spins around, which makes the likelihood of it falling off your hip greater. This product is not for the joggers. --- - The leather strap that comes with it is too short, which makes it difficult to operate the iPod when it's around your neck. --- - It seems that the magnets leave marks on the areas not mentioned under Pros above. But, as long as you never take your iPod out of the case, no worries. --- - This is made for the 30 GB iPod Video, but it's actually a little big for it. It leaves room for the iPod to slide up and down in the case. It makes accessing the HOLD switch difficult sometimes when the flip-up top is down. It's easier to just open the top. ---  --- If you don't care about the cons and you are cheap like me, go ahead and buy it	neg
The watch looks great; prominent, yet not overly large.  The orange really sets off the look.  The large luminescent indexes are easy to see long after dark.  I also like having both day and date complications, and to find an automatic watch with these features for less than $300 (way less on Amazon) is really a find.  You will need a pro to adjust the bracelet, though, as each link pin is held in by two tiny bushings that are impossible to replace without the proper jeweler's tools.  Another bother is that the watch gains over a minute a day.  Overall, I really like it.  It's become my daily wear watch. 	pos
Without a Doubt, FFX is one of the best, if not the best, rpgs to come out on any of the current consoles.  It features an incredible and orignal story populated with interesting and varied characters.  Additionally, the sphere-gird system allows the player to develop character abilites in an interesting and innovative manner.  Admittedly, the sphere-grid system complexilty may scare away rpg newbies, but with a little time will become second nature to players of all skill levels.  Featuring a wonderful score (even by Final Fantasy standards)and impressive graphics (for the PS2) there is little reason for any video game fan not to pick up this title, even with the ever-present advent of FF 12 on the horizon	pos
I was not at all satisfied with the nightguard, but the company accepted the return without question and refunded my money promptly	neg

I was a little worried that the bracelet would be too large for a 5 year old, but I got this for my daughter's birthday and it fits her perfectly.  I was also a little concerned that it might be cheap looking like other things I've bought from Amazon lately, but it's actually a very cute, well-made, cheap bracelet	pos
The cable is really junk.  All I want is a cable to sync my phone and update software.  It won't do it.  Half of the time the computer fails to recognize the phone is connected.  A motorola brand data-only cable works just fine.  I was warned not to invest in cheap cables and I wish I would have listened.  The one potential plus is that it has a charger inline incase you nuke your phone and need to reload drivers.  Problem is, the thing connects and disconnects constantly torturing you with the beeps of connecting/disconnecting as mentioned above.  Save money and buy the OEM part. --- Moto cord $30 with software --- This cord $10 + $30 for moto cord when you realize it's junk.   --- Be smarter than me and heed the warnings	neg
Otherwise it would have 5 stars.  Fits my Treo 680 even in the case, which is a big plus	pos
many people have judged this album as a masterpiece i know. But to me this is just a collection of boring ambient sounds. This is unusual of me because i usually like ambient music. Another double ambient album - Seti - Pharos - is a real masterpiece. --- It is a real pity because the cover of this album is really stunning - but - you know - never judge the cover by its album.  --- Please if you have any feedback to this write to - carlogiova@yahoo.it - i would be happy to share thoughts.	neg

The upgrade is $75 cheaper and you DON'T need to have a previous install of Windows to get it to work. Simply do the following: ---  --- 1. Boot with the Windows Vista Upgrade DVD. ---  --- 2. Click "Install Now." ---  --- 3. Do not enter a Product Key When prompted.  ---  --- 4. When prompted, select the Vista product edition that you do have. ---  --- 6. Install Vista normally. ---  --- 7. Once the install is complete, restart the DVD-based Setup from within Windows Vista. Perform an in-place upgrade. 8. Enter your Product Key when prompted.  ---  --- This is according to Microsoft's internal documentation, and reported by Paul Thurrott at Windows IT Pro	neg
I like Meav's voice, and this CD is OK, if you like this kind of stuff. Think slow and somewhat depressing. I think Irish music has moved on so much since Bill Whehlan of Riverdance brought it into the modern times, and came up with this vocal sound, I guess to hark back to earlier times, which worked well because Riverdance has so much contrast in it and the choir songs only appear as relief to the other music. This is all a bit samey and dull. I would say saved by this lady's fine voice though	neg
Cosmetically pleasing is about the only good thing you can say about this unit.  The included software does contain viruses.  The included software is a reminate of the late 80's to early 90's.  The tablet itself does not work under Win2000 nor WinXP.  Under 98 second edition it stops responding quite frequetly and you have to unplug and plug the unit back in to get it to respond again.  This unit would be great, if it came out 7 years ago.  You get what you pay for	neg
i thought baby would be much more interested in this. it's colorful and easy to grab -- but for some reason, it's a non-starter	neg
Yes the coffee is the best quality, pesticide free.  There are technical issues with the pods. 1 pod was broken when I opened up the pouch it was stored in.  For any pods to arrive broken when they are so expensive is just not acceptable.  Also, many times the pod is not working, but turning it around and pressing down on it with a fork or a spoon makes it work (I have Black & Decker Home Cafe Machine).  Great coffee, but I felt that I had to really work for it.  I also feel that to charage $15 to ship a box of coffee pods is a bit excessive, considering that they are being shiped from LA not HI	pos
A great recording.  "The greatest bass solo ever recorded" (as put by another reviewer) is certainly a stretch, but the album is still magnificent.  Heavy Sounds is a title that accurately describes the music.  Buy and enjoy. 	pos

This product is the best!  It's so simple to use- no heat- no thermals- just the simple turning of a crank. Simple is often better and that is definitely the case here.  I use the tool to laminate spec sheets for selling high end sports cars and the result is super professional. I suggest also getting a paper cutter from staples because you may want to trim up the end product.	pos
This software only got one star because I couldnt give it a zero.  It never worked on my Windows XP computer.  I couldnt open the program, couldnt close it, couldnt get the sytem to shut down.

Two huge problems with this book. One, this self righteous club is leaving clues to a killer and "traveling and learning" when they already know his identity, so I guess he can keep on dismembering women until the psychiatrist figures it all out and then gets teary eyed over his new special wine glass. Two, the city of Los Angeles functions as a character in Kellerman's other novels and adds alot of realism to the novels. This thing drags on in some unnamed, nondescript city	neg
This seems to be a decent changing pad with the exception of it not being easy to clean. I am having a real hard time cleaning it and never had this problem with other changing pads. It's almost porous! If you get this changing pad, plan on having a cover on it at all times to keep it clean.	pos
I have owned this monitor for a little bit over one year and it died on me right after the one year warranty expired. The customer services rep told me that it will be $110 for a repair which I can almost buy a new one if I pay the shipping on top of that $110. I have other eight (8) LCD monitors in the house and no one has such a bad quality. I'll newver buy any Proview products ever. I will give zero star if there is one	neg
Back in the 1970's my grandmother subscribed to Prevention. At that time, it was a wonderful magazine, filled with informative articles aimed at the "Prevention" of illness and the promotion of wellness (as the founder of Prevention, J.I. Rodale had preached). Articles about the role of vitamins and nutrition were light years ahead of their time. (J.I. can be given a lot of credit for bringing vitamins and supplements to the mainstream). Over the years, and especially after the tragic death of Robert Rodale (J.I.'s son), and the takeover by his wife and daughter, it has unfortunately transformed into a fluffy, tabloid-like "women's magazine" with scantily clad women on the covers, and one- or two-page articles instructing women to get killer abs and burn the fat. I think J.I. Rodale is probably spinning in his grave to see what his descendents have done to butcher this magazine, which bears NO resemblence whatsoever to what it used to be. I flipped through a copy in disgust recently to note, as another reviewer has stated, plenty of ads for DRUGS which really seems to go against the idea of preventing illness in the first place (whereas the old Prevention sang the praises of vitamins and health foods). I don't know why the Rodale family doesn't just scrap the title and call it something else, but alas, they are a major corporation now and I have little hope that this magazine will improve any time soon	neg

I have used many infant tubs and I love this one!  It folds so nicely I keep it in the kitchen pantry.  It fits in the sink, and I keep the faucet running like a little shower, and I can rinse her with fresh water.  I actually think the angle is great for an infant, but with a newborn I use one of those "yellow bear sponges" in the tub for extra support (but I use one with all the infant tubs I have used). 	pos

I read rolling stone for the music and those who make it, not for some guilt ridden, agenda blasting editorial team that feels their politics (and guilt at being so much the establishment they wish they could hate) is something we should all read about at nauseum. when they stick to music, it's good, when they parade their shreiking political views, it's boring. 	neg
