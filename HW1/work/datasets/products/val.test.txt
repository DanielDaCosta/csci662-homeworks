Best snack I've found in years. I keep these in my desk at work for a mid-afternoon appetite curb. Highly recommended by all my family and friends
For the price, these speakers are well worth the cost. Of course, in my opinion, anything that dosnt say "Creative" on it is usually worth the price. Not a lot of bass, but with the bass boost, these speakers sound real nice. Only bad thing I'll say is that M-Audio's tech department is really bad. Emailed them about a week ago inquiring about driver updates for Vista, still no answer. (my inquiry was about a different m-audio product)
I love these!  The only thing good about being on a gluten free diet is discovering these cookies!  I'm hooked.  I love the coffee flavor mixed with chocolate.  And for a dessert all the ingredients are pretty good
I LOVE this DVD, in fact I purchased 5 to give as Baby Shower Extras! --- I originally taped it from HBO, and my 3 Grandchildren almost wore it out! --- I was delighted to see it available on DVD, so I bought 5, and am keeping one in my DVD Library for my Great-Grandchildren some day to enjoy!
I bought this camera two years ago, the pictures were always perfect, even though from the sixth month it started getting stains everywhere, but then i found out that it was normal, not good but it usually happens to this cameras. But the worst of all is tha fact that it displays the Error 18 (E18), the lens gets stock and the camera won't work at all. I searched in google about it, because the user guide says nothing about this error, and then I read many reviews that said that there was nothing to do about it and many Canon cameras have the same defect... I am really mad and dissapointed on CANON, i will never buy a camera of this brand, and I wouldn't recommend it, unless you are willing to buy a camera for 2 years or LESS and then throw your money to the trash
I have thick, wavy hair and this product did nothing but make it feel wirey and frizzy. I don't think it is worth the money when I have found other poducts (such as Redken) that work better and cost less
Mr. Dennett's book demonstrates the ignorance, irrationality, and dishonesty  of humanists. Discussing the meaning of word materialsim, Professor Dennett says: ---  --- "In its scientific or philosophical sense, it refers to a theory that aspires to explain all the phenomena without recourse to anything immaterial--like a Cartesian soul, or "ectoplasm"--or God. The standard negation of materialistic in the scientific sense is dualistic, which maintains that there are two entirely different kinds of substance, matter and ...whatever minds are supposedly made of." (p. 302) ---  --- Philosophers stopped believing in dualism a thousand years ago with the development of metaphysics. A modern view is that man is an indefinability that becomes conscious of its own existence.  ---  --- The philosophy that God does not exist is not materialism, it is naturalism. Materialism is the view that all that exists is matter. Materialists frequently say that free will is an illusion and that the experience of the existence of oneself is some kind of epiphenomena. (In a quote below, you will see that Dennett puts free will in a list of things people belief in.) ---  --- It is not clear from the book whether Dennett is a materialist, but he is certainly a naturalist. Concerning the proof of God's existence, he trots out David Hume's "Who made God?" which is based on a misunderstanding of the principle of causality. I refer the reader to my personal website for my version of the proof. ---  --- Let's look at two quotes, the first is at the end of the chapter "Belief in Belief" and the other at the beginning of the chapter "Morality and Religion":  ---  --- "That is, isn't it true that, whether or not God exists, religious belief is at least as important as the belief in democracy, in the rule of law, in free will? The very widespread (but far from universal) opinion is that religion is the bulwark of morality and meaning." (p. 245) ---  --- " Without the divine carrot and stick, goes this reasoning, people would loll about aimlessly or indulge their basest desires, beak their promises, cheat on their spouses, neglect their duties, and so on.  There are two well-known problems with this reasoning: (1) it doesn't seem to be true, which is good news, since (2) is is such a demeaning view of human nature." (p. 279) ---  --- In the first chapter, he mentions "bulwark of morality" and "meaning." But in the second chapter, he leaves out "meaning."  If our purpose in life is not to get to heaven, what is our purpose is life?  ---  --- Whether religion supports morality can be determined by observing whether there is a correlation of moral conduct with religious belief. Mr. Dennett makes such a correlation to the detriment of religion by citing the high divorce rate of fundamentalist Christians. ---  --- There are worse things than divorcing your spouse. Disingenuousness can be worse and can take the form of leaving unsaid what should have been said. Mr. Dennett should have explained why he did not discuss the idea that religion gives meaning to life. ---  --- The only miracle mentioned in Mr. Dennett's book is the Shroud of Turin, which has on it a mysterious image of a crucified man.  Since no one claims to know how the image got there, it can be called a miracle. However, Mr. Dennett does not tell us anything about it. The reader is left to find out about the famous relic by looking it up on the internet.
 --- I agree with the person who said it's hard to chew and here is why. ---  --- Disect your slim jim length ways...there, do you see the hair? --- It is (allegedly) all made of cow hair...gross! That is the beef part I guess. --- Trans-fat (partially hydrogenated veg oil) and some really long word chemicals to make "mechanically separated" beef and chicken what looks like hair taste "good"? no thanks, glad I did not buy 100! ---  --- My dog really likes it but then again she eats other dog's p..p --- EEWWW!!!
Is Larry an actual redneck, or is it all really a joke inside "Larry's" mind?  I sometimes think that Dan Whitney (Larry's real name) knows what he's doing.  I think he is actually making a huge joke out of the rednecks who are totally in love with him.  He is openly mocking them, and when they might get a tad uncomfortable, but then he'll drop a politically incorrect joke into the routine, and they love him again.  Dan/Larry started out as a "normal" comedian (there's footage of him on youtube before his Larry incarnation), and wasn't really getting anywhere with that.  So he became a redneck, and is a multi-millionare now.  But all his redneck fans think of Larry as a "regular guy", despite the fact that Larry lives in one of those fancy houses that rednecks think only NYCers live in (for the record, NYCers don't all live in fancy houses.  There's a lot of working class people in NYC who live in regular houses and regular apartments).  So Larry is taking advantage of illiterate, easily amused rednecks.  Just put on a flannel shirt, fart, wear a Confederate flag, and say you hate liberals, then fleece the rednecks!  I don't think Larry really has a redneck mentality (even though he's originally from Nebraska, so he has some hillbilly cred, so to speak).  I think he's just making a ton of money off of easily amused people.     
This thermometer is totally worthless. It doesn't read the correct temp. on myself, husband or baby. When my little one was sick at 3 months old, this thing read 96.7 degrees on all three of us. I picked up a digital 'under the tongue' type and simply used it under his arm. Works great--cost me $3.   ---    ---  I can't GIVE this one away
WHat I like best is that it is non addictive. It puts you right to sleep within 20-30 minutes. It really helped me and my boyfriend regulate our sleep patterns
Adds a great fragrance to the room. We bought several different scents and placed them throughout the house. It's a different smell in every room. What a pleasant change from smelling the pets.
My 4 year old really wanted this for Christmas, after looking at similar products, we chose this one.  Should have spent the money on the one w/the DVD.  Tutu is WAY TOO SMALL - fits her 18" doll.  Mat is a little too sensitive, she tries to put her feet in the position and kicks off the music pads.  Only 2 instructions - feet up, feet down. On the other arms up, arms down.  Bar isn't very stable.  Company should save the money they spent putting in the tutu and slippers and create a more helpful mat.  My daughter will press the music button on the mat and then dance off it. 
True to its name it has high sensitivity. Too much that on a very smooth surface this mouse becomes live.Start moving in all directions. ---  --- On my couch the mouse is dead. --- If the surface is smooth the mouse laser is too sensitive. --- But when the surface is soft or rough the mouse gets stuck. The paws/foot of the mouse is sticky. ---  --- Not sure if this is a defective but really hate this mouse.... --- I am returning this product. ---  --- Even at the slowest speed it is difficult to click a checkbox on the screen. --- 
For the price, I expected a toy. I was surprised to open the box and find an honest to goodness classical guitar. The construction, fit and finish are impeccable. The sound is certainly not concert quality, but that is to be expected on a $50 dollar instrument. The tuning is reasonably accurate, and it is a pleasure to play. I have told me son about it and he is going to buy one for his son.
A wonderful version of Sinbad the Sailor. Great sets, costumes, and story line. Douglass Fairbanks is great in it
I like the GTA series of games and this one is great too. I can turn up my settings to max (My computer is over a year old) and there are no problems. The kid reviewer claims that he doesn't like the "N/F bomb". That is why this is rated M for Mature (so he should not even be playing it). To give the series a taste some things cannot be eliminated. ---  --- This is a fun games just exploring the city or completing missions
Actually, I loved the Philips Acoustic Edge, an earlier and internal sound card, but it did not like my older dual-processor system.  Because of that I was a bit skittish about using their current internal card with a processor that uses hyper-threading - which Windows treats as dual processors.  I bought the Aurelium instead.  I love this thing!  I am a bit of an audiophile, and this sound card is just perfect.  With my Klipsch computer speakers, it makes a perfect combination
The last ball I had requirted the bicycle pump to fill it. I'm just too lazy to run out and find the bike pump every time I need a little more air. The pump that comes with this ball doubles for filling other things too. At my kids birthday party I used it to fill some inflatable decorations and I've used it to fill an air mattress. So two things: the ball is easily inflated and the pump is handy
I purchased this from Amazon based on the description that a long lasting rechargeable battery was included.  However when it arrived, there was no battery.  Upon questioning Amazon about the battery, the customer service rep said he could give me a $5 credit for the batteries.  I asked how the battery could only be worth $5.  He said that is what AA rechargeable batteries go for. The bag is ok, but don't order this if you are expecting a battery specifally made for compact printers
This series may be good for a laugh. Some of the writing is engaging.  ---  --- But the premise is absurd.  ---  --- WHY, in this day and age, should anyone accept the world-view of the Bible? A book that tells us to buy and sell slaves, stone our wives to death if they accept some other tribe's beliefs, and subordinate our minds to an absolute despot up in the clouds of Mt. Sinai?  ---  --- In a sense, Bible believers have been "left behind" since the 1700s Enlightenment. Tom Paine's "The Age of Reason" showed the God of the Bible to be a cruel, vindictive monster. And what did Thomas Jefferson call the book of Revelations? "The ravings of a madman."  ---  --- Read this series, if you like. Enjoy parts of it. But make no mistake: to take any of this seriously, you have to regress to a prehistoric world-view, before men learned to think, to ask questions; before logic or science -- a time when dazed, superstitious primitives believed stars could fall to the earth, if they didn't grovel humbly enough to their supposed god.  ---  --- Do the absurdities and contradictions bother no one? When the "sheep" are raptured up to heaven, their clothes are left behind. So heaven is a nudist colony?  ---  --- The basic contradiction, of course, lies in using worldly action (some of it exciting) to proselytize for the unworldly, the supernatural.  ---  --- But why should we care whether any of the "good" guys gets killed? And why should THEY mind -- won't they go straight up to heaven? That's what they WANT, isn't it? Why even lift a finger against the "bad" guys -- didn't Christ say, "Resist not evil"?  ---  --- Worried about who will win? "God" is infinitely powerful. So Jesus (who is 1/3 of God -- or something like that) is sure to win when Armageddon rolls around, in book 12 of the series. And the "sheep" -- the believers -- will happily worship him, looking just like the pictures of dim-witted, bovine people you see in the tracts Jehovah's Witnesses leave at your door.  ---  --- The going price for a used copy of "Tribulation Force" is one cent. Does that tell you something?  ---  --- Actually, the story-telling is worth more. The basic premise is worth less. Perhaps it averages out
I love Pablo's act on Comedy Central.  This one doesn't even touch it
This Biscotti is just awful, too sweet and too hard.  La Tempesta is a real Biscotti
Having had Norton products installed for years including AntiVirus, Internet Security, and SystemWorks, I decided to replace the installed products with Norton 360 and a non-Norton password manager.  Obviously, it is critical to FIRST remove all Norton programs before installing Norton 360.  The installation process proceeded relatively smoothly. ---  --- My computing environment includes a 1.6Ghz processor, 1,000MB of memory, and 6GB of available disk.   ---  --- The background scans and LiveUpdate have played havoc with my other applications by periodically locking up the entire CPU at 100% CPU utilization.  One application that streams radio broadcasts now stops.  I immediately disabled the automatic updates and scheduled backups, however, the CPU occasionally still locks.   ---  --- Additionally, there is no way to transfer security settings from previous Norton products to Norton 360 thereby making the installation process very labor intensive. ---  --- If you now have separate Norton security products and are satisfied with them, save your money and renew the Norton subscriptions.
I recently bought a pair of the reflector cover from photoblocker store on Amazon.  After I put it on my plates I have been through several red light intersections in the evenings on numerous occasions and to date I have yet to receive a fine, I believe the reflector cover has already paid for itself.
Great fun way to practice chipping in my backyard.  It provides a great way of having a backyard practice chipping game with my friends.  Another product that I found quite valuable is ---  --- "The Ultimate Golf Instruction Guide: Key Techniques for Becoming a Zero Handicap Golfer or Better" by Patrick Leonardi --- This book has very practical information on the short game and long game, which lead to my improvement on the golf range and on the golf course.   ---  --- For leisure reading, I also suggest --- "New Rules: Polite Musings from a Timid Observer"  by Bill Maher --- This book is hilarious, very funny observations about famous people in the world
I only paid 39.99 and it was still a rip-off.  It says it's 1 inch by 1 inch, but it's about the size of a dime!!!  So dissappointed.  Sending it back
This package is very complete and easy to use.  Took just a few minutes to be drawing house layouts, et.  A lot of the tools are intuitive and simple
This is a great watch for people who are trying their hand at outdoor sports.  It is easy to use and not too bulky.  Wish is was made of a more durable material other than plastic, but like I mentioned it is great for a beginner to practice.  It has all of the main functions of watches costing much more so it does the job.  It is a very clean and smart looking watch
Its tough to beat the price of these 1/2 ct. diamonds for $199; they looked really good and the wife loved them.  The only reason I gave 4 stars is because they only have non-screw backs and they didn't come with a diamond spec sheet to verify what you got.  But for the price, a minor quibble... you won't be disappointed with your purchase
It's the best product I've used to create volume and hold.  I didn't notice it after blow drying, but, while using the curling iron and styling - my hair had a lot more volume and great hold.  I have straight, fine, limp hair and it is very difficult to get it to hold a style.  I truely noticed a big difference.  I plan to purchase the other volumizing products, once they are in stock.
Very fun I love it is like a dream in a book the wings do fall of but not often. what I say is YES get it
I purchased three of these for three Kodak easyshare cameras --- I gave as gifts. It was a great buy for much less than what --- you can get at any local stores
Amazing program! Definitely building my skills in the interior design field. Would recommend to anyone
I bought two of these trikes for my 19 month old twin sons.  Within the first 10 minutes of use, they both tipped over numerous times.  They tipped over when they were trying to use the pedals and also when they were just using their feet on the floor. Definitely not a sturdy trike.  My husband and I were very disappointed and returned them immediately. ---  --- In reading other reviews, I see that our experience with these trikes is not unique
This toy is not what I had expected. It isn't very durable at all and it's HARD to put together! I don't highly recommend it
I had to return this item because it was too short for the side of my tub.  I would have to kneel on the knee pad to make it stretch and then sometimes the elbow pad would pop off.  I ended up trying it by just removing the stretch fabric and elbow pad, but then it became just an expensive knee stool.  The knee stool portion of this product was the only useful part to me and that is why I give it 2 stars rather than 1.  I returned it because you can get just the kneel stool from other companies for half the price
I gave this game to my 13 year old nephew for Christmas.  He actually wrote me a thank you note for it.  In the note he said "I like it better than normal Monoply.  There's a lot more thinking and strategy involved".  I might even go up to five stars
Motor Trend never fails to deliver. I like the fact that they cover such a wide variety of vehicles, everything from SUVs, CUVs, trucks, sportscars, import "tuners", sub-compacts, high-priced exotics, concepts and rumors. The news is fresh and accurate, the issues arrive on time, the mags are thick, pics are crisp, letters are interesting and articles provide usefull information
I have used These Seagate Drives for almost 2 years now. They work nicely for editing movies, and I like the combo Firewire and USB2.0 interface. I trust these cheaper Seagate than the expensive LACIE (we bought a box full of lacie D2, they ALL fail in 6 months) or store brand drives. Hard drives are prone to failure. But Seagate has served my company well. ---  --- using : Seagate 750GB, 500GB, 400GB. daisy chained.... --- 
On paper, the idea of a 24 video game sounds like a great idea, and upon first glance of it, it seems like it's firing on all cylinders.  Featuring all the major players from the series reprising their roles (Kiefer Sutherland, Dennis Haysbert, Elisa Cuthbert, etc.) and a storyline and tone and atmosphere that captures the feel of the show, 24: The Game falls apart once you get further into it.  The missions are repetitive, the animation and graphics are jumpy and glitched, and the controls are unresponsive to say the least.  Targeting enemies is a chore at times as you use the analog sticks, but the targeting along with just plain moving gets incredibly cumbersome thanks to a camera that seems to want to work against you.  Some of this could be forgiveable, but the further you get through 24 the more rushed the game feels.  It's a shame too, considering how innovative the series was in it's early life and everything the game had going for it.  If more polish was put into it, 24: The Game could have been something special, but as it is, it's only recommended as a rental for fans of the series
I have an ICS M4A1.  I am basing my thoughts on this based on what some of the airsoft forums I am registered to have said on this.  I am registered on Arnies, Airsoft Core, and Airsoft Retreat. ---  --- 1) This gun is from a very, very unreliable company (Well), so you have more chances of getting a bad gun than you do for getting a good one.  This is common knowledge among the airsoft community. ---  --- 2) Lets say you buy 4 of these guns... each of them costing 100 dollars.  Even over a 5-10 year span, that adds up to a lot of money being spent on a gun that breaks consistantly.  People who have skirmished with an LPEG (Low-Powered Electric Gun) find that the exterior can actually break if shot at with an AEG that shoots 330 FPS with .2g (standard for companies like Toyko Marui, ICS, Classic Army, G&G, Airsoft Elite).  The one thing that this suggests that the gun is badly made. ---  --- 3) The gearbox (part of gun that fires bbs) broke on mine.  In short, it has a metal gearbox, made of the cheapest metal known to man.  The purpose of this for the company that makes to this get money.  It is very, very weak.  Definitely not worth it. ---  --- 4) The "Hop-Up" on this gun is non-existant.  The fundamentals of hop-up is a backspin is added to BBs to increase range and accuracy.  Effective range of this- 50 feet (not meters).  Effective range of my ICS M4A1 (with a aftermarket tightbore added) is 150 feet. ---  --- 5) This gun will get laughed at.  Some children walk into an organized skirmish with this LPEG, telling people that it will own all others, and they will cry home when players with real AEGS destroy them.  I suppose it is fine for backyard wars, but who on Earth would spend 100 dollars for a crappy gun for backyard wars? ---  --- 6) The cost does not equal quality.  If you think about all of the accessories that come with this gun (light, laser, ect), then account for shipping from CHINA, then the packaging costs (pre-molded styrofoam), you will realize that this gun is very, very cheaply made.  You do not want to be spending so much for so little quality.  The laser itself can sell for 20 dollars. ---  --- Put it short, it is not worth it
This album bores me out of my mind. Only two decent tracks: Bad boys and Bonnie and Clyde. And I'm no avid radio listener. BET and MTV actually hit the nail on the head with these tracks. So i guess they good for somethin
These are by far the BEST newborn size diapers especially for small babies, but if you order them through Amazon, your baby may outgrow them before they even arrive!  I waited 5 weeks then cancelled the order and ordered size 1, which Actually arrived in a few days! ---  --- Update: I have ordered Pampers again through Amazon (different size) and they shipped right away
This machine literally broke within the first 15 minutes after it had been assembled, I couldn't believe it.  My advice would be to avoid this product
I purchased this hairdryer after my professional Conair Yellowbird from the late 70's broke.  I definitely wanted another Conair and I wanted to move into the 21st Century!  I did the research and this hairdryer had the most features for the best price.  I wasn't disappointed.  As the other reviewers have stated, this hairdryer dries your hair in half the time!  It's also nice to reduce the static in your hair when you want to freshen up and are "dry brushing" your hair.  It does draw a lot of power when on high heat and the highest blowing setting and the lights in my dressing room will dim.  Otherwise, it is very solidly built and I hope to have this hairdryer for another 30 years.
This did not help my skin AT ALL. I would not reccomend it to anyone! Save your money!
I've been using a Mac for the last 10+ years and I had assumed that Windows had gotten better since Win 94.  Boy was I wrong.  It amazes me that the entire world runs on this awful excuse for an OS.
I bought these skates for my daughter from Sport Authority.  Since we both wear the same size, I decided I would try and skate in them after my daughter.  She complained the wheels would not roll and when I tried to loosen them with a skate tool, they wouldn't loosen at all.  I tried to skate in them as well and I almost fell on my face.  I wasn't expecting the same quality as my professional skates, but at least hoped for skates that rolled safely!
Kissaluvs are the best! They keep baby dry while being incredibly breathable.  Baby's skin doesn't get red like it does with disposable diapers.  Also great for keeping in those wonderful breastmilk poops.
For the first couple of weeks the Snack Trap worked perfectly. After that, my daughter (7 months old) figured out how to remove the top (it is just a soft plastic cover like a tupperware, but easily removed), and we have since been struggling to keep her from dumping, throwing, or shaking the snacks all around the house. ---  --- On the positive side, the flaps for the top are very soft, and when she does reach in, there is no worry about her harming her hands or fingers. If only the lid had a locking mechanism or was screwed on, then this would work perfectly. As it is, my daughter loves it, but we hate cleaning up the mess
As a lover of gospel bluegrass I anticipated an enjoyable listening session with Blue Highway's latest offering. Let me first say that I am a fan of this group, which I consider to be one of the premier groups in bluegrassdom, but what I heard was bluegrass Muzak. Yes, the group's tight harmonies and excellent musicianship were in evidence, and that is what saved this disc from being sold to the local reseller, but the lack of inspiration and excitement was disappointing. Gospel music, even bluegrass Gospel, has a tendency to preachiness and taking itself too seriously as this disc proves. A good Gospel recording MUST have some cuts which are humorous, some serious and contemplative, some that push the envelope of orthodoxy, and most importantly it must have an element of FUN in order to keep the attention of the listeners. This disc fails in that regard containing standard old Gospel chestnuts along with some original songs that ape the oldtime standards. My advice is to either borrow it from a friend before buying new, or buy used. Want mine
This is not your father's business magazine. Picked it up for the first time in a doctor's office and stole the issue (on real estate)
The earrings were exactly what I wanted.  The delivery date was as promised. 
This griddle is very useful, especially if you bring your grill to the camp site.  The surface cooks evenly and if sufficiently heated does a good job.   ---  --- At first I thought it was solid cast iron but upon further inspection found that it has some kind of high temperature coating.  My only criticism is that it isn't a more non-stick surface and food can be hard to clean off after use. ---  --- The gee whiz factor is great when you whip it out around other people who have the little stamped metal travel grills.  This item really rounds out the Baby Q's options.   --- 
These are absolutely the most fashionable and adorable shoes on earth. They are right on the mark. I love them so much that I am ordering my second pair..not because the first fell apart, but because I simply have to have more than one pair
I bought this product in the color Paparazzi from Sephora - online, I read wonderful reviews about it in the magazines.  I was very disappointed when I finally got it and tried it. There is way too much glitter in it for anyone over 13.  I could not wear this to work or even an evening out as I would feel like a clown.  The only place this would look semi-good at would be a nightclub where it is dark. I was hoping for more of a shimmer than pure glitter.  I do not recommend this product at all. I also returned this promptly back to Sephora.     
Returned item, as was leaking all over. Great product if Amazon had packed it better, I could have used it
Its a great product it coats when it rains when you just put it on you dont even need to use the wipers but it does take some work to make sure its not smeared looking.   Clean your glass good with windex first then apply and polish off. I dont really buy any of those as seen on TV items but this is the first one that really works well also if you side windows squeak this will help with that as well since is a slippery it will help with weather stripping.  Remember this works best when over about 40mph... and you will have to keep reapplying a few times a yea
Nothing. Not even a trailer. What a wasted opportunity for a commentary by West (who does do them -- he did one for When A Stranger Calls) or a retrospective featurette. ---  --- All you do get with this extended version is additional dialogue between Cusack's character and a female law enforcement officer in a hanger, footage of a prison riot during the opening credits montage and a few more graphic shots of hapless inmates being killed during the course of the movie
It's good to see that in his twilight years, old squinty eyes, Clint Eastwood is growing comfortable playing grouchy old dudes, because, well, he is a grouchy old dude. This movie is anemic from the beginning. Taken from a wonderful novel by Michael Connelly, Clint plays an old grouchy dude who's just gotten a new ticker because his last one gave out while chasing a serial killer. Run, run, run, THUD. Next, new ticker intact, Clint is hired to find the murderer of a cute black woman by her sister, another cute black woman. Oh, and CBW#2 plays the guilt card on Clint, because he's got his new ticker courtesy of CBW#1. So there's a little bit of investigative work, a little but of huffin' and a puffin', and finally Clint discovers who the serial killer is who was responsible for his first ticker giving out and the murder of the donor of his second ticker. Jeff Daniels plays a doofus that lives next door to Clint. What a stretch. Special warning: Clint takes off his shirt yet again in this film as he smooches on CBW#2. It must be in his contract or something. No one, and I mean, NO ONE wants to see saggy Clint with his shirt off. For a much, much better Clint movie, go rent "Unforgiven"
I just bought this cd because I am learning Haitian creole, and that's one of the languages that is supposed to be on this cd. When I installed it, I was unable to find anything on the CD in Haitian creole, even though it is listed as one of the languages on the case. So it has been a complete waste of money for me, perhaps if I was interested in the other languages I could give it more stars. --- It also says in the blurb that u can use any of the 16 languages as the source language, but that is not possible either, u can only chooose a few of the languages as your source. I am very disappointed in the false advertising for this product. If anyone can find creole on this cd I would be happy to stand corrected. --- PS I contacted IMSI and they say the cd's were mislabelled, there is no haitian creole on the cd, despite the fact that it is listed on the cover
I think there was packaging or a sticker that compared this film to Pulp Fiction.  As if.  Beyond minor superficial similarities - I dont see it. ---  --- Le Samurai is one of the most boring films Ive watched recently without turning it off.  In retrospect I wish I had turned it off or never wasted my time since the ending is so dull.   ---  --- Imagine if breathless had a slightly more complicated plot, but the main character had no charisma.  Or if Alphaville (the film not the treatment) was more 100 times more boring.  Le Samurai makes Tokyo Drifter seem like a thrill ride.  I was not impressed by this film on any level. ---  --- If you are into being bored.  Or if your so freaking smart you can watch paint drying and fill it with significance, this is the film for you
I'm a diehard Nikon fan.  My first Nikon was a gift from my father when I was 13.  Since then, photography has been a serious hobby, having had a few photos published and even spent time working in a photo lab while in college.  Having said that, and after reading several reviews about people having trouble focusing this camera, I absolutely agree with them.  Someone responded by saying those reviewers haven't read the manual.  Baloney.  I bought the Coolpix L1 to replace a 4 year old Coolpix 850.  The L1's camera's focus feature works fine in the daylight and works for s**t indoors, especially with the macro settings.  I've been patient and have given it three months.  I am fed up.  This camera is going back to amazon in the morning
At least this author mentions the "mockery" strategy Martha/Mdiddy tried to use to "fog" the public. The "real issue" of whether Martha/Mdiddy committed the crimes, and lack of an effort to encourage an answer to the question "DID MARTHA STEWART" lie, demonstrates some complacency. Is it this complacency Martha/Mdiddy and her pr team try to encourage and promote? Is it the "greyness" of white-collar crime that Martha/Mdiddy was trying to play on? Is society the ultimate judge about a person's guilt or innocence? If so, what has Martha/Mdiddy been judged? --- Be "thoughtful" --- ~Shaw
Toy makes EXTREMELY loud animal noises, along with a screeching motor when backing up or at top speed going forward.  My son enjoyed the heck out of it for about 2 minutes before my wife said it was going back to the store, which is exactly what I was thinking. ---  --- At least 3-4x louder than any other toy i've ever seen, let alone purchased. ---  --- Also when performing its "flip" maneuver, it gets stuck 70% of the time and then makes the same screeching motor sound while it repeatedly tries to reset its "flip arm". ---  --- Might be okay for just outside use if you can stand a lot of high pitched noise. ---  --- Controller was extremely toddler friendly compared to other RC toys.  Toy also seemed fairly tough.
I love this pendant. Very shiny and substantial - the back looks as good as the front.  I also wear this on a black leather cord (16") and it gives it a whole new look.  Great buy
I was eager to read this book, but after reading it I was left completely flat.  The rest of the iceberg?  Hardly. ---  --- Smith barely gives us more than what we could get from reading Sports Illustrated, or any Minnesota sports page.  He admits he's not a fan of football, but for the majority of the book leisurely describes the most basic parts of his football career.   ---  --- This book is touted as: his full and complete story.  So we learned he was watching Ren & Stimpy during his NFL Draft.  Wow, are these the types of meaty stories that we want to read? ---  --- How about telling us more of the inside details...  How did Smith deal with people who wanted to be his friends or girlfriends only because he was a star football player?  Who were his friends that he could trust, and when did he need that trust?  What thoughts enter your mind as you look to hire an agent?  What was he doing when he was "goofing off and missing class all summer" which led to one of the most covered stories of his time at Ohio State?  When, and why did he begin using pot?  If football is not "smart" enough for him, why doesn't he study and break down some of the coaching process that is more mentally challenging?  What happened to plans for medical school?  We know the stories of football; those are the parts of the iceberg that have already been documented. ---  --- I also felt Smith wrote this book as if he is defending himself from all of America.  Who is attacking him?  Why does he feel the need to explain why he was paid so much?  Highly paid athlete stories are, sorry for the pun, a dime a dozen.  He tries to compare his sitting out for more money to a scenario for the average guy.  The truth is, many people will take a job for 5% less than a co-worker because yes, they value things other than money, and yes, they are happy to have a job.   ---  --- Leaving the grammatical errors to the other reviewers, it felt like I was reading an average high school creative writing project.  'I did this, I did that, I went to bed, next day.'  Half of his quotes are from the wellspring of deep philosophy: pop music.  Smith notes "less than 50 percent of Americans read at a 10th-grade level".  Well, this book certainly won't tax the reading ability of too many people. ---  --- One lesson from this book is that Smith had opportunities to swallow his pride, take some coaching, and come up with a better solution.  This book is another one of those times.  He should have hired an editor or writing consultant who could give guidance.  Build the characters; help us feel their stories.  Instead, Smith felt it necessary to go alone to get to the raw emotions.  Sorry, but compared to other autobiographies, this was not an emotional book. ---  --- I'm sure Smith is all the things that Mike Gutter says he is, such as: thoughtful, honest, trustworthy, dependable, passionate...  but I felt that some of the best stories that would demonstrate these characteristics were left out of this book.   ---  --- Instead, we are still looking for the rest of the iceberg.
I have subscribed to "In Touch" since September last year and it's time to renew, but I'm not goint to....because this megazine is never arrived on time (at least 5 of them just failed to arrive), I don't know wether i should wait for it or call customer service. I would go to the store and buy it instead because the megazine itself is very entertaining.  
My two year old has several of these cars, and the race track. He loves all things Cars, so these were a big hit. All of the Shake and Go Cars talk before they run, which he especially likes. They are VERY easy for a toddler to operate, but his four year old sister enjoys playing with them, too. They don't run for very long per shake, but that doesn't seem to bother him at all
I purchased this product about 2 months ago, the resolution is not the best but it's acceptable. After a month,it turned off by itself and wouldn't turn on again!! I sent it to repair and had to pay $50.00 !!!somenthing to do with the power button. I have it on a UPS with battery, also freezes for no reason. I don't recomend it
I must have missed something about this book.  I can't believe that Minority Report and Total Recall, two movies that I did enjoy, came from this author.  The stories seem to be missing something.  Perhaps, this version should not have been the first works by this author for me to have read
I bought this curling iron impulsively, as I perused through the "gold box" items some time ago.  When I first received the it, I was amazed at how well it worked; it heated up quickly, and did a wonderful job on my hair.  After a couple months, I turned it on, left the room for a minute, and came back to find the tip melted off, hanging from a strand of what little plastic was still attached.  I thought about returning it, but decided (rather stupidly, in retrospect) to continue to use it...BIG MISTAKE.  It heated up way beyond what it should have, even when I put it at a "low" setting of 5.  When I attempted to use it, the sizzling sound indicated to me that I had, indeed, made a mistake.  The next day, coworkers were commenting on my lovely new SHORT haircut.  If you're really interested in purchasing this item, please learn from my mistake, and if the tip melts off, take that as a sign that it will also melt your hair
I am so greatfull to this pump! I was able to exclusively breastfeed two children for a year each, while working full time, taking vacations (without the kids), etc. I also have the car adapter which is awesome, I was able to pump to and from my work, (which is over an hour away), while driving. I only recommend that for breatfeeding/pumping pros! The warranty is only good for a year, but mine is now three years old and still going strong. We are expecting our third child and I hope my pump holds up for another year, if not I will still probably spend the money on another pump like this one! Best of luck
I find these ear buds to be absolutely uncomfortable. I would rate the product a zero if it were an option. I can't even use them because they're too uncomfortable to wear. Not worth the money, even though they're cheap
Help!  This program will not let me print all of my address's unto christmas labels.  When you go down to the arrow to check all address's it will not move.  Any Help would be appreciated. ---  --- Thank
That's right!  A quote from Detective Eames on Law & Order:  Criminal Intent.  She and Goren were in a garage and she pointed out a chamois cloth and smelled it and that's when she said, "Meguiar's, the good stuff.  My father used to use it on his ..." --- The first time I saw that episode I didn't know what she was talking about.  But I saw it the other day (on Bravo) and I got it!  That's because I have become an avid fan of Meguiar's products since I bought a Mercedes 7 months ago!   --- This product I mostly use on the interior.  It is like a magnet for wiping the dash and wood trim.  You hardly need the sprays but they are good too.  Keep one handy in your glove comparment. --- It gives a great shine on the outside whey you use it with Meguiar's Quik Detailer Spray. Enjoy
Sooo cute.  Santa gave my 7 y.o. daughter the dog and cat versions of this game.  She and I have already spent several hours playing with her "pets".  Unlike the earlier pets, there is more to do than just care for your pet.  There are games, activities and interactions with pet friends.  There is a whole village of homes and places to visit.   ---  --- You collect stickers throughout your adventures.  For instance there are 29 stickers available for making friends.  It is represented by a heart sticker.  Everytime you collect a sticker, you are taken to your sticker book and it indicates how many stickers are available and how many you have obtained.   ---  --- There are three exterior buttons for use to play with, groom and feed your pet.  When your pet ignores you, it means it is time for grooming, playing or eating.   ---  --- Sometimes your pet will suddenly disappear and then reappear at their potty mat having left a little undesirable.  My daughter thinks that is hilarious.  Kids!   ---  --- The only drawback is that the screen does not light up for play while travelling after dark.  Maybe they'll improve upon that in the next versions
My son is enthralled with this game!  He is learning while being entertained.  The graphics are exceptional, music is great, situations are complex and challenging and it works on the MAC!  What more could we ask for
Hi, I just recently purchased this phone. and so far these are the problems. Yes you do have to restart the device, it does get hung, but i don't blame the phone, after all it has windows mobile 5 in it. The restart has occurred twice to me in the past week, So be careful. This phone is pretty close to being perfect. Other than the fact that it has windows, The 3G connection is crazy fast and it is amazing to have. If you take this phone be ready to take a good data connect plan as even thought it has wifi capabilities, Cingular has programed it to first connect to their data connect feature.. which in return will give u a nice thick bill.. Once you buy the phone i suggest that  you get this software Spb Pocket plus. It helps shutting down softwares running in the background, and adds more features. The screen clarity is amazing and it has great features. It can connect up to 6 bluetooth devices at once. Overall i give it a 4 because of the hardware. the one star missing is cause it has Windows. Sorry Microsoft but you need to remove the bugs outta this windows too.
Cooks illustrated rated this product the best and so do I. I purchased two as gifts, one for my husband and one for my son-in-law for fathers day. Both are extreamly pleased with the product.
I saw this movie in the 1986 theatrical re-release and subsequently on DVD. I can readily attest that it does not age! I'm not even a dog person myself, but the plot is not about dogs per say, but the life adventures that a young cocker spaniel named Lady has.  ---  --- Living with owners named Darling and Jim Dear, Lady apparently leads a pretty good life. Assuming that every dog leads the good life she and her friends enjoy, she is later shocked to meet Tramp, who lives on the streets. However, she soon realizes that he has a good heart beneath that rough exterior.  ---  --- She needs his help when crusty old Aunt Sarah comes to mind the house--and the newborn baby. Initially not understanding that Lady feels protective towards the baby, she also selectively ignores the damage which her two Siamese cats were actually responsible for doing to that very elaborate Victorian house.  ---  --- Amazingly, Aunt Sarah presumes that Lady was responsible for wrecking the house--and attempts to muzzle her up! ---  --- Like any streetwise character, Tramp has lots of connections and solutions to any problem which pops up. However, he does not come across as an annoying know-it-all who you would want to quickly get rid of. Tramp is instead somebody whom we are supposed to both identify and then want to hang out with in rough environments. Lady had 'gentle' friends named Jock and Trusty, but they can't help out in a world also outside of their own.    ---  --- Of course, the spaghetti dinner scene remains one of the most enduring of all time--it made a VERY profound impact on me well before I was even old enough to myself consider dating. I imagined that I would eventually share a romantic dinner of my own with my own "Mr. right".  ---  --- However, Tramp's decision to go after the rat in the nursery also remains a powerful scene. He then felt no loyalty to anybody in that family other than Lady, but saved the baby anyway! Tramp proved that class is not a matter of breeding but what you do with your self!  ---  --- Despite his earlier professed discomfort with collars, Tramp ultimately gets adopted by the Darlings. Therefore, he and Lady do in fact live happily ever after. ---  
Over the years, I have tried many different brands and types of heated rollers and I never liked using any of them.  I recently bought a new set which I had to return due to the fact that I had a terrible time trying to roll my hair on the almost smooth surface of the rollers and then after clipping the rolls, they would immediately fall out of my hair....scream! I bought the Remmington #1080N wax core roller set and I have finally found the easiest and quickest  way to curl my hair.  The rollers surface, when warm, grab the hair ends immediately to allow great control when trying to roll even short hair.  The rollers are held in place by a full clip which looks more like a comb so the clips do not leave a ridge in my hair.  Once heated, the rollers are relatively cool to the touch (no more burned fingers) but due to the wax core, the rollers hold plenty of     heat and it takes just a few minutes after setting to produce excellent, long lasting results.  The set takes about 10 - 15 minutes to warm up.  I've found the warm up time takes longer than the time I actually leave the curlers in my hair.  This is the Best curler set I have EVER used.  If I was to ask for one change, it would be a quicker warm up time.  However, just the fact that rolling is so quick and easy, makes up for the few extra minutes of preparation.  I'm hard to please, so my recommendation says alot.  Thanks Remmington (I still don't like your other regular rollers! Ha)
I remember managing to find a drive-in that was showing the first run ECEG; and I remember my girlfriend not saying a word while we watched. She was too kind. In retrospect, it was so totally wrong for the time that one almost has to respect it. I say almost. It was a numbing experience then and the most one can say for it now is: At least the Elvis impersonators will leave it alone. The story is weak, the co-stars are painful, and the soundtrack so bad, the weakest selling record of Elvis' career managed to kill of the Extended Playing record. But , for all that, it is Elvis, and the true beliver will find something in it worth carrying away. Its just best watched alone.
This CD Is garbage. Juvenile should go hang him self after putting out this album. He was alright when he first came out but now he sucks the big one. If I was you dont listen to the retards who tell you "this is a good comeback album" . Instead of wasting you cah on this crap i recommend Welcome Back by Mase. That is a good comeback album. The only thing that makes the album even worth noting is the beats of Mannie Fresh. Juvenile just was a waste of those excellent beats. A shame they couldn't go to Ja rule, whose CD sucked with his beats. He has the vocal and writing talent but his beats blow
This is worthless and they say it's refundable, until you read the fine print and realize it's only if you bought the entire product line. It is crap and doesn't do anything. Don't waste your money, drink milk and your hair will grow. This does not work
I love these jeans -- I have 3 pair and they are the only jeans I wear.  Just enough stretch to be comfy but not too tight.  I wear a size 14 and these jeans fit me great. 
Please don't expect to get the cash back from this purchase as promised!  To date, I've been denied twice.  The second time they said the U P C number was invalid. Only, it's the original U P C barcode!  I was meticulous filing the paperwork, yet they state, "All required products were not submitted."  Meanwhile, I have phoned AMAZ0N to lodge a formal complaint. ---  --- The product itself is average.  I've used better and worse.  That said, it's definitely not worth the full asking price
I find this product, easy to implement, train users, and monitor,manage any small business
I love this show.  It is well-written, superbly cast and always fun to watch.  I highly recommend!
Its kind of hard to deny what Krs-One has brought to the game. His flow is phenomenal and the insight he gives is precious even now. Standout Tracks: DUCK DOWN, RUFF RUFF(dope match up with Freddie Foxx), 13 AND GOOD(the story of a guy who sleeps with a teen that calls her father who is a gay cop will have you in stitches), POISONOUS PRODUCTS, QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS, LIKE A THROTTLE, WE IN HERE, THE REAL HOLY PLACE(the deepest track on here), WHO ARE THE PIMPS? and the reggae tinged joints like SAY GAL and SEX AND VIOLENCE are gems also. Filler: NONE! Bottom Line: BDP's six album is still a classic with a message that still isnt heeded till this day. Besides the slammin production, Krs showed that he was 100 steps ahead from the average rapper with this album. Any born again hip hop head would do well to start off with Edutainment and work their way down to this album.
This puzzle (also known as Rubik's Revenge) is good fun - and because it has another layer of movement, it is much more likely to fall apart than the 3x3x3 cube. However, the puzzle of reassembly is also quite fun - and requires no force! A clue to reassembly - make sure that the last two pieces are the same colour edge pieces - and they will (very gently) snap into place.  A second clue: only the centre pieces (four flats pieces on each side) fit into the grooves of the ball - be gentle, and your cube will be as good as new. Start with the four centre pieces of one colour at the bottom - and build up the cube layer by layer. Remember! No force
This is a great product.  It actually fits into my ear properly and I can hear clearly through it.  It is easy to operate and the charge last for many days.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for an earpiece that fits comfortably and is just the right size
This may work well, but the cuff size is not as it is in the description. It says this will work on an arm circumference of up to 18 inches. Not even close. My arm is a little under 13 inches and was too large for the cuff by far. Sure, you can get the cuff to go around your arm, but there are indications on the cuff that have to line up for it to work properly, and there was just no way to even come close
Juliette Binoche is an amazing actress.  Since her Best Supporting Actress Oscar for "The English Patient" in 1996 and her nomination for "Chocolat," she's an actress whose films I seek.  "The Widow of Saint-Pierre" has a bit of irony to the title.  The opening frames show Binoche in black staring out of a window.  We then move into the flashback in which most of the film moves forward.  We learn that the "widow" is the guillotine that must be shipped by boat from France before the big execution can take place.  We see director Emir Kusturica in an acting role as the very large prisoner Neel whose rehabilitation Binoche's Madame La seeks.  We keep wondering if the black dress is saved for the prisoner.  Daniel Autereil who won a Cesar (French Oscar) for his work with director Patrice Leconte for "Ridicule" in 1996 plays the lovestruck Captain who is in charge of the execution.  Spurred on by his wild and unconditional love for his wife, he thwarts the town's sentence of death at every turn, refusing to allow his soldiers to help haul the widow ship to shore.  In the moment of ultimate irony, Neel volunteers to help bring the widow to shore, which is sure to result in his own execution.  The bloody resolution and the final shots of Binoche in black bring the story to its somber conclusion.  Patrice Leconte has a great reserve, shooting this excellent screenplay in period costume and letting the depth of his cast work its magic.  This is an incredibly tragic romance, one that works exquisitely.  Enjoy! 
The size is good but the second one we ordered leaked. The cap did not fit... The after taste is not so strong but very difficult to see the difference from an ordinary stainless steel container/warmer which costs only $6-$10 dollars in the market around. Too pricy and the thin plastic cap does not match well with the product
I write with Noodler's Black (the brand's "standard" black ink) almost every day because I can't always choose the paper to write on. Noodler's Black can be used for two-sided writing on bad paper, even newsprint, which is rare among all the fountain pen inks in the world. ---  --- I also write with Noodler's Black because it's waterproof, forgery-proof, good-looking, and pleasantly smooth during writing. I confidently write checks with Noodler's Black, and it is safe for signing valuable or important documents too (when black is an acceptable color; ask your lawyer). ---  --- Please keep in mind that the Noodler's company carefully says which of the brand's colors are waterproof and which are not. In my experience Noodler's Black is by far the best Noodler's color for writing on both sides of bad paper. ---  --- One behavior you might notice, if your pen's nib is an exposed metal surface (not covered with colored enamel), is that Noodler's (standard) Black spreads itself over exposed metal surfaces. This "nib creep" is harmless behavior because the ink doesn't run down onto the grip area. Wiping the ink off the nib is only temporary; more ink will soon spread to replace what you wiped off. Again, this is harmless behavior and a very small price to pay for the security of your marks, signatures and important handwritten texts
The shoes have sparkles all over and don't serve my purpose. I ordered them to use them for work but returned them because of the sparkle. A nice shoe to use during the night
The cherries are listed as "natural" on the packaging.  There is NOTHING natural about high fructose corn syrup.  I am returning them. --- 
These DO taste almost like the biscuits at Red Lobster.  They are so easy to make and so delicious! I have a muffin maker and they cook perfectly in about  10 minutes
If your toes get hot it has a zipper for that. (useless)  Better off getting a rectangular if you need more legroom.   ---  --- Its small (Even the long one)for a big guy.   ---  --- I wouldnt use it for anything but the summer (and you will most definatly need a good pad
I bought this from another retailer on "black Friday" for half of what Amazon is selling it for and I'm still bringing it back.  I think it's horrible.  I was so excited to get a mini-dv camcorder because I heard how great the picture was, but this takes horrible video. It comes out so dark that you can hardly see anything, even using the light.  Even in a fairly well-lit room it came out dark.  It looked Ok on the lcd screen, but when I hooked it up to the TV, horrible!  And it's not my TV either because I hooked up my old camcorder and it looked fine.  I love that it's so small, but if I can't see the video, it's no use to me.  Back to by big old Sony
I purchased this item as a gift for my son. He seems to think of them a very good gift and helps him to save his finger while he learns how to play the guitar
Okay, for all those who are fans of the Orwell classic, you have to understand how difficult this tale is to bring to the big or small screen.  We're dealing with talking animals relating to humans.  This tale is too deep for the "movie public" and ANY movie will fall short for true purists. ---  --- Taking it for what it is, it is an accurate depiction of the novel.  The reviewer who didn't see Moses the Raven in the story must have watched a different film. ---  --- It is really difficult to get people today to feel the horror of what Animal Farm represented when originally written.  Take that and put it under the Hallmark label and it can be just plain confusing for those who haven't read the novel. ---  --- I truly enjoyed this film.  I reccomend it for all.  Even if it is a little difficult to follow.  Unlike the box says, it is NOT for children
We all know how great the songs are on this CD -- 5-Star all the way. ---  --- However, I guess there's an unlucky few oddballs among us who can't play the SACD hybrid CD format of this particular reissue on our PC.  Which also means that we can't add the CD to our iTunes or iPod music selections.  In this day and age, that's severely limiting, so I regret this purchase (I don't have some jalopy of a PC/processor either, as my computer is less than seven months old, with 2GB of RAM). ---  --- I don't know who to blame for my "mistake" -- myself?  Amazon?  Sony?  Philips?  ABKCO? ---  --- I'll blame myself and be more careful next time -- in part by avoiding "DSD-" or "SACD-" labeled items. ---  --- I'll also give the CD 1 Star on the basis of its limited technological usefulness to me
If you're going to get the Baby Bjorn potty chair, you've got to get a matching stool!  I love how the stool has a rubbery-grip top to prevent slipping.  My son also uses the stool to read his books on while sitting in his matching potty chair.  You've gotta get one now
I rented this game before I bought and liked it so much I just had too buy it
I purchased my Leki Nordic Walking Poles because I read somewhere that these poles would reduce stress on my hips and knees while walking.  That is totally true!  I have a congenital malformation in my right hip which prevents me from ever being able to run or jog as a means for exercise.  I do love to walk, but was hindered by the pain from my right hip.  By using the walking poles, I am able to walk quickly without any pain at all, even though I am actually using more muscle groups than I would if walking without the use of poles.  Walking alone, a person only uses about 50% of the large muscle groups.  Walking with LEKI Nordic Walking poles, one will use up to 90% of all the large muscle groups; this turns a simple 30 minute walk into a full-body workout without stress!!  I would not walk any other way now that I own my LEKI poles!
I specifically bought Turbo Tax Premier because of stocks sales/purchases we made in 2006.  The section on stock income was confusing and it took me several times to figure out what information Turbo Tax wanted where.  When I thought I had it figured out and finished that section, I thought I would repeat it to make sure I did it right.  To my surprise, the second time I entered the information I received a different total than the first time.  So I did it a third time.  The third time matched the second, so I figured it must be right.  Then when I got to the section for error checking, I was told I had errors in my stock sales.  So I did it a forth time, which came out the same as the second and third time.  This time it passed the error checking, but instead of showing that we had purchased the stocks, Turbo Tax showed we had "inherited" the stocks.  I could not get Turbo Tax to change, so I printed out the form scratched out "inherited" and put in the date of purchase.  I would rather do my taxes by hand than use Turbo Tax again
Last year, I purchased the 5600 as an upgrade from my Nikon 2100. I am extremely upset over this purchase I have made, since it does not seem to take any good indoor pictures. The Nikon 2100 takes much better shots inside.  The indoor pics from this camera have an awkward yellow tint, and does not focus well. However, the outdoor shots are very clear and sharp. I tend to use this camera for all my outdoor pictures. The outdoor video works well on this camera too. I am giving this low one-star rating, since many events tend to be held indoors. This was definitely my final Nikon purchase ever
I bought this along with the butterfly pendant and 18" chain for a Christmas gift (06) for my god-daughter and she loves them both.  I loved the price!  The earrings are a perfect fit with the necklace.  She says she only wears them to church and special occasions.  A great gift for teenage girls
Do you have a birthday, anniversary, or other memorable occassion that is drawing near? If you do and you still haven't found that special someone a gift for the Gods, consider ripened ovaries. With their green hues and textured bodies, these ovaries should be at the top of everyone's gift list
I haven't finished this game, though I'm quite close to it. I have to say that this game is quite possibly the most fun that I've had in a long time. I laughed out loud more than a few times, was nearly constantly smiling, and was thoroughly amused with all the little details. Not much stylus action, but then again... did you really expect there to be?  ---  --- My boyfriend's highly considering getting a DS Lite simply so he can play this game.
The children in our after school program love this puzzle.  The colors are beautiful and they are learning about different sea creatures at the same time
What a disaster. Stay away from this film. I was so disappointed--how could this have won the Academy Award?! The story is rambling and confused, as if the filmmakers couldn't decide what story they wanted to tell. The animation is very average, with the exception of a few striking scenes of natural landscapes. In fact, those all-important "happy feet" of the main character just kind of jerk and slide around a bit. (That's supposed to be tap-dancing? that's supposed to be "animation?") The jokes aren't particularly funny (with the exception of a few moments in the middle where Robin Williams briefly shines). And oddly enough for a film whose central conceit centers on music and dancing, there's not a single original song, or even an inspired remake of any of the songs. Think "Billy Elliot" meets "The March of the Penguins" with some  of Gore's "An Inconvenient Truth" mixed in--without any of the wit, charm, intelligence, passion, or beauty in any of those films. (Did I mention that this film is a disaster?) ---  --- Perhaps most annoyingly, like the rest of the story, the underlying political message alternates between cliched, confused, and heavy-handed. The ending is especially unbearable, with its tacked-on feel and absurd psuedo-environmentalist feel-good solution. What a joke! Personally, I consider myself quite liberal and sympathetic to environmentalist positions (I've been a vegetarian for more than 20 years, and a member of Sierra Club and PETA, for example), yet the way this movie presents its misguided message offended me greatly--not least because of the utter inconsistency and incomprehensibility of the message. ---  --- One final note for those of you with children: this is not really a kids movie. Most of the jokes won't be understood by children under 15. For kids under 6, all this feeble film offers is some too-scary "Shamus" (orcas), a terrifyingly ferocious sea lion inexplicably made to growl like a dinosaur and given outsized teeth in a deformed mouth, and a jarring ending that suddenly switches to live-action scenes where adults heatedly debate environmental action in such kid-friendly forums as the United Nations! (What the heck?!) After sitting through the entire film to this point, my four-year-old son finally turned to me and quietly said, "This is not a movie for me."  I couldn't have agreed more
I ordered these for my husband for Christmas and he LOVES them, he says that they are better than any that they have at his gym.  Very durable and only moderately padded, great for the price
Mine is dry sensitive skin and the cream works well. I like the way this cream gives instant glow
It's great to have the option to enjoy Drake's even on Weight Watchers.  Each package is only 4 Weight Watcher points and they still taste like Drake's! ---  --- Yum
It is ironic that you would send this to me.  I can not tell you how excited I was to purchase these slippers.  I had bought everyone in my family UGG slippers for Christmas.  Everyone had cozy slippers but me.....SO instead of paying over $60 I found this pair of Warmbat on amazon.  I researched the brand and thought they may be a good match.  I received the slippers as amazon promised in a timely manner.  The next day the right slipper fell apart the stitching and the bottom of slipper fell off.  I was upset and sewed them, and glued them.  The following week the left slipper fell apart.  I did not want to go thru the process of shipping back the slippers, they were $29.00. SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO disappointed.  Please forward to WARMBAT
If you want a simple to use program to manage personal finances Quicken is for you. I have found it very useful for keeping track of my checking and savings accounts. You can also make automatic posts to your accounts. Which is nice feature if you use automatic online bill pay with your bank. The program makes charts, graphs and reports showing where your money is going and coming from. It also does a nice job showing you if where you are meeting your budget and where you are spending too much money. Quicken makes keeps track of loans easy. It calculates how much money is going to interest and principle. I have been having a hard time and have been unsuccessful at setting up the program to track my 403B account. Overall, I think Quicken is a good program and recommend it to anyone to anyone who does not have a similar product already
Yeah, Johnny must've been drinking heavily during this recording. It's evident in his slurred lyrics...It's Raining is the song where he sounds totally wasted, although you can get the sense that he is infact quite happy and very relaxed. BUT  all this inebriation actually adds to the authenticity of this c.d.---- Johnny Winter really becomes the archetypal BLUESMAN on this c.d.  His guitar work is quite sparse, no long solos on this one but, nevertheless, the feel on this album is wonderful.   I have to say this also..Johnny must've been VERY, VERY brave to release this album back in 1977. That was a very bad year for the blues, appalling infact...disco music was king. Alot of bluesmen, like Johnny Guitar Watson etc were opting for the commercialism of the disco dance floor. Johnny might've thought of releasing a commercial type rock album , like Edgar was doing. Instead he chose to stay faithful to the blues and I have to admire the determination and resolve of Johnny Winter. Very few would've stayed faithful to the blues. ---  The last track with Muddy Waters ..Walking Thru The Park...captures Johnny in his element. He was SO happy back then and it filters over into the song itself. I remember seeing them both do this song live at the Capitol Radio Festival, Alexander Palace, London/England in July 1977. Never again to be repeated, sadly
This appears to be a good piece of equipment. I hav'nt had any major outages as of yet but a minor fluctuation was handled very well.
Everyone in my family (from 3 to 64 years old) loves these organic cookies.  I purchased these cookies at several local stores before I discovered that Amazon had them. I sent a package to my grandson who is in the Army in Iraq and he raved about them.  Newman's has another big winner!
Too loud and the water evaporates way too quickly. I feel like I'm constantly filling the container w/ water. Though my son is a sound sleeper, it is difficult to hear him through the baby monitor b/c of the loudness of the humidificr. I would not buy this item
This high chair is so easy to put together and use.  My grand-daughter loves this chair, the music and toys on top occupy her.  I like how it changes height and reclines.  My grand-daughter was using this chair when she was 3 months.  The recline position came in handy!  I would buy this chair again and highly recommend it to friends and family
This is a great Barney musical songbook, and can also be used as a play piano.  It's great that it has an auto turn off, after non-use.  However, if it is turned off, and something touches it, it automatically turns on by itself.  Many times, after the kids went to bed, and we happen to put something on top of the Barney Sing 'n Play Songbook, it turns on by itself.  Because the Songbook does not have a physical turn off switch, and something touches it, Barney will start talking in the silent room when the kids are asleep.  Just wish it has an on/off switch, so it will not be turned on accidentally.  Otherwise, my 3 year old loves it
Just be sure to read up on this closely... it's not the orchestra you hear in the movie, and you may be especially disappointed when you hear the vocal tracts - gone are great talents Enya and Annie Lennox, replaced by no-name voices.  This is not BAD music, but don't think you're a genius for capturing the music of the movies on one inexpensive 2-CD set
I bought this to transfer LPs to CD. It is simple to connect to the computer, and the software is easy to use. Just be sure when you download  the MP3 encoding program,  to put it in the same directory as the LP ripper. --- The LP recorder works  well and is very easy to use. The LP Ripper, makes it easy to trim the tracks, and then encode them as MP3 files.  --- When saving them as MP3's I can get approximately 20 LP's on one CD. --- I am very satisfied with the product
I got a back of Pico Balla in Germany a couple of years ago and keep coming back to it! Good stuff. Haribo is the gold-standard for gummi candy and this particular type is really good
I had to return this item because the shoes where too big but other than that everything else was ok with the products I received
Downloading objects from fan sites can be hit or miss -- I have had many collections I've downloaded work incorrectly or not work at all in the next expansion pack, and items I really liked were suddenly unavailable.  So, I was looking forward to a "Stuff" pack from Maxis. ---  --- Bah.  Yes, there are several very nice items, but really, this is an underwhelming collection on the whole.  Items are very limited and the collections are small.  The pictures you see on the cover are a good portion of what is contained.  Like so many here remarked, the money spent is not equal to the value received.  Another reviewer pointed out what the title "Glamour Life" implies -- jewelry, house items, luxurious textures for floors and walls, and clothing for all ages, and most of all, excess and abundance.  There's no abundance here.  I've found items I like, but I am not impressed with the collection. ---  --- Maxis knows that its target audience is always hungry for new items, and I think it is taking advantage of the fact, fooling us into thinking we are getting much more than we actually recieve for our money.  I feel a little cheated.  If you must have this, wait until the price drops, or -- better yet -- find a good, reputable fan site  (there are some very good ones out there that have safe downloads) and download for a small fee or for free
Good scent, but it doesn't last more than a week
This sequel to a horror classic started out ok, but by the middle, none of it mattered anymore, I even got a bit tired of the well done gore effects because I had to sit through scenes of a severed [...] and rat duking it out! The original "ReAnimator" is a great flick to see if you want excellent and original gore effects as well as a creepy storyline, but this sequel just stinks
Her favorite toy... she loves the microphone... keys light up to prompt her to press the keys and play a song.... this thing is great
I ordered this for fun and have since decided that it's definitely not for me in any way. It's very drying on my skin, even though it's thick and creamy. The label says it's award-winning, but doesn't state what award it's received (if any!). I fail to see what might warrant it being award-winning. The scent smells like plastic or cheap strawberry candy. Also, it's absurdly priced given the quality. I've tried a few Philosophy items and need to just stop buying them because I'm always disappointed.
I read Bill Bryson's "A Walk in the Woods" and laughed hysterically at many parts of the book, and through the rest was either duly entertained or pleasantly educated (for the "educated" aspect, Bill interlaces the book with fascinating factual tangents). ---  --- I started into "In a Sunburned Country" with similar expectations, and especially since I have always longed and planned to visit Australia.  To state that I was disappointed is a severe understatement.  After reading this book I now have little to no desire to visit the "land down under;" my only hope is that I will completely forget what I read in Bryson's book so that I may one day look forward to and enjoy visiting Australia.  (Senility be merciful and consume me hastily!) ---  --- My best estimate is that Bryson was commissioned to write a ~350 page book about Australia.  During and / or after his trip, his creative sense must have taken a vacation of its own.  I have rarely struggled so much to get through a book as I did with this one.  Bryson even stooped so low as to use an urban legend as a "story" relayed second-hand from one of the Australians he "met."  Such a stunt makes me question if any of his accounts are real in any of his books. ---  --- The only saving grace to this book was the educational tangents.  These, at least, provided for some interesting reading. ---  --- After comparing notes with another person who ventured to read another of Bryson's books ("I'm A Stranger Here Myself") after she read "A Walk in the Woods," it would appear that "In a Sunburned Country" is not the only snore-fest that Bryson has churned out.  Perhaps he isn't a "one hit wonder," but I for one am not going to waste my time or money finding out. ---  --- So, if you are looking for the same caliber of writing that Bryson provided in "A Walk in the Woods," look to another author or prepare to be greatly disappointed. 
This is a gorgeous and "delicate" looking watch. I can read it without my glasses and so far it works. I've had trouble with Timex in the past, so I hope this holds up well. It is very pretty and can go with casual or a nice dress in the evening
I use this for tailgating primarily. It is great because it's cooking size much bigger than it's counterparts. It holds temps well and cooks evenly like all webers do.  ---  --- It's a bit bigger than the smaller smokey joe, but does a nicer job because of it's size.  ---  --- I use it often and will continue to do so. Too bad it is being discontinued.
**1/2 ---  --- When it was released in 1967, "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner" was acclaimed as a "breakthrough" film for its lighthearted, yet serious, depiction of an interracial romance.  In the years since, society has moved so far in the direction of acceptance of so-called "mixed marriages" that any remake is bound to feel, at least to some extent, superfluous and anachronistic.  And that is exactly the case with "Guess Who," a 2005 update whose abbreviated title is only the first of the many changes the filmmakers have rung on the Stanley Kramer original. ---  --- The screenwriters' first alteration involves switching the race roles, so that it is now a black family having to accept a white male as a prospective in-law rather than the other way around.  Bernie Mac assumes the Spencer Tracy role as the father whose world is turned upside down when his beloved daughter brings a Caucasian boyfriend (Ashton Kutcher as a white Sidney Poitier) home to meet the family.  On the distaff side, we have Judith Scott taking over for Katherine Hepburn as the understanding mother and Zoe Saldana replacing Katherine Houghton as the freethinking daughter. ---  --- Since interracial marriage is no longer the hot-button issue it once was, the filmmakers have been forced to inject a number of other non-race-related plot complications into the mix to develop and maintain the conflict and drama.  Thus, we have Kutcher trying to hide the fact from both his fiance and her family that he has recently quit his high-paying job at a prestigious firm and that he may, in fact, be the target of a securities-and-exchange commission probe.  Indeed, with Kutcher spending most of his time trying to win over his critical and overbearing future father-in-law, "Guess Who" feels more like a remake of "Meet the Parents" than of "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner." ---  --- The real problem with "Guess Who" is that it rarely has the courage of its convictions.  Having decided to tackle a relatively dicey topic, the film too often drops the issue in favor of scenes that wouldn't pass muster even on a third-rate sitcom.  For every scene that is incisive and daring - i.e. Kutcher telling a series of black jokes at the family dinner table - there is another that is pure Hollywood hokum (Mac and Kutcher sleeping in the same bed together, Mac and Kutcher having a go-cart race to determine who has the higher testosterone level and the greater machismo, etc.).   ---  --- All of the performers are fine, especially Mac and Kutcher in the lead roles.  However, they just haven`t been given very sophisticated material to work with here.  "Guess Who" might have been a better film had it aimed more for genuine, hard-edged satire and less for lowbrow slapstick and predictable romantic comedy sentimentality.   ---  --- Still, it's been 38 years since "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner" first shocked the nation with its in-your-face defiance of miscegenation laws, and the world has since moved on to other issues of social injustice and marital definition.  Which is why, in the year 2005, "Brokeback Mountain" was a breakthrough film and "Guess Who" was not
This is the stuff that rap dreams are made of!  Just like the movie itself,  this CD is packed with moment after moment of perpetual rollercoaster type thrills that leaves the listener in a sheer state of funk frenzy!  The talent assmbled here is tops and just seems to keep coming at you so,  get in, sit down, buckle up and shut the Fk up because it's about to get rowdy up in here!      
I just got this perfume for Valentine's Day.  I love it!  Yes, it is sweet smelling, as another reviewer mentions, but it's a pleasant sweetness.  Cotton candy does describe it, actually.  But who says grownups don't like smelling yummy??  There's a hint of vanilla as well and overall, I think the combo is fantastic! ---  --- I love Curious, and now I love Fantasy, too!  They are two very different perfumes, so it's easy to understand why a person can like one and not the other.  I will say, though, that Fantasy lasts far longer than Curious.  You can apply it in the morning and still smell it when you go to sleep!  Which, I don't mind at all... ---  --- I recommend this, of course, but I recommend you sample it before you buy.  Just because you liked Curious doesn't mean you will like this one
I bought my Canon A95 in November 2004.  A little after 1 year just after the manufacturer's warranty expired, the infamous E18 error struck.  I called the factory repair center to get a repair estimate, and they quoted $89 plus $8 shipping & handling.  I bought the camera for $300 online, now it's going to cost me roughly 1/3 of its purchase cost to repair it.  For all I know, it might break down again after the repair! The repair comes with 90-Day warranty period, but it COULD break again after 90 days.   ---  --- And then...  --- There is an upgrade option.  Canon offers a program where you can upgrade A95 for A610 for $125 plus $10 shipping and handling.  This comes with only 6-month warranty.  Again, it COULD be flawed with the same e18 error that could struck after warranty expires.   ---  --- I would really do extensive research before buying another CANON.
It only became clear to me how MS undermines Mac by using its software as weapon when I began using MS office for Mac. I have used Window's based Excel everyday at work for the last 20 years and I cannot figure out how to use the Mac version efficiently. It seems like an ersatz version from 15 years ago. If you want to work on PowerPoint docs at home created on your PC at work you will find the effort not worth it...the docs will never transfer formatting properly. I bought this program and almost never use it because it is just so clumsy compared to the PC version. Having said that, there is no alternative to MS office; this is the outcome of MS having monopoly power...no support and an inferior product for Mac user
This game is in such a sorry state that I don't even know where to begin. ---  --- First of all, this is not at all what I expected and what I wanted. Sid is known for very complex simulations and I preordered this game only because I saw his name as the game designer. Alas, the game is the most dumbed down train simulation I had ever seen. Looks like Sid jumped in the "easy, fast and easy" bandwagon. ---  --- Second, the game is, at best, barely out of beta - a little more useful and less destructive than, say, a computer virus. I experience frequent crashes and the AI often builds ridiculous tracks. ---  --- Finally, be aware that the game has one of the worst copy protection systems I had ever seen, which interferes with other applications. For instance, the game won't launch while I run Skype. ---  --- Selling a game in such an unfinished state shows lack of ethics and disrespect for the customer. Shame on you, Firaxis and Sid Meier.
I ordered the loose tea in tins and received 6 boxes of tea bags. The only labeling on the box was a barcode sticker with for tea in tins, which was incorrect. When calling customer service I had only two options -- return the tea bags or keep them and be overcharged. There was no follow up, so there was no way to know if I would receive the correct product if I ordered again. The price had gone up 20% in the mean time. Rather than be without tea (I can't buy that brand where I live), I kept it. You can't get your money back if you are over charged, and you can't complain about it to anyone who cares. I will never use Amazon Grocery again if I can help it, and I suggest you do the same.
Meet Me in St. Louis takes a war-torn America back to a simpler time, a time when telephones were new and everyone was talking about the World's Fair. The Smith family is very close, and although each of them have their problems, they share their lives with each other. Esther (Judy Garland) has a crush on "The Boy Next Door," and sings a beautiful song about him. Rose (Lucille Bremer) hopes to be proposed to, even if it is over the telephone. Tootie (Margaret O'Brien) has a fascination with death and a wants to be included with the older kids. Everyone's lives are changed, however, when they hear that their father is going to move everyone to New York for his job. ---  --- There are plenty of great songs here, and although many of them sound like show-tunes, they enhance the film quite well. Aside from "The Boy Next Door," we have the famous "Trolley Song," as well as the now-classic "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" and a fun number called "Under the Bamboo Tree." Of course, the main title song "Meet Me in St. Louis" is run throughout the film.   ---  --- You might think the story is rather silly and unrealistic, but it is actually based on the memoirs of the woman that Tootie's character is based on. One can learn all about it and other behind the scenes stories like about the romance that developed between Garland and her director Vincente Minelli in the documentary also included on this VHS
Not bad, however, in Version 10, was able to use CNTRL + to zoom in.  Used the + on the number pad -- now this function doesn't work, and the only + that works is that in the top row of the keyboard.  The zoom out "-" in the number pad still works, but not the plus.  I say that's not good. ---  --- Why ruin things with an upgrade
Collateral Damage is the great and partially real action film in which  Arnold Schwarzenger plays a fireman hell bent on getting his hands on the Terrorist who killed his wife and kid and many other citizens near a shopping mall.  ---  --- With the attacks on Sept 11 , movies have tried to cash in but Collateral Damage is different. Arnold even dedicated the movie to firefighters everywhere in an interview  with Byron Allen.  ---  ---  --- The movie is brilliant in showing what only what the motivation behind terrorist attacks , but the depiction of slow agencies like fbi to counter these terrorist attacks.  ---  --- Basically, the FBI and CIA tell Gorden Brewer(Arnold Schwarzennger) that they are working to bring down the terrorist who killed his family, when in fact they  have no good leads on the suspect.  ---  --- Rather, than sitting on his butt, and waiting for the FBI to do something, Gordon takes the law into his own hands and seeks to get justice for his family  by going into Columbia and getting ''The Wolf''(Cliff Curtis) as the terrorist is called.  ---  --- There is a great scene in which Gordon goes crazy and literally beats the hell out of a cold-blooded radio news reporter who says that the victims are pure garbage by saying their ''collateral damage''. The radio reporter explains the reasons behind terrorist attacks but shows no feeling for victims. I loved this scene, because this reporter clearly has no remorse for the dead. He probably has no family of his own, and doesn't know the meaning of life, except to cover his own.  ---  --- Now you might say to yourself what's the difference between Arnold's character (who is going for justice) and the terrorist well here is the big difference from  Arnold himself: ''The difference between me and you is that I am only going to kill you''.  ---  --- Unbelievable action and twists at the end, that you're literally be on the edge of youre seat, and just when you think the movie is over.... it's  not !!!  ---  --- Director Andrew Davis not only gives a fact type based movie based on Columbia, but also a factual based type movie that deals with Terrorism and the lessons that we must learn to see that things like this don't happen again.  --- In fact, most people will remember the horrible case of Wall Street Reporter , Daniel Pearl, who was executed after the U.S. failed to meet the demands of the Middle East terrorist holding.  ---  --- The U.S. should have gone after these terrorists like the way Arnold does in this movie. but then the U.S. does not have a great track record when it comes to nailing terrorist even going back to the 1970's the U.S. supported and backed up --- madmen like General Pinochet in Chile and dictator Samoza in Nicaragua. Both of them killed hundreds of people with U.S. backing and funding. ---  --- Still though ''Collateral Damage'' is a great action film that you must see.
I bought these boots just in time before the crazy weather started.  Let me tell you,these boots are great!!!!!!  I read all the reviews and bought them a half size bigger and now they're a little big, regardless, I love them and another thing, they keep my feet very warm and cozy
This magazine has beautiful pictures, heartwarming stories and as a bonus, a laugh or two.  It covers the countryside of all of the United States and reminds you of a slower, more genteel time.  It makes you want to plan a trip to view the scenery for yourself.  If you long for life outside of the city, you'll enjoy this obvious labor of love
I was a little surprised.  I'm not a huge fan of packaged rice or noodle dishes, but sometimes I need to throw together something quickly.  I was intrigued by the list of ingredients, and decided to give Fox River Rice Creole a try.  I'm glad I did!  This is seriously good stuff -- lots of flavor, easy to prepare, etc.  Best of all, it's not overly salty, one of my pet peeves with packaged food.  It's great as a side dish, but I think it would also be wonderful with a little dded sausage (maybe some andouille).  I'll definitely be purchasing this again
I saw this movie twice, the second time knowing exactly why I wanted to see it again. If you are trying to find out if you love someone or not, make sure that you see this movie. Such a simple but yet such a powerful definition of love it gives. Explains why we are where we are, and makes you part of the harmony. Is love as simple as teaching someone to bike? Think about it.  ---  --- If there are no rules against it, this film should be renominated for Oscar.
When my daughter was born, I didn't know about swaddling, and it would take me HOURS to get her to sleep! I would feed or rock her in my arms until she falls asleep, then put her in her crib... and she'd flail her arms, wake up and cry, and I had to start all over! What a nightmare!  ---  --- Then I figured out that since her arms wake her, it would make sense to wrap her in something so she couldn't move them as much... so I started wrapping her in regular receiving blankets. It worked! It became much easier to get her to sleep. But then she wiggled out of those receiving blankets and wake up again.  ---  --- When she was a little over a month old, somehow I came across SwaddleMe blankets on the Internet and immediately bought it. It worked great! It was so easy to wrap my daughter in it, and it stayed put. My daughter started sleeping so much better!  ---  --- I wish I found those blankets sooner - it would've saved me from so many sleepless nights!  ---  --- 2 years later, my son was born, and thankfully I already knew about those blankets from the start. He goes to sleep great in the SwaddleMe blanket! Out of curiosity, I tried to put him to sleep without this blanket, and his arms wake him right away - exactly the same as my daughter!  ---  --- I consider this blanket one of the most important baby items you could buy. It should be a must for a new mother who wants to get some sleep
I travel a lot, especially to Europe, and hate taking lots of cables with me for the Vonage, router, laptop, cellphone and crackberry. The iJuice unit looked like a good idea. ---  --- HOWEVER, the unit just failed during my trip, leaving me stranded and badly caught out with no back-up.  BAD IDEA ---  --- A friend switched me on to charging everything via USB.  I just bought a cheap $5.00 USB charger for the Nokia, the crackberry charges via USB anyway, so I just needed to buy an ordinary laptop 110/240v adaptor  and I was all set. Laptop and nokia phone all charging away at the same time. ---  --- Single point of failure is the laptop. However, Apple does a great universal adaptor (you can get UK./US etc plugs) with USB for charging Ipods for $20, all in one neat unit. You can just stick the USB for the Nokia in the back.  ---  --- Seriously, don't waste your money, unless you use more than one laptop or really need a particular tip you can't charge via USB. Using USB is far lighter, far more reliable, you don't loose the tips.
The movie starts out with our hero, Izo, being gruesomly crucified. Because of his rage towards the ones who crucified him, he travels through time to present day to wreak his vengence on them. Then a bunch of stuff happens that has no relevance to the plot really, including: having sex with mother nature, a woman pulling a sword out of her vagina then izo throwing a rock at her face, being killed several times, a very trippy scene where he is sucked underwater and comes up on the other side of some wedding where he kills the groom and bride then is sucked back, killing little children, killing a group of mothers in the hallway, vampires, being attacked by a swat team, and a random guy singing while playing an out of tune guitar. While he does all this he turns into a demon then finally kills the ones that were responsible for his crucifixion. ---  --- This movie gets 5 stars because it is so random and has made me mentally insane since watching it and other japanese films like it
My girls love the sandbox!  The only thing my husband and I don't like is that you cannot move it once the sand is in it.  We thought we'd be able to, but the walls are just flimsy enough that you can't.  Otherwise, a great purchase
I recently purchased an HP Laptop that, to my regret, came with a pre-load of Win Vista.  Some of the bad things about this package are: ---  --- 1. The help files are all on line.  If I'm not connected to the internet, I can't access the help files. ---  --- 2. HP does ship it's laptops with the Vista install CD's.  Instead, a CD to purchase an upgrade to the next version of Vista is included. ---  --- 3. For the newer laptops, HP is not producing drivers for any other OS except Vista. ---  --- 4. Vista is less user friendly than XP or even 2000. ---  --- 5. And yes, Vista looks familiarly like OS X, but is harder to work with.  I have owned several Apples and looks are deceiving.  Just because it looks like an Apple doesn't mean it works like one. ---  --- 6. All of my instructional software no longer works.  I use a lot of software to teach Information Security that no longer works on Vista, such as: ---   a. CyberCiege (An information security wargame) ---   b. Boson CCNA Network Simulator ---   c. Visual Studio (Not everything works) ---  --- 7. Also, some of the network management tools will not run or run properly on Vista.  I do a lot of remote management from the workstation versus going to the server.  Many of the vendors that provide tools are way behind the power curve on their Vista support. ---  --- I could go on but what's the point?  I can't even dump Vista to go back to Windows XP or even 2000 if HP won't even make an attempt to produce drivers for the laptop.  Linux is out for the same reason, no drivers.  So I'm basically stuck with an overpriced emailer and word processor. ---  --- If you plan on purchasing a computer, make sure that if you plan on dumping the OS and going back to XP or changing to LINUX, the vendor has all of the drivers to support the change is not on the Microsoft Vista Conspiracy bandwagon
I use this along with the 807 BBQ fork for the BBQ and the Smoker. I use the BBQ Fork for grilling and this for smoking and roasting. The lighted digital dial allows me to see the temperature and settings in dim light.The alarm tells me when the desired temperature is reached.The silicone coated probe is very sturdy and has been problem free
great and fast to deal with will do buisness in the futur
This stuff is great.  A fresh alternative to the regular suspects.  Highly recommended to those who like a bit of a kick in their palate
Tempora mutantur, nos et mutamur in illis - The times change, and we change with them... this is a perfect watch and probably you won't change your time machine for a long time...simple and beautifu
This movie is great if you want to go to sleep and you ran out of boring books. Ethan Hawke leans to heavily on Kris Kristofferson's performances not to mention Jeff Tweedy's music. As a matter of fact the only gleaming light in the movie is the music. It is written interestingly enough, but the visuals look like there wasn't enough money in the budget to clean up the cheap video that it was shot on. The best way to watch this movie is in the background. You don't need the visuals, and if you dare watch them you will get dreary eyed and fade away
The locket on this cable chain is so tiny, you will not be able to put a picture in it.  After opening the box and being completely disappointed, I opened the locket to see how it worked.  It would not close properly after opening.  The quality of this necklace is not good - do not waste your money. 
My baby was playing with the giggle ball when one of the caps fell off and all of the beads spilled on the floor.  Please use caution with this toy!  The toy wasn't being played with roughly and the floor was carpeted.  There was no reason for the toy to fall apart
Although this charger is suggested when purchasing the Verizon Razr, the phone complains that this an "Unauthorized Charger" and it will not charge the phone. Do not waste your time with this
Echoing other reviews, performance is not consistant.  One time we did get excellent coffee, this morning it jammed the Senseo machine with a steam lock and there is not telling when we will be able to re-open it.  Considering the price of these pods, even only one bad pod makes it impossible to recommend the product
The wagon is great, as expected.  5 stars for the wagon, no stars for delivery.   ---  --- It arrived with a dent, though, and when we called they told us a replacement wouldn't be available until mid-February, plus we'd have to figure out how to re-pack the thing, which was halfway assembled before we noticed the dent . . . so we gently banged it out and spray-painted the spot, and the recipients probably won't care, but it was a pain-in-the-butt, and there didn't seem any way to deal with it that wouldn't have been too much trouble.
I bought this camera for my 80 year old mother because I knew that if she was going to try digital photography, it had to be EASY ! The printer dock is simple for her to use to transfer snapshots of her cat to her computer and email them to her friends.   I have used the older CX-7300,( very similar camera) for backpacking for years and it has never failed under harsh conditions. The lack of optical zoom is a plus for me; less to break. The C530 is more compact, has better resolution, and still has the option of using AA batteries when the rechargables die. If you want simple digital snapshots, you will love this little camera
I could never expect to like a lemon scented perfume,but this one is definately different. ---  --- When i first smelt it in the bottle i thought:"Oh,no!Dish soap!",but when i put it on i immediately loved it. ---  --- On me it smells like lemon scented candy.It's so fresh and clean!I couldn't stop smelling my wrist!And everytime i smelt it i felt as if i were in a wet garden and lemon blossoms were falling on my skin! ---  --- It was a nice alternative to all my candy scented perfumes. --- It lasts a long time too and it's affordable,plus it smells like spring! ---  --- The best choise to welcome the hot days of the summer,since it will keep you fresh and cool. ---  --- A must buy!
 This album came out about 8 years before I was born. All the years, I still remember turning on the classic radio stations that would play WBSS or Billie Jean. Now I know all the lyrics and music videos from this album. This is MJ in his prime. Unfortunately, we will never get another epic like this again. Michael is sadly a target in the media, but he is still a great music icon whether you like him or not. Every song off here is a classic. One song I thought was unneccesary was "Baby Be Mine". But otherwise, it's excellent. If you starting an MJ collection, get this album first. Trust me.
I was sceptical about buying this product after reading one of the reveiws about having some trouble with Quicktime. Anyways, I had no problems with this program at all. Guitar is my favorite instrument. I've always wanted to learn how to play guitar. I even bought the cheap $10 dollar videos that basically rush through everything and left me frustrated, and playing the chords all wrong. This video is SO MUCH FUN!!!! I thought I could never play guitar after being so discouraged from learning from other videos. I figured, ok, this is a little more expensive, but at least I will learn how to play over 70 songs!!! I'm so happy that I bought this video. It is worth every penny. I'm currently on the 42nd lesson. Mind you, this video is not one of those "we move along quickly, so if you didn't get it, just rewind" videos. Oh no, this video makes you practice the chords many times so it's in your head. When you're done with this video, you'll feel so confindent. It's like having your own private instructor. Certain things I was doing wrong I no longer do. It has even cleaned up my fingering technique. I have no more words, it's a great video and you can't go wrong with Amazon's price. ---  --- Thank you
The volume control on this is totally lame.  I can't get it quite enough to put on the crib for bedtime.  Also, the sound quality is poor in general.  I suppose it's OK for just playing in the room, but definitely not for bed.  You can probably get something with better sound quality for a comprable price
I have this lip gloss in Sweetie and will be trying other shades.  I am very pleased with it!  I wear it over stay-on type lip colors in other brands, and it keeps my color on all day (even after eating)!  It doesn't really feel too sticky if you blot after application.  I only wish it tasted as good as it smells (not that it tastes bad, it's just blah)!     
I have never ordered anything such as this online. I was surprised that the nuts arrived in about half as much time as the site said it would take. I will consider ordering again once I have used these up. The walnuts were so fresh and nice, not all broken up, as some have been when I have purchased them at the grocery store.  
I was browsing through Amazon when I came upon Nvie jewelry and I absolutely love it! I bought this necklace for my mom for her birthday, but had a hard time not keeping it for myself. The necklace was really nice, well constructed, and it was shipped quickly. It looked just like the picture, but I have a feeling that each piece of jewelry is truly one-of-a-kind.I would recommend Nvie Designs to anyone for buying really lovely, affordably priced jewelry. --- 
I in 1996 I bought and read All the Pretty Horses first. Laughed myself off the train seat in to town.  Bought the whole lot and read them in chronological order - re-reading Pretty Horses on the way.  Along with scenes from the Orchard Keeper, Sutree sticks in my mind - images ideas, flavours, jokes, and a personality that I'd rather see more of.  Sutree made me feel that I know this man, and could even like him.  Great fun, and deserves selfish time to read and unwind after reading.
I was so dissapointed with this camera! I purchased a Sony Cybershot 3 years ago and, it had been such a great camera, I automatically thought this newer model would be great. Almost every picture I took was either blurry or the light areas of the picture were blown out! As an experienced Cybershot user, I tried all settings to fix the problem, but no luck. Terrible for capturing a child's first steps, as the description says. Would not recommend
Good, but it simply wasn't actionous enough. I don't mind having no action in a book (otherwise how else could I love Foundation so much?), but Children was a book that NEEDED to have action in it. Unfortunately it didn't really. Too much philosophical babble that I had to re-read to get it. Slightly reminiscent of Card's later Shadow series with the sheer amount of internal monologue. Too much about Jane, not enough about the pequeninos and barely anything about Ender, which annoyed me. To my shock Ender's death did not really impact me in any way, beyond--"Huh? Wait...Ender is dead?", so little was his role in the book. He probably talked for only about twelve pages altogether. ---  --- EDIT: From now on I am never giving a book that I halfway like two stars again because each time, I receive the urge to change my rating to three stars.  Just keep in mind that while it says two, it means three
I purchased this towel warmer for my wife.  She has been very disappointed.  It simply does not get hot enough to heat towels so she has stopped using it.   I would not recommend it to anyone.
I've only just started.  But so far, I am very pleased with this language program.  My only regret is that I don't have enough time to keep at it.  The various learning modalities are quite useful-this is the only program (aside from taking a class) that i've used which does this.  I recommend it
We bought our Floppy Seat when our baby boy was about 6 months old.  Even though he was still a little "floppy" himself when it came to sitting up, the Floppy Seat supported him. He's now 18 months old, and it's still going strong!  Although, now he wears "real" shoes, and the leg openings tend to get caught on then. It took a little practice to get the hang of the threading the belt through the cart, but now it's SO fast!   ---  --- We also use it EVERY time we go out to eat.  As a matter of fact, the one (and ONLY) time we forgot to bring it along, our son started to choke while sitting in a restaurant highchair.  The belt buckle on the old restaurant chair became stuck, and would NOT open, after multiple attempts!  We were forced to turn the whole chair sideways in order to proceed to clear his airway. He was fine, but we were all shaken up! If we'd had our (familiar) floppy Seat cover, we would have been able to help our son a few moments faster. Every second counts!
Camenson definitely has experience in this career with many "career books" to her credit.  However, there are better books out there on writing with more information. This book follows the same old tired format that VGM books are 'not so' famous for.  The internet has more info for a lot less money
This is the worst version of Adobe Illustrator to be released since version 9. Opens files that I've been using for years and then writes scribbled, unopenable 'saved' versions. Crashes. Can't save for mysterious reasons. Writes "version 10" files with text split into pieces. ---  --- Such a fine product! Really glad I paid money for it!! ---  --- I downgraded back to Irritator 10
In this movie we once again see Mad Max (sans hot car) wandering around in a Post Apocalyptic world until he discovers Bartertown in the Wasteland.Mel Gibson tries valiantly  to channel  such on screen loners as Clint Eastwood  and John Wayne but only succeeds in making his character look inarticulate with poor social  skills. However he becomes a threat to the Matriarch of the town by the name of Aunty EmTeeVee (or something like that). Then Mel kicks a lot of butt in the process. This is a dismal tedious movie which is only redeemed by the fact that it was filmed in the Outback Opal Mining Town of Coober Pedy which I visited a few years ago
I recently purchased the anime studio 5 but not the --- pro version, which costs 150 more and gives more functionality. ---  --- This is a fully functioning animation software, with lots of  --- interesting features. I can see no reason that a novice --- animator such as I am would not be happy with this software. ---  --- I would like to see more energy put into a manual, but you  --- can scavenge the anime blog/chat site to find answers, or --- google other places.  With a more robust manual, this would --- be 5 stars, not 4.  It is really the reason I am reluctant --- to upgrade to Pro, because I would want more lessons and --- tutorials to go along with the upgrade.  ---  --- If you have an interest in animating, this is the software  --- for you.  --- 
You've read a lot of reviews to get to this one, most likely, and they've gone on about how great it looks (it does look tremendous), how fantastic the gameplay is (it is awe-inspiring), and how just absolutely great of a gaming experience it is. There are a few things that I would like to add. First off, there is one slight problem with the game. Personally, with action games of the 3rd-person variety, I like to be able to control the camera. This game does not have that. Instead, you are taken where the gamemakers want you to go and only what they want you to see. This is a very slight complaint, and one I'm hoping will be improved with GOD OF WAR II. The second thing that I would like to add is that the Mythological aspect of this game is GREAT! It really gives the game a very epic scale that is not found in a great many games. It's the thing that drives this game farther than it usually would. It's a tremendously entertaining, and oft-times thought-provoking, game that has a sense of gravitas that most action slice'em-dice'em games of this type get to. Get it
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS TOY, THE BATTERY IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR THIS TOY. LEARN FROM MY MISTAKE. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!! no where in the product discription does it tell you that the 9.6 volt battery is NOT INCLUDED, all it says, is that you will have to purchase a 9 volt battery for the remote. Don't look for the Tyco 9.6 volt battery in a store or on line, because it will be "out of stock". I have been trying to purchase one for  4 months
I can't wait to see the original film again. I remember seeing the lemmings plunging into the sea. Thus was born the inspiration for the great PC game, Lemmings. Yes, I know that the lemmings were 'manipulated' into suicide. Nevertheless I love this movie. I hope that they don't cut the lemming sequence. Disney has promised a full restoration. Other animals that left a strong impression on me were the musk oxen in a circle being blasted with an Arctic blizzard. The hardships of an Arctic existence were beautifully photographed
This is an emotionally charged, witty, and brilliantly told drama of four friends struggling to understand marriage, divorce, intamacy, and each other.  One of the best plays I've seen/read
the shoes were in great shape, the shipping speed was fast, really satisfie
This grinder was recommended to me, but I have to say I find it frustrating to use.  Juice leaks out the bottom when grinding steamed vegetables or juicy fruit, and grinding some things (e.g., green beans) takes a lot of force.  While the price is fine, the high cost of "shipping and handling" to purchase one unit made me angry; had I noticed before I bought it, I wouldn't have!  Since then I've noticed that this is sold at most local grocery stores
The product is flimsy, the step is too close to the toilet to be practical for a child to step up on, the deflector is not tall enough to deflect any urine, and the seat is too large for a toddler.  My child does not feel comfortable using this potty
My best friend got this movie at her birthday and i watch it at her house it WAS SO FUNNY!!!!!! Anybody who love SPONGEBOB will LOVE this MOVIE!!!!!!
THIS 1948 15-CHAPTER SERIAL FEATURES SUPERMAN [PLAYED HERE BY THE LATE KIRK ALYN] GOING UP AGAINST A GANG OF CROOKS. THIS IS A HELL OF A LOT BETTER THAN THE 1950S TV SHOW THAT FEATURED GEORGE REEVES! AT LEAST THIS SERIAL WAS FUN TO WATCH AND AT LEAST YOU CAN GET INTO WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS MOVIE. YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO FIND THIS SERIAL IN STORES TODAY, BUT, IF, BY SOME CHANCE, YOU COME ACROSS THIS VIDEO, GET IT!!!!
First off, Robert DeNiro as the monster. I saw him and immediately thought of Jake LaMotta or Vito Corleone. They didn't even try to disguise his accent and no-one ever explains why the monster sounds like he just got off the plane from New York. Second, Kenneth Brannagh was so in love with  the set that he forgot about story. Finally the scene where Elizabeth was ressurected was ridiculous. Frankenstien's shock that she's not happy to be back--burnt up, cut of and her heart pulled out of her chest-- was supposed to be touching but I laughed. We all know how great Kenneth Brannagh is but he got completely carried away here and the result was really, really, really bad.  ---  --- I give it two stars for the pretty costumes and utter magnificence of Aidan Quinn's face.
Great sound. love the volume control on the wire. great fit to almost any head size or shape. Overall a great purchase and I love their product
I'm very pleased with this small unit that has a great deal of power. It's compact, not heavy, has an adjustable power output by simply spinning the wheel on the camera to the left or right. In addition to the light output, the head can be tilted so the light can be direct or bounced, an excellent feature. Getting up and running with this unit was a breeze because I am totally "brochure reading averse."  ---  --- Twenty years ago I was a photographer with big equipment, but had given up both.  I was surprised by the control one has with such a small and relatively inexpensive unit
My son loves this game.  When moving around the tracks, in the one game it can be difficult, the key is if you moving up or down, depending on which direction you need to go, push the joystick the direction once and let go, after that push the joystick the direction the train needs to go. I hope this helps.  My son will be 3 in less then a month and it took him a week to figure out how to move around the tracks.  Mom, dad and sis had to play before that.  The other games are a little easier, but I found the games educational and my son loves it
A friend shared her MarketSpice tea with me years ago, and I was so pleased to run across an old brochure she had given me.  I ordered some, and that wonderful taste was still the same.  The teabags are so fresh and full of flavor that the oils in the tea cling to the clear bag they come in. It's a flavor you won't find anywhere else.  You can taste the orange and the cinnamon, and they're just a little sweet - you may not need to even sweeten yours!
Brush applicator puts it exactly where I want. Gives my lips a great "wet look", without being messy. Never bleeds & lasts for hours without touch-ups. This is the only gloss I'll use
I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PAPER FOR YEARS WITH WONDERFUL RESULTS. MY PRINTED PAGES COME OUT CRISP AND CLEAR.  I HAVE NEVER MADE A HOLE IN THE PAPER USING A PEN OR PENCIL.  I FOLD THIS PAPER ALL THE TIME AND HAVE NEVER HAD IT RIP ON THE FOLD OR ANYWHERE ELSE.  I AM CONFUSED BY THE REVIEWER'S COMMENTS. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT
This battery was no better then the old battery it replaced.  When phone was new, battery life was good. Not sure what is the problem.  Maybe the newly purchased battery is old with no use. Vendor service was good. Or maybe just a bad battery.
Rock Star soap appeals to my playful side and the scent in this soap leaves one a little giddy. The sweet vanilla fragrance is blended with perfumes and the result is something like a spicy vanilla and strawberry milkshake. Can I say yum?  ---  --- This is absolutely delish and I think they may have added a little cinnamon to the mix. I love keeping lush soaps by the sink because they don't seem to dry out my hands as much as gel soaps. This one is perfect in combination with the Smitten hand cream.  ---  --- Rock Star soap left me dreaming about buying other "vanilla" themed items like Think Pink (which I tried), Creamy Candy (a bubble bar), Sympathy for the Skin (which I'm dying to try) and Honey Trap (which I just tossed recklessly into my shopping cart). Candy Fluff sounds like it would go well with this experience. If you love this soaps creamy consistency, Gratuitous Violets, Sultana of Soap and Alkmaar will impress.  ---  --- Any chance the vanilla toothpaste will be listed here soon? Wish, wish... ---  --- ~The Rebecca Review 
The CD came without a CD case and the CD did not play.  I am very disappointed
If you're looking to create the next Doom 3 or Half-Life 2, then I can't really recommend this program. If you want to make an advanced FPS game, or a simple pong game, then I can recommend Dark Basic. In fact, Dark Basic Professional is probably capable of creating any kind of game that you can come up with. The catch? You have to program it yourself, all from scratch. Dark Basic makes manipulating 3D data extremely easy, but it's not a game creation package which lets you click and create. If you are determined enough, it's easy to learn all of Dark Basic's commands, as half of programming a game is in the logic. Dark Basic will hardly limit you, and will give you capabilities that were probably impossibly hard for you to use in C++. The end result of creating a game from scratch results in a tremendous sense of satisfaction, especially when you share it with friends and family. Although previous versions of Dark Basic Professional had some hardly crippling bugs, most of them have been eliminated, and with the release of upgrade 6.0, DBPro is a very stable development engine. Overall, I totally recommend this to anyone who wants to create a game, but is determined enough to learn how
In my opionion, Act! is clearly still the best contact manager on the market. I am not talking about a complex CRM solution, but it is a fine contact manager. I am not using the Outlook and Palm interfaces and I don't have any complains other than it is slow if you are running many programs at the same time. ---  --- The built in email features are okay, seach features are excellent. Just give it a 30 day trial and compare to Goldmine, Maximizer and others
I was very excited that one of My "boys" had bought Me this chair, but when it finally arrived, I was very disppointed. the motors are semi weak, it does NOT feel like 10 motors more like 6 if that. the chair's pic is also very unrealistic in My opinion, the seating it not attached, its a pad, very cheaply made not worth the price at all... I wouldnt pay more then 80.00 for this chair!
I was eager to read this book only to find it a terrible dissapointment.  One would think that a 'scholar' such as he would have at least a basic understanding of the Hebraic roots of Judeo-Christianity.   --- It was obvious that he clearly was clueless to the known Messianic signs spoken of in the Gospels.  He is also clueless to the Pharisidical Judaism of the time..not comprehending that all of Christ's teachings were completely in keeping with true Judaism. All of which can be found in contemporary Rabbinical teachings of His time. This book, which some unfortunate readers will swallow as truth will only continue to propagate a backward understanding of the gospels.   --- Like it or not..the New Testament writings are Hebraic and explain what fulfilled Judaism is.  Those who need to divorce Judaism from Christianity are offering a church which is already confused, just more confusion. It is through studying the Hebraic roots that we even begin to understand the 'difficult' sayings of our Lord; 'fullfillment of the Law', binding and loosing (the Law)..etc as well as the parables.  The delivering of the deaf mute..was a Messianic sign, because the Rabbi's knew that 'they' had to ask the said demon its name but He did not.  Lazerus's resurrection was a Messianic sign because the Rabbi's believed that anyone could come back to life during the first 'three' days after death.  Cleansing of a leper was  Messainic sign because the Rabbi's understood that it was a 'divine' punishment, that only God could lift. How else can we link Isa 53 with the 'stripes' He was to received as part of fulfilling the punishment the Law required for transgression, and yet 'minus one'. Had our Lord transgressed the Law, then the Jews themselves could have legally killed Him.  Remember Paul (Saul)?  He also does not understand John and his huge part in the whole picture, in that the Kingdom 'began' with John.  He was the 'breachmaker' as fortold in prophecy.  This is Hebraic roots 101.   --- People, please study the Hebraic roots of Christianity and do not waste your time with this book. The fact that he keeps defending his position as 'not' anti-semetic, should give you a clue
very cheap, you can tell it's an fake camera miles away. sure it has these features of motion detector which makes it move and has led lights; but not worth 6 dollars at all. stay awa
I was very displeased when I received the Feuilles de Brick. I had to cater for an important client. All the ingredients ready to be  assembled in the Feuilles and due to their dryness (the Feuilles de Brick) I could not bake my desserts
A very enjoyable documentary from the personal perspective of an ex Christian.We need many such documentaries out there to help inform people about the dangers of religion in general. I wish some brave person would do a film about how Christianity came into being from an objective historical perspective. This film touched on the subject, but it was not really the focus of the documentary.Perhaps we will be "blessed" by a further exploration of the subject in the future
I'm sorry...I really, really tried to get into this movie and just couldn't.  It was just plain boring.  Normally I love these types of movies but not this one.  I just kept waiting and waiting for the 'point' or for something to make the last hour and a half of watching it worthwhile.  Never happened.  I would recommend renting this one first just to make sure
This product helps you copy anything on your computer to your nokia phone.I love it to death and use it almost everyday.Eforcity really did a good job shipping it to me and I completely want more bussiness with them
I love this stuff having grown up in Hong Kong, then a British colony, we ate this stuff like water.  It's an acquired taste though if you were not brought up on it. Spread it thin over bread and butter.  Delicious
Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for
I used to have a Graco Metrolite stroller, and I really liked it. However, I gave it to a relative because it went with an infant travel system. I bought a used Jeep Liberty Stroller, thinking it would be an upgrade, and boy was I wrong.  ---  --- I will simply list the things I do not like: --- 1) It is quite bulky when folded, especially compared to other strollers I've had. --- 2) It is heavy, awkward to carry, and there's nowhere apparent to grab it. Handles? I don't see any. --- 3) All 3 tires went flat. My local bike shop charged about $30 to replace them all (your mileage may vary). --- 4) My daughter was not interested in the steering wheel and since the battery that the previous owner left in it had corroded, the sounds didn't work so I can't comment on those. --- 5) It CREAKS when you push it. I'm not sure where the sound is coming from but we oiled the wheels and it still creaks. --- 6) The MP3 player, which is the "cool factor" and the only reason my husband has prevented me from getting rid of the stroller, has these small speakers near the baby's head, so in order to really hear the music if you're playing music YOU like, you have to turn it up. And the volume doesn't go very high. For the same money, you could probably buy some portable powered speakers and clip them to the stroller.
I measured 7 batteries out of the pack of 20 with La Crosse charger, which I also bought from Amazon.  The capacity ranged from 547 mAh to 2002 mAh, with the average being 886 mAh.  That's about a third of the stated capacity.  Before I took the measurements, I made sure the charger works properly by testing it with two different brands of AA NiMH batteries: La Crosse and Energizer.  Both scored very close to their stated capacity.  Therefore, the test is valid and SUNPAK's claim of 2650 mAh is grossly overstated.  ---  --- My advice: avoid SUNPAK like the Plague! ---  --- 
Although this product is very nice, I feel as though the wording that they use to describe it is incorrect. To me the words "charge all at once" means that I can charge all the devices with only one cord that plugs into the wall. However, this is not the case. This item is simply a method for organizing you devices. Although it is a nice idea, it is certainly not worth the $34.99 I paid, and if it wasn't a gift, and Christmas wasn't 3.5 days away, I WOULD return it. I feel that by using the words, "charge all at once" they are purposely misleading the customer.
For someone like myself that is new to selling and licensing art,this book is so informative. I am so glad that I bought it. It is also a good reference book to keep on hand. I recommend it.
Fun idea.. really, really fun idea.   ---  --- However, I gave each of my teenagers (11 & 14),  a Reindeer Jelly Bean Candy Pooper.  It was some task for the kids (and the rest of the family) to get the dam things out of the packaging w/o breaking them.    The first one lost it's rear legs before getting all the way out of the package.  woof!  The second one stay together long enough to see the new year.  TIP use a razor blade and be careful of the legs
Came quickly and was exactly as offered. I am completly satisfie
I did get a nice little buzz the first two days I took this product, and it does give you a boost when you take it right before you work out.  You can push yourself a bit further at the gym.  The gassiness and stomach discomfort are what cause me to not recommend this product.  It wasn't so good or effective that the side effects were worth it.  I had no lasting weight loss when taking it, just lost 3 lbs the first 2 days taking it which climbed back on a day later.  I'd skip it
A great portable shelter for sun and rain. We bought it for a backyard event to give some shelter if it had rained. The weather turned out to be great and sunny, so the shelter was used to give our guest some shades from the bright sun. It was easy to set up and bring down. And the roller bag is also a good accessory to have to store and tranport the shelter easily
Bridget Jones, modern day woman, brillant and doesn't know it, prone to accidents and mess ups but manages to come out of them.   ---  --- This is the book that started it all with the chick lit fever.  Bridget Jones is my hero! 
I originally wanted the Orange colored Tsubos, but they were out of stock, so I decided to go with the pickle color. I absolutely love em! The comfort and style are unique and satisfying. It is because of shoes like this I have become a shoe expert of sorts
My little cousin sarah loves this toy. i bought it at wal-mart in springfield. it works with or without water and features realistic sounds. i am now on my way to purchase another for my 6 year old cousin sean
The roll of paper that I recieved had what appeares to be 3 roller marks down the paper.  I am trying to get it replaced but Adorama is not willing to help out because the order is more then 14 days old.  I was not informed to inspect the product on arrival to insure a 14 day turn aroundf on issues. --- 
Half of the product came with mold growing on it.  The other half tasted so artifical that we just threw it out
I've had this for a week, it may not function as well in a year, and that is something you might want to keep in mind reading this. ---  --- So far, however, it's been a great replacement for a wallet. Don't get me wrong, I still have my wallet and will likely use it when travelling. But for everyday use this is far more practical and comfortable to carry. It's also as easy on the eyes as it is in the pocket - equally pleasant to carry and look at. ---  --- Feels sturdy and durable; light but not flimsy. This can hold upto 5 cards and maybe 20 bill notes. ---  --- Be warned, however, although the clip does hold 5 credit card-sized cards (ID's, and whatever else you may have) it is only really easy to remove the topmost and bottom most cards. That is, if you have 5 cards you use quite often you may want to look else where. ---  --- Personally, I have an ID on the top and my credit card on the bottom. The other three cards are ones I almost never use, or use very rarely. ---  --- One of the concerns I had purchasing this is whether or not it will securly hold less than 5 cards. It does (there are pressure clips on the sides of where the card goes in), but I wouldn't recommend it. Just didn't feel safe enough, even with 4 cards. ---  --- Something I did not foresee purchasing this is that the clip secures the money very tightly. Consequently: 1) When you press down the clip, it drags the money back a few millimeters. If you put the money in too far back it'll crumple it up. 2) When secured, you can't just pull out a bill, you will have to lift the clip up. The first point I've found a little more bothersome than the second, but after playing around with it for half an hour or so I've got the hang of clamping it without crumpling the money. ---  --- That being said, it really is a very nice item and would be an awesome gift to give to a friend, husband, father, or for your own personal use - if it suites their or your dress style. ---  --- (If you are wondering why it is a 4 star and not a 5... well, for no real good reason. It does deserve 5 stars, but the little issues with the clip tugging on the money as you clamp it down - although it means money is held more securely - that holding less than 5 cards didn't feel too secure, and pulling out any card other than the top and bottom most cards is difficult, dropped it down to a 4. It may just be that these are issues that were neccessary to keep the product as fanatastic as it is. 4.5 stars might have been a welcome option, this is as close to perfect as it gets.
It never ceases to amaze me that you Brits eat this horrific dog food-paste.  ---  --- No wonder you lost the revolutionary war.   ---  --- It's clear from you eating Marmite and Vegamite that you never deserved those colonies anyway
I bought this camera for myself during Christmas 2004. ---  --- It was suppose to be a utility camera, ebay items and class projects for the kids only--I don't trust digital cameras for family photos. ---  --- The Kodak CX7300 seemed to fit the bill; inexpensive, easy to use and with more than enough resolution at 3.2mp. ---  --- The flaw in this camera didn't appear until I pulled it out of the drawer some months later. The camera wouldn't turn on. I checked the batteries and they were in excellent shape. I eventually tried replacing the batteries and, sure enough, that worked. ---  --- The next time I took out the camera, the exact same thing happened. And the time after that. ---  --- At first, I thought the CX7300 was eating the batteries. But eventually I came to the conclusion that the camera doesn't eat batteries, it nibbles at them. It won't run on anything but brand-spanking-new batteries. ---  --- The Kodak batteries that came with the CX7300 are still in my mini-mag flashlight, going strong. ---  --- I contacted Kodak about this flaw. They wanted to talk about what kind of batteries I'm using--Kodak--or the option of my purchasing a Camera Dock and some rechargeable batteries. A solution that would increase my investment by about seventy-five percent. ---  --- I thought that buying an optional AC Adapter would be the simple, and cheap, solution. Surprise, surprise, the CX7300 is one of the few digital cameras Kodak makes that doesn't take one. ---  --- So, now that I'm way past warranty, what do I do with it? ---  --- I'm shopping for another camera
We started playing this for our one year old when we were driving on a short trip out of town. As babies sometimes do, she began screaming and was unconsolable... UNTIL we turned on Rocket Ship Beach. Polly wolly doodle calmed her right down and continues to do so. We played that song at least 6 times in a row that day! now that she's a little older, she points to the cd player in the car if something else is playing, requesting her cd be played.  ---  --- I've always enjoyed a wide range of music, and was afraid that after having a child, we'd be reduced to listening to watered down "kid music" like that purple dinosaur and those australian guys. There is a mixture of classics reimagined and new songs that i find myself humming all of the time. There is a good variety of instrumentation and styles. Our daughter claps at the end of her favorites and often waves her arms about.  ---  --- Got kids? Buy this cd!
Bakel's "Pettinice" rolled fondant, imported from New Zealand, is one of the favorite choices for pastry chefs (both amateur & professional) worldwide. It's available in white, ivory, or chocolate, and can be purchased in resealable 15 lb tubs or 5 lb packages. ---  --- Fondant can be flavored with small amounts of various flavoring compounds e.g. chocolate & pure extracts. Concentrated food coloring provides you with nearly a limitless spectrum of coloring options.  ---  --- The 15 lb. tub should retail around $44.99 (plus shipping), and the 5 lb. package should retail around $16.99 (plus shipping).
I followed the advice of the reviewers before me and ordered them a half size bigger than I normally would and they fit great!  Super cute with jeans or a sexy dress!  Great job Jessica
I currently have version 1.0 on my pc. It does everything it claims to and does it flawlessly. It cleans internet cache, history, cookies and more! I've tried another internet privacy program, but it failed to clean up the tracks that this program successfully cleaned. I especially like the fact that it cleans the autocomplete entries in my internet search and internet browser. Others can use my pc, and won't be able to see what documents I've recently opened, which programs I've recently run, or what I've searched for and what sites I've visited online. And that's the way it should be! This program can be set to clean up this information securely (can be set to wipe not just delete the info). Another plus, it can clean usage tracks for all users on a pc. The program I tried on my other pc only worked with administrator accounts (and not very well may I ad)
Maybe I just got a bad one....but this darn thing broke with the FIRST piece of paper I put in it.  I hope you get a better one than I did.  
This is a great PDA Bible for many reasons, several of which are already mentioned in other reviews.  It is easy to use, has most of the NIV Study Bible notes and crossreferences, comes with a multi color highlighter (great for using different colors for different purposes...red for commands, blue for promises, etc.), you can change the font for easier reading, and it has a great search engine in case you want all of the references to, say "peace" that occured in the New Testament.  The programs that come with it are nice as well, including one that tells you what to read if you want to read the Bible in one year, the OT in one year, the NT in one year, and many more options. ---  --- I was somewhat disappointed by a few features that would have made it a hands-down 5 star program, though.  The original NIV Study Bible has elaborate introductions for each book, including author, purpose, structure, and much more.  The Palm version is lacking all of this, and has no introduction at all.   ---  --- The original also has many cultural information boxes all throughout the Bible, like a description of the differences between Pharasees and Sauducees; the palm version does not.   ---  --- The cross references are wonderful - click on a small circle after a verse, and all of the cross references pop up.  Simply click on a cross reference, and the program takes you right there.  Unfortunately, however, the Palm program has no feature like a "back" button that gets you back to the original text.  Finding your original spot is not difficult - it only takes 5 seconds and a little concentration - but would have been much nicer to go instantly back the same way you can instantly get to a cross refernce by clicking on it.   ---  --- Finally, I would be actively marketing this product and the Palm platform to all of my friends if it included all of the wonderful maps that the original has - maps of the Holyland, Jerusalem, the Middle East, the Temple, and others that are in my paper NIV Study Bible.   ---  --- Despite these flaws, however, the program is a joy to use and I highly recommend it to all.  I am using a Tungsten T3 - the larger screen size make reading easier
The emotionally healing benefits of orange oil and lavender become immediately apparent when you apply this to your scalp. If you can find someone to give you a head massage with this product, then you can truly relax. If applying this yourself, it works well as an at home hair treatment to nourish the hair follicles and promote healthy hair growth. You will also notice your hair becoming stronger and retaining a much deeper shine. The essential oils in this product help to activate micro-circulation which may cause a slight tingling and warming of the scalp. Leave this in for about 5-10 minutes and then wash your hair as normal. You may find you need less conditioner when using this product. Many hairdressers will use this product when giving a conditioning head massage and that is where I first found out about this product. I bought my first bottle the day I had the massage. I was that impressed and I keep buying this product.  ---  --- ~The Rebecca Review 
This Linksys stuff simply doesn't work. And don't try getting technical support - it's a complete waste of time. If you can't Google the solution, just take the stuff back. ---  --- The adapter install took out my TCPIP stack, even for my WIRED connection. It took me 3 full days to figure out that I needed to remove any sign of Linksys, Odyssey, and Funk Software from the registry, then remove and reinstall the TCPIP stack. Linksys support couldn't even get me a promised registry cleaner after 28 days, a dozen emails, and 5 separate phone calls. --- Linksys support is just embarrassing. Don't be caught having to depend on it
Sword looks awesome! very heavy and cool. Blade is strong but not sharp..for collector purposes. handle and point where blade connects to hilt is very shaky  but can be fixed quickly. Overall sword and scabbard are very realistic and cool looking
The Drishti Yoga Strap is just great!  I've tried a lot of straps in my time practicing yoga.  (Several different studios, borrowed friends', etc.)  This one is excellent.  It's 2 feet longer than standards straps, but it's offered at the same price as standard straps - what a deal!  It's also thick and sturdy.  I would certainly recommend this product
Valerian and Chamomile are blended with spearmint leaves, lemon grass, hawthorn berries and orange blossoms to create a delicious tea to savor late at night before you drift off into dreams. This tea is much more effective than regular Sleepytime and I can say this because my sleep cycle has been fairly regular with much fewer nights of tossing and turning. You may also find that your mood the next day is rather mild and you feel more relaxed in general. This could be due to getting a good night's sleep for a change or it could be that the valerian has a lasting effect. Valerian is a very effective herb if you can't get to sleep and this tea is highly recommended for insomnia. Unlike sleeping pills, you won't feel groggy the next morning. Blend in a little lavender or orange blossom honey to enhance this deliciously mild minty tea.  ---  --- ~The Rebecca Review  ---  --- 
Great magazine. They got good tips on everything. Eating/Building Muscle/Sheddin excess fat/ All that. Recommend this mag to body builders. I get it every month. Good stuff
very excellent flavor.  I gave my son a few packets, and he said that his 9-month-old grabbed some off his plate.  A lttle spicy, but excellent over Jasmine rice
I can't say enough good about this lipstick.  I am a Black woman with a light-skinned golden brown complexion, like Halle Berry.  When I received the Malibu Peach my first impression was that it was too light and that my lips were going to look ashy.  However, when applied it is the perfect smooth sheer soft peach color.  It's a very rich product and the case is elegant. It doesn't have that funky smell or taste that a lot of lip products do and it's not sticky!!  I love MAC but if my hair blows into my face it sticks to my lips (eww).  Big ups to Mally! (thumbs that is..lol) I will definitely be trying some other Mally products.  I also ordered the brow kit in Sable which is first rate
I am a fan of Ralph Lauren and check new products from this brand. I liked this scent, although I am probably more used to Polo Blue, which is also great. It is better to get an idea in a store because it is not quite possible to decide from reviews. Anyway, it is worth checking especially if you are looking for a new cologne for St. Valentine's day
I received these earrings as a gift, and I don't know what they are made of, but I get an awful lot of compliments on them.  They seem to change color in response to what I am wearing.  I would definitely order other Silver Insanity items
This is the best diet product ever!  I tried them all and "SKINNY WATER?" is the easiest and cheapest diet idea ever.  The product taste great and it really removes any desire to eat too much.  I drink just 3 bottles a day and so far the pounds just melt away.  I lost 15 lbs. in 20 days.  Great taste, it works great, and it's so inexpensive.  Great job to who ever came up with the idea of drinking water and losing weight.  The owners should hire me to do commercials for them
This is a really nice remake of a great classic (FFIV).  They improved the dialogue, and added in a lot of great items.  The challenge level, however, was bumped up significantly.  The game was originally paced so you didn't have to spend nearly as much time leveling up.  A few of the bosses surprised me this time through (I've played the SNES version multiple times in my day).  The story is unchanged, however.  A must have for any FF/Classic RPG fan!  As a bonus, I finally got to play Chrono Trigger
This CD is absolutely wonderful. I am in Australia so Strawberry Shortcake merchandise is not as readily available down here as it is in the USA, so you can imagine my daughters delight when this CD is being played. --- The songs are just gorgeous - I just wish they were a little longer. --- I thoroughly recommend this item to any little SS Fans. --- 
I have been using this cord for about a year, and I had problems with its durability.  It actually worked fine for a for the first 5 months, but then it started to fall apart.  When mounted on the hotshoe of my flash bracket, the thin plastic shoe (where the flash is attached to) developed a crack and eventually broke off, making it useless to mount the flash.  I had to buy a replacement part from Canon (who charged me $16 for this small plastic piece).  I flipped the flash carefully from then on, but then it still cracked!!  I wrote to Canon and asked them to reinforce the bottom maybe made of metal instead of thin plastic. So far, there is no response.  A few months later, the cord, for some unknown reason, makes my 550ex flash switch from the ETTL to TTL mode, and making the flash fire at full power, overexposing  the entire image.  I checked the flash by putting it directly on the camera's hotshoe, and the flash worked fine, switching back to the ETTL mode.  For a piece of equipment from Canon, it's hard to imagine it giving so many problems. It's like they only paid tons more attention to their cameras than their accessories.  As there are no other OEM manufacturers of this cord, I am forced to get another one and hope for the best.
As a field engineer I have to work with tools inside machinery.  More often than not I keep my watch and I have had several scratched watches in the past. So I was somewhat skeptical to wear a nice watch like this but the price seemed right to give it a try. After 9 months of using it daily, this watch has still not a single scratch. The quality is very good and it really looks better than on the picture
After been loaned this issue of June 2004, by a committed, really --- genuine Episcopalian, I was greatly impressed! These creative, unique articles captured my Imagination: "What is Power?" by Sam Keen; "Taking the First Step" by Anna Lappe`; "Accessing Sacred Energy," by Judith Orloff, MD; "The Making of a Chaplain" By Karen O'Brien (So like the pages of my earlier Verbatim in CPE). ---   --- "The Best Spiritual Books" are reviews of 50 out of 300 books by Fred and Mary Ann Brussat! We surely agreed on the first few named: "The Heart of Christianity" Marcus Borg; "Beyond Belief" Elaine Pagels; "The Wisdom Way of Knowing" Cynthia Bourgeault; ++ --- "The Lord is My Shepherd" Rabbi Kushner+ "The Power of Patience" by M J Ryan!   ---  --- I am still in the whirlwind of those emotionally stimulating, artistically written articles on varied yet potent topics of food for Thought and Reflection. Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood 
Most of the other reviews printed here I am in agreement with.  There is little I need to add except that I saw the film for the first time in the eighties when it came out on tape.  I just rewatched it and still find my gut reaction to be the same and then some.  Schlesinger's work, the three leads and the marvelous script make for an engrossing, sobering and disturbing treatise on how so many people lack values and seek "happiness" in all of the wrong places -- especially in the wrong people.  After the twenty-odd years of first viewing this film, I realized tonight how strong Julie Christie's performance is in this film.  There is not one hole in this bravura performance.  It's odd to make this statement, especially since she's playing such a shallow role.  It's not an easy nor a desirable part to play, but she carries it off as if she herself were the character.  Selfishness is at the core of the character as well as immaturity, and she stoops and conquers. ---  --- Laurence Harvey has never played the rogue better and Dirk Bogarde is perfect as the jilted lover who indeed possesses a heart, but nevertheless gives in (but not completely) to Ms. Christie's empty needs.  He, indeed, sees through her throughout most of the film but cannot help being swayed by her charms. ---  --- Emptiness served up brilliantly.  And we must respect the talents involved for providing us with a lesson -- as well as thank them (on two levels at least: talent coupled with making us examine what should really be of value to us)
It's nice and has yet to fall apart in 10 belly dancing classes.  The only thing is that every other triangle does not have coins, so you are only getting half as many coins as pictured.  However, for the price I would rather that than have it full of coins and falling apart. 
Simple and elegant earrings. My wife loves them.  However, the backs are a trifle small to work with. --- BA
THIS ITEM IS SUCH A HUGE HUNK OF JUNK! FIRST OFF THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE TOTALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FIGURE OUT AND SECOND OFF THE OUTSIDE TEMP IS ALWAYS OFF BY AT LEAST 12 DEGREES.
Even though Gordon Lui is the main reason you're buying this film, the story isn't bad either. Excellent training sequences and even better fighting sequences. My only complaint was a dragged out jail scene which lasts about 15 minutes. But that scene is not enough to tarnish this film. This is a solid film
These seat covers are allot prettier then the picture. Just recieved mine today and I am very pleased...
These are more of an accent light than task lights...not what I expected.  should have paid attention to other reviews
Fantastic pop up book!  Easy to keep the Preschool children's attention when telling this story
When I purchased mine, there was no Diaper Dekor+ which is the larger size.  However, I feel that we have no need for a larger one.  My child just turned two and it holds a weeks worth of diapers...no problem!  I bought the Diaper Genie because I was told so many things about it and I hate it, it goes through bags quickly and the bags have a weird odor to them.  I am currently pregnant and am sensitive to odors and the Diaper Dekor holds them all in until garbage day comes
We bought this bulk box because we drink a lot of tea...it's a great bargain if you're a tea drinker!!! :)
I got this camera about 2 years ago because my sd 200 broke. It is soooo easy to use and takes great pictures. Its also very sleek and small
explodes upon the crime-detective scene. THE HUNDRETH MAN, his first book was excellent and THE DEATH COLLECTORS is as good and even better. Can't wait for the next one! ---  --- Why this is an Amazon sale item befuddles me. But since it is , grab this bargain while you can because it is a terrific novel! ---  --- The PSIT team of LAPD, Carson Ryder and Harry Nautilus are faced with a dual-time mystery. More than 30 years in the past, a serial killer with a following of mesmerized women who adore him, is killed in the courtroom the day he is sentenced. ---  --- And NOW; starting with the grizzly find of a murdered prostitute in a seedy motel room...it seems as though the serial killer has risen from the dead to continue his reign of terror. Each time a new murder surfaces the killer is a step ahead and just out of reach of Carson and Harry. The touch of subtle humor adds bas-relief without taking anything away from the thread of the story and lightens it tension for brief seconds at a time.Perfect! ---  --- The murders are freakish! Disgusting! Brutal! But the two PSIT detectives refuse to give up and what finally unravels the twisted cloth of this old/new mystery will knock you out of your chair. ---  --- A truly masterfully plotted novel with two familiar and charismatic 'partners against crime'. A series to follow and enjoy. Get both of Kerley's books and double your pleasure! ---  --- Try them, you'll like them and you'll love Jack Kerley. I promise!!
I really think it's Simon's best.  This, and perhaps (in a very different style) "Paul Simon."  I'm just listening to it again after several years...the melodies are intricate, the words are vivid and allusive, the range is astounding.  Graceland has a wonderful rock-style going on, but I really think this is my favorite.  I know a lot of non-Simon fans who love this one album.  It's just fantastic
I am satisfied with the product.  For that matter I know it before I bought and I am satisfied with it.  The only glitch is it will take some time to start and until it starts we may not be able to browse or use any applications that needs internet.  Still I would suggest it is a best option to buy one for ur computer safety
Things that I like:  --- (1) The option to tile the front of the keyboard up makes typing much more comfortable.  I was a skeptic about it before I purchased it, but really do like it.  Also, this is the first keyboard that I have used that allows for so many typing angles.   --- (2) The included software gives a great deal of control over customizing all of the extra keys on the keyboard.  Even if you don't have Windows Vista, you can program the gadgets key to suit your needs.   --- (3) The keyboard has no lag for me, whatsoever.   --- (4) I'm a big fan of the standard 3x2 key setup for the home keys, etc.   --- (5) This is a small change, but I'm using this setup on Dell Inspiron 6000 laptop.  The software replaced the large volume notifications (onscreen display showing volume level, mute, etc.) with a smaller more attractive style notification.  Me gusta.   --- (6) The curved keyboard is also comfortable.  It requires no time nor effort getting used to it.   --- (7) I haven't had any problems with the keyboard being "out of range."   --- (8) For the mouse, I'm switching from the Wireless Intellimouse Explorer 3.0, which is also made by Microsoft, to the Laser 6000 mouse included.  This new mouse is more comfortable. (not a huge difference, but noticeable.)  It is also lighter, and slides around with little effort. ---  --- What I don't like: --- (1) The lock key above the number pad is set by default to display the same two options as when you click 'Start' then 'Log off Windows.'  I would have liked the option to change the key to the Shut Down / Hibernate dialog instead.  I haven't found that option available, so far. --- (2) The keyboard is a little bit wider than others, but I don't find it to be a problem.  It's just different.  Having the additional programmable buttons outweighs the downside of having the extra width. ---  --- Five Stars
this is the worst piece of junk i have ever purchased, i cant believe it, please dont waste your time or money on this, it b    roke the second day, rubber bands poped man what a piece of junk  i rate it a fat zero but i only had an option to give it a one
An absolute must have for all parents, families and professionals!  As a speech & language pathologist, I have worked with special needs children for 17 years, and finally I have viewed a high quality product for children diagnosed with Down Syndrome.  Informative, comprehensive and heart warming are just a few words to describe this excellent DVD.  I would highly recommend it for not only families, but for ALL professionals working with this population.  In fact, I believe it should be part of the training and curriculum for all disciplines intending to serve these wonderful children.  Thanks for a great product
No problem whatsoever with this product.  It was delivered in a timely manner and worked perfectly
I accidentally ordered this one instead of the Kolcraft Universal carrier, since they are both called the Universal carrier.  This car seat carrier is over-engineered with too many moving parts that are completely unnecessary.  Rather than returning it, my husband wanted to eat the $59.99 plus shipping by beating it up with a baseball hat.  We went out and purchased the Kolcraft Universal carrier-- it is much simpler, easier to fold, and has a large, functional basket underneath the car seat. 
Received my vanilla beans very quickly.  They arrived fresh, sealed well and exactly as we'd hoped
The Organizer works well for keeping disparate shopping items from rolling around in the back of the car.  I do wish the partitions were actually attachable by velcro to the organizer and soft.  The hard plastic partitions is this Organizer are simply square plates that can be stuck in between items.  I tend to not use them since they don't even work to soften the bumps between jossling items. My husband's trunk organizer (which I didn't buy because it cost 3x as much) has the softer, attachable partitions.  I guess that would be worth the money in retrospect for MY needs.  But in all this is great for the price. Now I get to the office, or home, and easily carry everything in at once to unload
I have a pair if clogs from Europe that I wear in the operating room.  I need to replace them.  They are European size 50.  So what's the deal?  You don't make your shoes in Men's sizes.  You think we all have girley feet?  Get with it, clowns.  Real men occasionally wear clogs too.  You can't make a size 16
hard to Believe that Sidney Poitier went from Directing a Classic Comedy like "Stir Crazy" to this Music Video not ready for MTV type of Film.very 80's Campy&it was Corny then as it is now
The author had a great idea, but he cherry-picked the available info about Superman and the writers to get the book to make sense. For example, Superman was originally written as a metaphor for Jews during WW2. Two Jewish guys, right at the end of WW2, write a story of a man that has to leave his homeworld b/c it's destroyed... etc, etc. ---  --- I'm not critiscizing this book b/c it has a religious message. I'm critiscizing it b/c the author clearly left out clear facts that work against his arguement. Otherwise, I disagree with anybody that says it is "just a comic." Superman has often reflected the current values and attitudes of a large swath of America
These wipes have more perfume in them than any wipe on earth.  They are about the same softness as the Kirkland brand, but cost a lot more.  And wooohoooo, they smell stronger than este lauder herself
Upon the joyful news that we were having a girl, my husband decided to invest in a new digital camera and a photo printer. The digital camera still works great--the printer is another matter. While this one prints beautiful pictures, the cost of ink far outweighs the beauty of them sometimes. ---  --- As we all know, this is how printer companies make their money, through the ink. Replacing every cartridge at once will run you about $75 at a time, give or take a few. The gray ink is used up the quickest, and has also been one of the hardest for us to find here locally. The main problem I have with this printer is that the quality is excellent after you replace the ink, but for only about the first 50-70 pictures. After that. The pictures take on too much of a magenta cast and start to get out of register--very frustrating when you're printing out any pictures, let alone ones of your child. Yes, we do what the manual sugests for such occasions, and the main one is to clean the printer cartridge heads, but this has only actually worked for us on one occassion. Every other time get us no results and we are still stuck with pictures that resemble something a third grader took a crayon to. In the long run, I will not be buying a photo printer for home use, but will rather take them to a store for processing.  ---  --- Quality-wise, it gets you in the beginning, but doesn't hold out for the long run. We have fiddled with it for two years. Enough's enough
When I first got my phone, I was quite excited.  It had more memory than my current Treo 650 however only after one day I noticed the battery life was draining much faster than I had anticipated.  From my research, I discovered a few things that needed to be done before I extend my battery life to more than 10 hours. --- 1)I had to apply a camera patch since my phone was manufactured prior to Jan 18th.  This patch can be found on Palm support site. ---  --- 2) I needed to completely drain my battery until there was nothing then charge it for 24 hours. ---  --- Once I did these two things, my phone has lasted for a few days without a charge, and I've set my versamail to retrieve messages when they arrive.  This is a big plus for me going from getting emails every hour to getting them when they arrive. ---  --- I've had no problems with any of my SD cards or mini-SD cards.  The increase internal memory also helps since I use my TomTom navigation with my Treo.  I've heard the various complaints, but you have to work through some of them.  it is a great phone
just to make the plot work.  Not very realistic.  If you want a realist cop character, try Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch.
Some of the other reviews have said that the film is not editted properly and 'too slow'. I'm not a film-maker and cannot comment on that other than to say that they are wrong. The film is amazing. I'm not sure if there is ANY other movie or documentary that shows what a serialkiller-cum-dictator-cum-statesman is like. Nowadays people might not know who Idi Amin is, or what he did, so its important to read up a little so you can truely appreciate this movie. He plays accordian? You see him meeting with his 'advisors' (some of whom disappear so after.) You see him play acting like a grown-up boy with toy soldiers. You see his self-appointed royal pedigree and send his support for Nixon! Its fascinating and amazing. This is man that, self-proclaimed, actually ATE some of his rivals (not the whole body I hope). He killed many people directly and by his policies. His ego is outstanding and its an amazing movie. Apparently, there is a new movies coming out about Idi Amin starring Forrest Whitaker. He's a good actor and so I look forward to seeing it. But this is the REAL guy. Its amazing and a feat probably never to happen again
If you own a Q, you know the battery life with the standard battery is horrible.  This charger also has a slot for a 2nd battery, which is great. So I can charge my phone with the standard battery, and have the extended one Verizon sells in the back slot. Never having to worry about battery life again. Also, it makes a wonderful stand for the phone, and when hooked to the USB cable, you get data conectivity too.  Only downside, it won't charge the extended battery until the phone is fully charged.
i bought this mic online for $150 new. i researched for a while and decided this was the best option. i use a canon GL2 and this is a nice addition to my rig. ---  --- at first i didnt think the audio was all that great, however, when i turned on the microphone attenuate feature of my camera and switched to the manual audio controls, i found that this mic has a lot of potential. with the attenuate on, you can really get clear audio without outside noise messing up your tracks. i pointed the mic at an actor on screen, then pointed the mic away from the actor and you could definetly here a difference in audio detail. ---  --- note: the mic has two different posistions to mount the hot shoe mount, a standard tripod mount, and an addition threaded hole which rode claimes to be a microphone stand mount. my mic stand doesnt thread into this hole, and i consider my mic stand to be pretty standard. however their may be some adapters at my local music store. not a big issue to consider, as there are plenty of mounting options available
This cable saves me a lot of money. I don't need to buy stuff online when now I can download it straight to my PC. makes it easy to transfer Pictures, videos, ring tones, contact numbers. It is great to put things on and off. Also great for keeping a back up
Ya tengo una semana con el y lo recomiendo ampliamente La imagen y la nitidez de este monitor son sobresalientes Con una resolucion de 1680 x 1050 las fotos tomadas con mi camara digital se ven como una imagen real Tiene varios ajustes segun el uso que le quieras dar Viene en español
I bought a 5lb. bag of these actually, and left my groceries near my desk at work.  Bad move.  My boss, ever the degenerate gambler, decided the best way to entertain himself on a slow day at work, was to have some of us engage in an onion-eating-contest.  Thankfully, the mild and slightly sweet taste of "Fresh Spanish Onions" helped me persevere over my opponent, an intern who we will refer to only as "Will C."  His choice of red onions cost him the match, as well as a date with Carol from accounting (to say nothing of the mess he had to clean up in the men's room, and his doctor's subsequent recomendation that he get a colostomy).  I'd like to thank Bill from Produce at Gristedes for his suggestion of "Fresh Spanish Onions"-- I owe ya one, buddy.  Now if only I could get my sense of smell back
When I considered purchasing this product, I was confused to see that some people thought it was great, and others thought it was terrible.  I couldn't understand why there were such discrepancies in the reviews. ---  --- After I bought it I understood: For some of the things it does, it works fine -- no problems.  However, there are many major bugs in the software, and if you need one of the buggy functions, you'll be sorry you bought it. ---  --- Examples of some problems:  ---  --- 1. If you burn an audio track entitled "Blue Fog" Nero will give it the title "Fog." ---  --- 2. Every time I run a backup, it tells me there was a write error, but the backup seems OK. ---  --- 3. I backed up every file on my drive, but when my system crashed, there were problems that prevented me from restoring my system. ---  --- 4. It has blue screened my system one time. ---  --- 5. Many commands are poorly or not at all documented.  For example, the wave editor has a declipper function, but there is no documentation on how to use it. ---  --- So, I'd recommend that you look instead at a competing product. ---  --- Good luck
I Purchased this product in Nov 2006. Reviews at other sites indicated this was a wonderful product, the very best, editor reviews - not user - the product is to new I guess. I looked at the specs and it had features which looked very appealing, so I thought I would try it - Bummer. Acronis 10 installs fine, sets up a file system on a seperate physical drive and appears to work, until you verify the images, all are corrupted. I have contacted Acronis several times, they have given me several test tools to find out what might be wrong.  Nothing has been resolved after 4 1/2 months. The tools and debuging has shown no errors in my hardware.  I have to keep using Ghost-2003 to do my images, it works fine. Acronis support acts like its a unheard of problem, but I now find references all over the Internet about this image corruption problem going back to version 6
I'm a Wiccan who formally practices within a traditional Gardnerian coven, but practices eclectically within my private practice. I read this book because I had heard that it was recommended to my local library by a Christian; purportedly, Wicca's Charm was written by an impartial writer. Immediately, you realize that this isn't true. Catherine Sanders has a clearly stated agenda: that Wiccans are simply misguided and  misunderstand that what they long for is offered by Christianity.  ---  --- I could write a long review debating the merits of Sanders' arguments. Instead, I suggest that you consider this if deciding whether to read this book which Sanders claims to have thoroughly researched. She relies on the writings of Margot Adler, Carol Christ, Starhawk and Phyllis Curott (with barely a nod to Scott Cunningham and Ronald Hutton) to draw many of her conclusions. Yet, missing from her notes are such writers as the Farrars, Merlin Stone, Raymond Buckland, Isaac Bonewits, Patricia Crowley, and the Matthews, to name just a few outstanding contributors to Neopaganism's base of knowledge.  ---  --- Too often, Sanders relies on the statements of young Wiccans she interviewed who come across as silly and naive. In another case, she bases her thesis that women's spirituality (e.g., Goddess worship)is misguided and that Christianity fits the same spiritual needs that women are seeking via ONE speech that she heard Margot Adler give shortly after 9/11.  ---  --- Sanders requests both Christians and Neopagans to read her book with an open mind. A fair request. But as you're reading, closely check out her endnotes and analyze for yourself if this book was truly researched with objectivity in mind, or whether Sanders limited herself to sources that would support her belief that Christianity has everything that a Wiccan desires. One needs to go no further than to consider that as Sanders attempts to persuade the reader that Christianity has always embraced the value of women that not once does she analyze the epistles of Paul.
I was barely able to finish this book. Armstrong makes fun of vampires and witches, etc. by dragging in all the cheesy pop culture references she can think of. This made it very hard for me to take her characters seriously. I might have been able to swallow the idea of Cabals (giant glitzy corporations run by sorcerors; it's unclear why they don't just take over the world and have done), but Armstrong really lost me during the 20-page extended send-up of Anne Rice's vampires. This genre is rapidly sinking into self-referentialism, and Armstrong is the worst culprit. In Industrial Magic, she ruins what could have been a perfectly good story with these unfunny namechecks and rebuttals to writers who are actually better than she is. On top of that, the viewpoint character, Paige, is unfortunately named: she's as flat and boring as the pages she's written on. Her central relationship is with her boyfriend, Lucas, but their coupleship seems to revolve around the trading of sexual favors. Are we supposed to think this is cute and funny?  ---  --- Take-home project for Armstrong: next time, try putting some genuine emotion into your work
I very much like these earrings.  My only reason for not giving them a 5-star rating is that the topaz is quite small.  You really have to look closely to see it.  But, they are excellent quality sterling silver and still beautiful.  I recommend them, just be aware that the stones are tiny
My fiance (now wife) and I have been looking for a workable solution for the hair down under.  She has tried waxing - too painful - and shaving would cause a lot of bumps and irritation, even with the Shick Intutition.  Her pubic region was basically living on Neosporen, Bikini Zone, and Gold Bond (not together and not in any particular order).  We also tried scissors, but that was hard to negotiate, if you will, in the more intimate of areas.  At this point she was seriously thinking laser hair removal, but wasn't ready to pony up the $$ and commit to an irrevocable decision.  Although, based on the other posts here and accepted fashion trends, I highly doubt that an "au natural massive overgrowth" will be in style. ---  --- The trimmer is great.  Yes, Amazon should take down the photo of the storage pouch.  Yes, it won't get you totally smooth or bald.  But it is a well built TRIMMER, which is painless and easy to use.  You can adjust the length you want, and you can easily work around the more sensitive and intimate southern locations.   ---  --- Just take it easy around the labia minora and remember to use a mirror.  If you want the smooth look, use this handy device before you break out the razor and shaving cream/lotion. It makes it much easier and cuts down on irritation. ---  --- I suppose, although we have no interest in it, that you can get creative with styling your pubic hair into shapes and designs.  Hey what ever works for you and/or you an your partner
Great magazine. Covers the full range of .NET technologies. Every issue is packed with windows, web, and xml development articles plus industry news and a lot more. High recomended
This FUGIFILM PADDED SOFT CASE is strong, durable and very attractive. It was more than I expected. It is very professional looking
You know right away your teeth feel different, much like how they feel after a dentist cleaning. ---  --- The dual action (larger) head is gentler and feels more like a normal toothbrush but it certainly isn't as aggressive as the smaller one in it's ability to clean. If you can handle the smaller heads they certainly do a better job. The flossing attachment was also very effective
Bands from the 90s just sucked and Nirvana fits in with that. They had a couple of ok songs and Kurt Cobain was some what talented but this is nothing to get excited about. I can not for the life of me see the things people see that just go off about how great they were. I don't see it. This is another cd in a long line of cds from the 90s that are a disgrace to music.
I have played through Fable and The Lost Chapters several times. All in all, this is a very fun game. The classic RPG elements of leveling up, buying or finding new and better weapons and armor, choosing to focus on magic use or hack and slash, and choosing to be good or evil are all included in Fable. The graphics are superb for its time, and the voice acting is top notch. In addition, the storyline is quite good, and is more complex than the average RPG 'save the world' tale. I have heard some complaints of Fable being too short, but if you take all the quests and max out all levels, the game length should be just fine (unless you are expecting a 50+ hours Morrowind experience). ---    Where Fable loses some points is the controller setup. The button configuration can be overwhelmingly complex, so much so that finding yourself using an item you did not mean to use can be a frequent occurance. In addition, you may find yourself using magic at an inopportune time, simply because you pressed the R trigger by mistake. The bow aiming feature might pop on at a bad time (like when you are being attacked by 4 creatures), and while rotating the camera view, the map pop-up might fill your screen as you are in the midst of battle (thus obscuring your view). ---   Also, Fable does tend to have some save problems. You may complete some quests and save, and upon reloading, the quests may have to be recompleted, or worse, may not have been saved and will not be offered again!  ---    Still, these are rather minor complaints. While Fable really doesn't live up to its advertising of being an all-immersive RPG, it is quite good, and a blast to play if you like D&D styled RPG's. If you like Zelda games but wish they were more adult, definitely check out Fable
The casting for this production could scarcely be better (of particular note is the harrowing performance of Judi Dench) and it's one of Shakespeare's best plays. That said, this film of a production on stage doesn't quite carry the viewer's interest for the entire play. There are times when the actors seem downright pretentious; you feel as if they're tellings us, "We know how deep this is so appreciate it, please." That's too bad since "Macbeth" is a work thriving with intense imagination with a few hallucinations thrown in so it should invite a great film. Sadly, this relatively slow-moving production isn't it. There are, of course, wonderful moments with Mackellan and particularly Dench (no one plays the scene where Lady Macbeth goes crazy better than Dame Judi). I just don't know if that alone makes this a worthwhile purchase. For my money, Kurosawa's "Throne of Blood" is a far better choice.
I purchased this commentary for an in-depth study that I was doing on Wednesday evenings.  I carefully checked a bunch of commentaries on Amazon, hoping to find the one that would help me with insights that I could share in the study. ---  --- Unfortunately, this volume hasn't lived up to my hopes.  I didn't need something that would offer the obvious points (I can do that myself).  I was hoping for something that would offer insights into some of the more difficult and confusing passages, including thoughts on how those passages apply to our lives today.  I've been disappointed.  I am now well into the study and rarely even check the book anymore as I'm gathering information. ---  --- I was between this one and the Carson commentary.  Obviously, I think I made the wrong decision.  (Not that there's anything theologically wrong in the text - it's just not what I was hoping for.
GREAT PRODUCT! This tool is very intuitive and easy to use. I find the greatest value is in having the MIL codes internal to the device, which makes finding the faulty component right at your fingertips. I bought the OBDII Fault code book, but quickly learned that I didn't need to have it
Not what I expected.  The box was handmade, the instructions were some other tool.  I have contacted seller and was not satisfied with response
I've had this camera for three years.  I bought it new, when it was cutting edge and very expensive.  I put a 128MB CF card in it. ---  --- First, I have to say that I have NEVER had the slightest problem with this camera or the software.  I've probably taken upwards of 5000 pictures with it, it's been all over the country.  The software has been installed on Windows 95, 98, 2000 and XP and I haven't had any problems with it.  The camera is solid, performs well, takes good pictures, and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the LCD viewfinder. If battery life were that big a deal, one could purchase a second battery and rotate. ---  --- All that said, I am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera.  They are razor sharp, the color balance is perfect, and the focus is great.  When taking pictures of people, however, it shows EVERY flaw in the subject's skin.  Scratches, oil, freckles are magnified and come out looking horrific.  It requires extensive Photoshopping to fix the flaws.  Other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better.   ---  --- I will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture. By the time the shot's taken, something (especially a squirmy child or a sports play) has invariably moved and it's not the exact picture you wanted. ---  --- I'm going to buy a real Single-Lens Reflex (SLR) to take baby pictures, but I'll keep this as a travel camera
This band is getting alot of critical acclaim right now, but I'm just not feeling it. The single "Wolf like me" is the only song that stands out to me on the whole album. It is a great song, but everything else is just blah. I think the band could use a different singer, the guy they got doesn't sing very well or very "soulful". The music is good, very original and the only reason I haven't sold the cd yet. I really think ppl need to hear this one for themselves before they buy. Don't be fooled by these 5 star reviews. Just listen to the cd before you buy it. That's my advice
The new office 2007 is completely revamped from older versions and is well worth the four year wait. ---  --- +'s --- 1.New Interface with improved accessibility to all features, you can reach all the features that were hidden away inside those menus and no need to memorize the menu contents/options. --- 2. If you are a developer you can write your own custom panes using Visual Studio. --- 3. Great Plug-ins (like the save as PDF/XPS thing available as a free dwnld), massive clip-art/template library. ---  --- -s --- 1.Overpriced by about 40%. Somwhere around 250-300 wud have been the right price for the Pro Edition. --- 2. Some backward compatability issues with the document formats and templates and doesn't work with Adobe Acrobat as of now
My kids grew up overseas and are quite familiar with Renaissance paintings. They've seen many of these paintings and are very familiar with them. I realize this is not the typical situation. ---  --- I was disappointed that the game is basically a game of luck. It is not challenging or reinforcing of our kid's knowledge. I had hoped for a game like "Famous Authors" which builds on and tests the level of knowledge of the players.  ---  --- Nonetheless, the game is well presented. It's on the expensive side, but the book alone is worth half the price. Looking for a fancy gift with cultural overtones? I recommend this
The nippits didn't really work for me and they were painful to remove
This CD is great.  It is a must have.  Picture yourself in the wild or on a lake in a boat and a thunderstorm comes rolling in slowly.  You hear the rain, the thunder in the distance, you sense the storm getting closer.  The storm is over head, loud piercing thunder claps and you duck for cover.  The thunderstorm slowly moves out but the rain is a constant presents.  The thunder rolls on but the wild life moves in, bullfrogs, owls in the distance, all the animals are alive now.  This cd is all in one, the real deal.  It is not all thunder.  I love it.  I also bought Thunderstorm [Rykodisc]; this was a waste of money.  To me, in my opinion it sounds like the storm just knocked the cable out, static and more static. 
Wow, this was awful! The best thing about this DVD is that it doesn't last long. My boyfriend and I sat down to watch this together (in the mood to begin with) and both of us were completely turned off by it. The woman is not even naked, and wears a nightie throughout the DVD. She also is extremely hairy (a matter of personal taste I know, but this was very extreme). The tone of it was decidedly unsexy, more of a strictly how-to than a way to excite the watcher(s). It seemed to me to be very low-budget and unimaginative. Spend your money on something else if you're looking for sexual excitement..
Man, have I given this guy a chance.  Multiple chances.  Listened to the CDs, saw the big HBO special.  I mean, his career is red hot now.  He clearly has lots of fans.  Mostly college age (perhaps this should be a warning to some of you).  All I can say is "maybe they'll grow out of it."  He is NOT funny.  His act has no bite, no point of view, no opinion/viewpoint at all.  His comedy consists of spewing observations his audience can relate to (the "this is all happened to us" or "has this ever happened to you?" school of humor).  He runs about manically, acting out every little word that comes out of his mouth (for those in the audience that may not be so good with words).  His fans acknowledge that, yes, they can relate.  "Yeah!  That's happened to me!"  "I know that reference!'  They laugh, cheer, clap, and plunk down their hard-earned dollars for his vanilla wit.  He never actually COMMENTS on the things he discusses in any intelligent, interesting way.  He has no edge.  He's not outraged by anything.  He's cute 'n' cuddly.  Richard Pryor must be rolling in his grave at the very fact that Cook is classified as a stand up comic.  "Pryor?  The guy writing this must be OLD!'  Okay, try this on for size:  Chris Rock is good comedy.  Same with Dave Chappelle.  Carlin.  Laura Kightlinger.  Kinison.  Rodney Dangerfield.  Bob Saget.  Gilbert Gottfried.  Dom Irrera.  Lewis Black.  Robert Klein.  The late Mitch Hedberg.  Jim Norton.  Patton Oswalt.  Brian Posehn.  DeGeneres.  Jon Stewart.  Bob & David.  The UCB.  I'm not even a big fan of Sarah Silverman, but at least she's trying to bring something different to the party.  Anything but this!  God help us.  Let's hope he goes the way of Carrot Top and Dice soon (don't forget, Cook fans, Mr. Top and Mr. Clay were once as popular as your boy here)
If you like physics, this is just an interesting book. It mostly discusses, at length, two ideas: emergence and reductionism. Doesn't sound like much, and it isn't, but at least it gives you a different point of view on the world. Unfortunately, from this point of view to the horizon is not that far. Mr. McLaughlin almost calls the present theories (like string theory) science fiction, easy on science (because of the scales and energies involved, he seems to think they are not provable; I don't have the knowledge to discuss if he is right or not), but he doesn't offer much of an alternative. He even comes close to saying that deeper levels of understanding are not possible, or not practical.  --- Well, even if he is right, which I hope he isn't, between can't and science fiction, I prefer science fiction. Tomorrow I'll read a bit of string theory, and shake off the depressive mood left by this book
I bought this for my daughter when she was 2. I agree with the other reviewer about the weight of the product. It is so heavy that it can actually hurt a child if it turns over. I still let my daughter play with it but only when she's being supervised around it. And I have to make sure that the toy is not on any type of unstable ground. There are other good shape sorters out there - I wouldn't waste the money on this one because of the potential safety hazard.
Most annoying thing is that I hooked up through HDMI for 2 of my components however this receiver requires you too also hook audio connections as well if using the HDMI (I used optical). What the hell is the deal with that? At first I thought that maybe if you do that then the receiver wont have to be on to have sound output to your TV or something but nope no sound if the system is turned off as well. HDMI is supposed to make it more convenient, 1 cable etc... why is this necessary???????  --- Secondly my receiver is not working properly. The sound output to the rear speakers is low volume and garbled 99% of the time. Running the auto MACC fails out, manually I see that it outputs surround right speaker to the front right speaker????? Nothing is hooked up to this output on the receiver so nothing should be outputting at all during this part, surround left is silent as it should be.  Occasionally the right rear speaker will blast out 3 times louder then it supposed to be.  Adjusting the volume takes it back down to the low garbled norm. If I select the different output options, basically pushing buttons for no reason sometimes the audio will be correct and does sound amazing.  --- I am current in process to return my faulty receiver for a replacement as I do think the receiver is nice if its working, I enjoy the IPOD dock that has output to your tv as well. --- I major concern is something is wrong with there HDMI circuitry and causing my problems and the replacement will be bad as well. I will update when I get the replacement installed.
The Jerdon 7P7506CF (or as I call it, the ol'6CF) is a nice, reflective wall-attachable mirror.  I can't say enough about how reflective this thing is; I'm a bit of an amateur facepainter (although I have zero artistic ability- my Spider-Man faces usually end up looking like spotty tomatoes), so I need a good mirror whenever I self-paint.  I have gone through three similar models before finding the 6CF, and none has been as clear and user-friendly. ---  --- In short, if you're looking for the best mirror value for your dollar, I can't recommend this thing enough.  It's the mirror of the 21st century, and beyond
If I could give less than 1 star for any Trend Micro product I would. It gives too many false positives when you don't even have a virus. You are going nuts trying to find where the virus is and there is not even one there as Trend told you there was. Avoid this like the plague and save your hard earned money. It's a piece of crap.
Immediately upon starting Dickens' "Our Mutual Friend," I was struck by parallels with Dumas' "The Count of Monte Cristo."  Both big novels revolve around a powerful character who conceals his identity in a complicated plot to obtain social justice.  The Count deals with the darker theme of revenge.  Our Mutual Friend is an exploration of the corrupting influence of wealth. ---  --- The novel is lively throughout, as  Dickens displays his tremendous diversity of writing talents.  The tone ranges from heavily ironic criticism of upper-class politics and antisemitism, to delicate romance, to witty visual humor.  The characterizations are highly original; even those at the extremes of vice and virtue display engaging ideosyncracies. ---  --- Most impressive to me was the consistency of Dickens' plot.  Our Mutual Friend was written and published in installments, as was The Count of Monte Cristo.  But Dickens keeps his story on track throughout, never dropping a character, while Dumas' tale is full of gaps and inconsistencies
Smells DIVINE! This is a powder-sweet and refreshing scent that won't overwhelm the senses. It's soft and subtle, yet killer if it complements your body chemistry. I love using this particular fragrance (especially during special occasions). It exudes both simplicity and sophistication--wonderful qualities that make me feel so feminine and utterly sexy!!! Try it
I'm a culinary historian and author (CALIFORNIA PIONEERS, their stories, culture and cuisine)who spends a lot of time delving into the pages of history, especially food history. When I want to give my burned-out peepers a break, I reach for this magazine. ---  --- As much as I love the food articles -- mostly because, as great as they look, realistically they are quite do-able for just about anyone -- what I really find useful is the "Ask Martha" column in which practical answers are given to problems readers write in about. ---  --- And then there are the craft projects...I have tried several and was surprised by my success. I credit this to the well laid-out photos and very clear instructions.  ---  --- My advice is, if you are looking for a magazine that touches on every aspect of living and enjoying a well-designed (and I do not mean "haughty") lifetsyle, then you cannot go wrong with Martha Stewart Living. ---  --- Also, the special holiday ideas are the best ever...makes one wonder, how do they keep coming up with such unique ideas that are do-able for the general population?[...
The foil is a bit misleading, because if you are shaving parts of your body with many curves (under the zipper) the timmer will catch you and it hurts, a lot. The foil can ONLY be used on straight surfaces. The two trimmer blases rest at about a 200degree angle. If you have to many curves to mow with the foil without hitting the trimmer.... well, be prepared to spend a night or two on the sofa
I have found that the MS-5700 to be very loud. The Braun 8995 that I replaced it with is very quiet. The plastic chrome on the body gives it a very cheap feel, and look, it makes it hard to hold onto. I have found that the shaver dosn't give me a very close shave compared to the Braun 8985 shaver. The solution tank for the cleaner seems to be not as user friendly as the Braun 8985 that holds a cartridge that slips in and out to replace. As you have read I have replaced the MS-5700 already with the Braun 8985, and am very happy with the change. The Braun also came with 3 cartridges for the cleaner unit, not just one bottle to pour into the cleaner.
The mirror's light is quite dim and the magnification (5x)is inadequate for most purposes
Sorry, but this movie BLEW!  The premise was there, but the delivery just sucked.  I can only take the suspension of belief so far.  We are supposed to believe that this guy has never told his new gf (whom he's been w/for at least a year) about his last, one before that, and gf before that.  At least two of them have his home phone number: they've never called? She's never seen the caller ID?  She's never answered the phone? Give me a break!  THen she holds fake interviews with the exes and just opens up the most ridiculous can of worms. She meets up with Joyce (the most recent) whom she finds out that she genuinely likes, and starts believing that the bf should really be with her.  Joyce is none the wiser, but if you ask me, Joyce had stalker qualities b/c she harassed him when he was with the model, calls his house right back when she gets the call on her phone, keeps that stupid boomerang IN A FRAME, etc.   ---  --- This chick, Stacy (Brittany M) had to be incredibly stupid not to see where this was ultimately going. Holly Hunter's character is precisely why I have more male friends than female. Stacy just met this woman and she's revealing all these things about her personal life and this woman is all too happy to help her wallow in the craziness of this movie. I never expected the 'big climax,' but I did ask myself several times "will this Barb (HH) chick back the **** off?!"   ---  --- On to the climax:it was actually a surprise, but what blew me was that everything ended up honky dory for Stacy...after she humiliated all those people. I never got the impression that the bf (Derrick) was cheating on her, yet that tacky talk show would have made you think different.  The ONLY reason he pissed me off was because he didn't read STacy the riot act in the end. ---  --- This movie tries to wax philosophical, and you just end up hating all of the characters...except for the dog.   ---  --- A very passible movie.  I wouldn't even bother.
Canon makes a great underwater housing for a reasonable price.  I purchased this for a recent trip to Grand Cayman and Cozumel.  I didn't go Scuba diving on this trip, but I did take the camera snorkeling (diving to depths ~20ft).  It worked flawlessly and I got some pictures I was very happy with!  One thing I did not anticipate was the use the camera got out of the water.  Going from AC to the hot humid outdoors, my EOS rebel fogged up (condensation) and even after 30 minutes I couldn't take good pictures.  With the SD110 in the UW housing, I just wipped the housing's glass portal with a lens tissue after it had warmed up a couple of minutes and I was able to take clear pictures.  ---  --- The instructions are pretty good, but it took me a while to figure out how to take out the O-ring seal for cleaning/lubing.  Once I figured it out, it wasn't so hard. ---  --- The SD110 may be getting a little old, but it still takes decent pictures and even with the housing I don't have so much money tied up in the system that I would be devestated if it was lost or stolen.  I will probably upgrade to the SD550 or SD500 (they both use the same batteries as the SD110) with the WP-DC80 or WP-DC70 housing at some time in the near future, but I will definitely keep the SD110 and WP-DC10 as backups
For around $20. dollars you could save your life and the ones you love. ---    This is super easy to use....both the transmitter & reciever run on batteries so there's no installation. I put mine on my back porch so when --- I open the door to let my dogs out at night for a quick run nobody will --- be there to surprise me. People who keep dogs for protection are fooling themselves. But these units are perfect. I've had mine for several days --- and NOT once has it gone off for no reason....but it HAS sounded every time it should have. The range is even better then I expected. Only two things I'd change. Why the LED on the transmitter? I taped a dime over mine so it doesn't show. Why alert intruders they're being watched? And --- it would be nice if the reciever could be plugged into an AC outlet to save on batteries. I have ordered a second one because this little device really gives me peace of mind
I HAD NEVER TRIED ANYTHING FROM PHILOSOPHY AND WANTED TO TRY THE 3 IN 1 STUFF, AND I THOUGHT THE LAVENDAR POUND CAKE WOULD SMELL REALLY GOOD. I WAS ACTUALLY REALLY DISAPPOINTED. IT SUCKS AS A SHAMPOO, AND BODY WASH TOO- I ORDERED THE BLUEBERRY PIE TOO, AND I HAVEN'T EVEN USED IT, ITS JUST SITTING IN MY CLOSET. FOR THE PRICE YOU GET A LOT AND LASTS LONG, BUT I WASN'T IMPRESSED
cases very cheaply made. Break when opening. Not worth shipping cost waste of money
Musicals are historically slight in the plot department, and this movie is no exception.  Three stars: one fading, one rising and one coasting do not help matters either. ---  --- Rita is the fading star.  It was painful for me to watch the once dazzling love goddess reduced to playing the controlling widow.  The make up department probably had to work overtime trying to cover the circles under her eyes, and her hair and costumes are just bad.  Novak is the rising star, although I don't get the 50's obsession with bubble headed, busty, bleach blond bimbos.  It would help if she could act, but sadly her range is very limited. I truly believe they added the dog to help make her character sympathetic, since she was unable to convey it herself.  Then there is Frank just coasting on his charm and cool.  Doesn't seem plausible that a hep cat like him, who could bag any "doll", "dame" or "mouse?", would fall for either of these gals. ---  --- Anyway, I gave it 2 stars because of Snuffy the dog.  He stole every scene he was in.  Although that wasn't too difficult to do in such a dog of a movie
We got this as an 11th birthday present for one of my daughter's friends.  It was the hit of the birthday party -- all the girls went home with new yarn belts, and my daughter, who can already knit a little, asked if she could have one, too.  The colors of yarn are bright and the texture is easy to work with.  For our purposes, this was a great birthday present
This is one fantastic grill. It is easy to ignite and heats up faster than Death Valley in July. Cleaning is easy with removable parts. For maximum effect, I suggest some type of grill cleaner to dissolve the carbonized left overs. That will make your BBQ look like new. There's some assembly required which took us about twice as long as the directions say it should, but once you taste your steaks and burgers, you will never be sorry you made the purchase.
This is a great beginner's guide to home buying.  The advice is straightforward and the explanations are easy to understand.  ---  --- Buying a home is a scary and daunting prospect for me.  I kept getting a lot of conflicting advice from relatives, friends, and coworkers on when to buy, what to buy, and how to buy.  This is very frustrating as everyone means well, but what worked for them might not apply to me. And don't bother asking a realtor or mortgage company if you should buy--they make their living on our decisions to buy!  ---  --- So I bought Home Buying for Dummies to learn more, and it has a lot of sound and thoughtful guidance to help decide when and how much to buy...  And also how to find a good home, and then negotiate with the realtors, the sellers, the mortgage companies, and everyone else that is sticking their hands in your wallet.   ---  --- The author's advice is realistic, and he points out the pitfalls of jumping in and what trouble you can get into with the different loan options out there
I gave my father-in-law a couple ideas for my son's (1 year old) Christmas gift and this was one of the items. Boy do I regret giving him this as an idea. It is a cheaply constructed toy. The bus's hood doesn't even work correctly. The toy does not do much of interest and it constantly makes this annoying noise! The toy held my son's attention for less than 5 minutes. My suggestion to anyone considering this toy is there are many more worthwhile toys on the market- skip this one
Patton Oswalt is funny and my two stars is not because of his performance. It's because of Comedy Central mangling the DVD version. ---  --- The show was originally broadcast on Comedy Central, and as such it was cut down to about 40 minutes so it could fill a one-hour time slot with commercials.  ---  --- The DVD has the original show, and then in the bonus section, it has "deleted scenes," which are the parts of the full-length concert that were cut for time.  ---  --- So, you can watch the time-edited show, or you can watch the out-of-context segments that were taken out. But what you can't do, and what I have to think any chimpanzee able to use sign language would know you would want to do, is see the original full-length show in its entirety. ---  --- So, cheers for Patton, boos for CC. I won't be buying the DVD and that's why.
Good special effects for that time period.  Served its purpose to boost the morale of the American public during 1943.  The heroic acts by those in the U.S. military at that time should always be remembered.  Outgunned and outmanned they held their own, and then some on Wake Island and in the Philippines. ---  --- However, the writers and producer play it pretty loose as far as historical accuracy was concerned.  No B-17s ever flew from Hawaii to Wake Island and on to Clark Field in the Philippines after the attack on Pearl.  I believe it is common knowledge that no B-17s ever sank the Japanese fleet advancing on the Philippines.  Remember Colin Kelly? ---  --- What was laughable was the scene where the Mary Ann makes an emergency landing on Maui instead of Hickam Field on Dec 7th.  Upon landing they're fired upon by local island Japanese.  Throughout the movie there are references to sabatoge committed by Japanese Americans in Hawaii on Dec 7th 1941.  Upon landing at Hickam Field ("because the Japs on Maui were shooting at us") a colonel goes on about Japanese vegetable trucks driving onto the runway at Hickam and crashing the tails of rows of P-40s before the attack.  Never happened.  In truth, there were no acts of sabatoge committed by the Japanese population in Hawaii.   ---  --- This movie only serves to perpetuate the common belief that Japanese-Americans were disloyal and unpatriotic citizens during WWII, when in fact this was not the case.  It should be noted that a good number of Japanese-Americans (many of whom were thrown into prison camps after Dec 7th) died fighting for the United States during WWII in order to prove their loyalty to this country. ---  --- May I suggest people watch the movie "Go For Broke" after watching Air Force to educate themselves on what "really" happened in WWII
We bought this item for my Daughter's Christmas present and the strings do not work at all.  All it does is play the 3 songs, and the microphone works.  But the other functions (anything to do with the strings) do not work at all.  We bought this at Toys R Us and we're taking it back tomorrow.  As I can see from the reviews (which I wish I'd read earlier), we'll be getting a different brand of guitar.  These seem faulty as a rule.  Do not buy this
Are they the best no.. Do they impress people who havent hear them before YES!! To me thats the best compliment, they are much more objective listeners --- with no preconcived notions. All I ever hear is " Those speakers sound so Good" " I love those cool little speakers" etc. I've played everything from Bach to Dio and they sound very realistic. Subwoofer placement is key to having the proper bass level. At [...] they are a steal.. I paid [...]in 1991 and listen to them everyday they still sound like they did when new.
I used to wear lame-ass Y-fronts when I was a kid and my boring folks did all the shopping. I made the switch to thongs after I got a girlfriend and she made it clear that I had to ditch the grandpa undies. So I did, and gladly! There's no way I could go back to this 'maxi' sh*t anymore. I tried one of my old pairs a few months ago and they look freakin HUGE!! I'm talking fat-guy big. You don't realize how big they are until you try modern stuff. So here's my advice: if you're still putting up with either boxers or briefs throw them in the trash right now and go buy something smaller. You'll be happy you did
I had great hope for this product.  It has, mostly, so far, lived up to my expectations.  Here are some caveats... ---  --- I was hoping for the ability to set up music catagories...easy listening, dinner music, light jazz...etc.  You have to "cheat" to do this, and using the manual is daunting.  Instead of using the "Artist" as artist, I used it as a catagory code, ie making one artist light jazz, etc.  This works, but you do, of course lose the artist registration ability. ---  --- So now, I can select "artist" "Dinner Music" and then "All Discs" and "Shuffle", and the unit will play a track from one "Dinner Music" CD then shuffle to another track on another "Dinner Music" CD, etc, making a delightful, mix of music that never is repeated exactly the same way. ---  --- I am still in the loading phase of coexistance with this machine, so longetivty, and flawlessness are not being reviewed here.  That remains to be seen. ---  --- The manual is purely awfull.  Just dig in and try things.  That's the only way to get a handle on things.  Hope this helps....good luck! --- 
This was very dissapointing!! my daughter was so excited to get it and could barely use it. the mat is supposed to be color coordinated with the screen however the colors seem to be all the same shade. The mat looks like it comes from the dollar store, or they ran out of color at the factory. My daughter asked her sister why mommy got this ugly one....not like the box or commercial!
im 14 and i go to school.... i bought this watch because I got a nice allowence and wow THE PEOPLE AT SCHOOL THINKS IM RICH AND COOL:!!!!!
eddie murphy is a comical guy, but is he really the right guy to play in something as stupid as this? Of course, who is the right guy for it? One of the questions i can't stand to think about in this movie, is how Dolittle hears the animals speak, but their lips move and nobody notices. Can't they connect the dots? Obviously not. And obviously, the filmmakers couldn't either
I purchased a package for window xp in may this year and just got a computer on which I wanted to use it. On Thursday Nov. 25, we wanted install it but the boot disk # 4 was observed to be problematic and thus the whole installation was not successful. ---  --- Please advice me. ---  --- Thanks  ---  --- Rev, Ndorle
I was excited to receive the product however it did not fit my laptop.  Everytime I opened the lid a POPPING sound would occur.  Turns out the rear right back panel was rubbing the lid casing.  I took the laptop out and placed it back in thinking it was not properly installed, same issue. ---  --- I'm not telling anyone not to buy this product.  Just be cautious.. and I hope you have better luck then I did
my review is written here only for seekers of obscure nine inch nails songs. for a full review of the soundtrack in its entirety read elsewhere-there are many other reviews. --- i have all 19 halos, and exclusive and unreleased remixes and demos, and i love all of it, including the entirety of the fragile, fixed, perfect drug versions, still, further down the spiral v1 and v2, the deluxe edition of the downward spiral, on and on, everything.... --- except deep. --- deep is truly the only nine inch nails song not worth having. --- painfully uninspired and recycled, musically, lyrically, and visually (the video was an embarassment- again, the only one in a catalogue of otherwise disturbing, beautiful brilliance), DEEP is a song and phase trent himself has admitted to wishing to forget entirely. --- my advice: take it as a mark that he is, after all, human, but leave it here on the tomb raider soundtrack, unpaid for, for it will never show up on an official halo as burn (originally for natural born killers), dead souls (joy division cover originally for the crow), and the perfect drug (originally for lost highway) all have in time (the former two on halo 8 DE and the latter on halos 11, 12, and 15 in extended form)
The glasses were in excellent condition, they were exactly what i expected plus more (they sent them in a glasses case which was a bonus to me.  This was an excellent seller
This movie combines two things I love in a film: ---  --- The actors are able to enjoy and showcase their talents. This is an --- improv lover's dream.  --- AND --- It makes fun of a topic which takes itself too seriously, in this --- case, dog shows. Only one character in the film keeps the importance of the dog's rating in context. ---  --- Mainly though, it is just hilarious. Some (okay-a lot) of the humor is too crude for my kids to see unfortunately, and nearly too crude for me. Still, it fits the genre.
I would call this the musical equivalent of the worst of abstract art.  There are those that "appreciate" unintelligable works for fear of being thought stupid if they don't . . . just as the emporer's subjects "Ooh"ed and "Ah"ed in admiration of his clothing as he paraded naked in front of them
Pull ups are NOT very good for potty training, they are for parents who are too lazy to take their kids to the bathroom.  Potty training does not include using diapers.  That is what these are is fancy diapers.  If you want to potty train your kids put them in real underwear or training pants with a plastic cover on them.  The wetness liner is a joke.  These also give kids the impression that if they do not want to go to the bathroom they can just go in their pants
I would have to agree with the problem of the dividers to separate the dates, it just doesn't work. I didn't send it back because it really goes with my desk and I do like the two small drawers. Maybe I can fit some nice flowers or a decorative tissue box or something in the top bin and place mail somewhere else. I wouldn't have put my name on this thing. Does anyone out there need extra plastic dividers for this thing? You can have mine.
The ToshibaMD14F52 arrived defective. Some channels would not function properly - ghost images and snow on screen. We have direct connect cable with 5 other TVs that work perfectly. Toshiba customer service was horrible to deal with; they were evasive,would not listen to my explanations but insisted on telling me to try what I had already tried to make the TV work. They also told me to call my cable company for help. Finally, after talking to several different unhelpful and unfriendly Toshiba people, I was referred to a TV repair agent for Toshiba that turned out to be unsavory, dishonest, given to lying and refusing to demonstrate he had fixed the TV as he claimed. He refused to plug it in to show it worked. Well, as I suspected, when I got home and tried the TV, he had left the TV as non-functional as it was when he received it, but insisted it was fixed. He told me to buy an external TV antenna and not use my cable TV! I will never buy another Toshiba TV again
I thought this salt tasted pretty good until it occurred to me I go to the bathroom everytime I take a swim
I'm a big Koontz fan and as is generally the case, I greatly enjoyed this story.  It was a little strange but that's to be expected from this author and genre.  That said, it starts off fairly quickly and flows well through most of the book.  It had the curious sense of near-division in that the book almost seemed to be separated into two distinct sections that were not, in my opionion, as well-connected as in many of Koontz's other books.  In addition, the ending seemed a little hasty.  Thus I gave it four rather than five stars.  That said, I would gladly recommend it to a friend as I would most any of this author's work
I saw this movie and was shocked at the contents, considering that it was aimed at children. It starts out with the gypsy Esmeralda doing a very provocative stripper style pole dance. While no stripping happened, there wasn't much other difference in the style of dance. Later in the movie, one of the men is obsessing over her in a manner I would never want my children to see. He sings a song about how she will burn in hell if he doesn't have her, and meanwhile a vision of her provocative dancing is playing out in the flames of a fire. Regardless of the rest of the movie, these two scenes make this highly innapropriate for children. Not to mention that the story is very untrue to the novel, which had a tragic ending rather than a happy ever after one.
First, I'd just like to correct the person who said that moleskines have "no actual historical legacy". The Moleskine company may not have been founded until 1992, but moleskine notebooks have been around since before that. The company is not saying that Hemingway, Picasso and Chatwin used their brand of notebooks, they are saying that those people used moleskines. ---  --- But the great thing about these notebooks is not that famous people used them, but that they are of great quality. I highly recommend them
These steaks dribble like a basketball and shoot like a dream. They should include a backboard, rim, and net with these. And some cheerleaders wouldn't hurt, either
Waste of money, the manual doesn't have proper instructions, and settings buttons also not working as per the manual, I don't know its fault with the manual or button settings, I struggled for a week and returned this item
  DIS GY IS DA KYING OF DA SOUTH!!!  ---  --- Give me a f***ing break. When are we going to stop seeing crappy rapper after even crappier rappers that are so full of themselves that they feel the need to plasture their faces all over every one of their crappy unintelligent so called albums!! Nothing descent to say at all, just a bunch of mindless [...]. I bet you they don't even like music, they just want to be a "celebrity"  and be rich for 3 years(till their broke). If they really did geniunly like music, it wouldn't sound that sh**y!!!! GET OVER YOURSELVES!!! 
I love dogs but if I had wanted to know the ins and outs of dog obedience training, including the different levels snd sub-levels, I would have bought a manual. I wanted a mystery with fully fleshed out characters and a plot that kept me guessing. I got neither. The characters were neither likeable nor substantive. Except for the cop next door, I have no idea what they even look like or what, if anything, they care about besides dogs. The plot was predictable and the action stuck in first gear. Maybe the series inmproves after this book. I'm not taking that chance
My little cockapoo loves Newman's Own dog treats, especially the peanut butter flavor. She'll usually eat anything, but I feel better about giving her treats that are healthy, organic, and made with high-quality ingredients that I could eat. No by-products here! Great price & highly recommended
These have been my favorite cookies for over 20 years now, both in New York & California.  I just love the shortbread and the fudgy center and have never found another cookie that even compares. --- Recently I moved to the Southeast, tho, and panicked when I couldn't find any Stella D'oro cookies anywhere! I'm so happy to find them here at Amazon, where I'm a regular shopper anyway; now I can add them to my order everytime I buy something!
My 4 year son is learning about the fragility of life the hard way with this tank. --- Two Goldfish, two flushes. If I take the struggling fish out of the tank and put it in a fish bowl it seems to come around, but they won't last 24 hours in this tank. I've followed the directions to a T, Adjusted the pH, tried lights on lights off, pump on pump off, even used bottled water, but the fish just do a slow fade when in the tank
Radio Shack wanted $39.95 for a similar item so at $9.95 this was a steal - swr is good and performance is as much as I need for Corvette runs although it hears well and gives a good transmit signal for the small size far beyond what I need.  I did have to put a metal plate on the Vette (discreetly) as it wouldn't stick to the fiberglass.  Good produc
This was a replacement clock for one that fell off the kitchen wall. I was very familiar with this clock since I had the original one for almost 3 years. I like the look of this clock and I like the choices you have for different displays. Overall this is a sweet clock. I did not however give this clock 5 stars because when you try and "program" this clock it won't do what you want it to do, not sure if it how the owners manual is written, or whether the manual is out of date with changes in how to adjust the features
Okay, first off, I'd like to say that this is my first AF SLR--I stepped up from my dinosaur of a camera, Canon AE-1 manual focus, and right now I am quite overwhelmed by all the features in this little thing.  I'm still in the learning stages of all this technology but let me tell you this, I am having fun!  It amazes me that Canon can offer quite an impressive camera for the price.   ---  --- I just received my first few rolls from the developer and the pictures came out amazing--so clear and the colors are very vibrant.  Just to let you know, I'm using the 28-105mm f/3.5-4.5 USM lens.  I took the suggestions of many and passed up on the "kit" lens and I'm sure glad I did so.  I would highly recommend the f/3.5-4.5 lens, but unfortunately for the rest of you, Amazon has discontinued it.  But you could order it from one of the many other photo shops (B&H, Adorama, etc).  ---  --- Do I have any regrets on this purchase?  Absolutely not!  I love this camera and even though I've owned it for less than a month, I'm actually thinking about stepping up to the EOS 3 and using this as a backpacking/hiking body.  Hmm...what to do, what to do?  Do I purchase another body or start a collection of L-series glass?  ...that is the question. ---  ---  --- 
I bought this shaver last September, and at that point I agreed with the other reviewers. It delivered a nick-free shave and was quick and painless to use. This past May, it stopped being able to re-charge and just died completely. I only used the recommended cleaning solution, changed it according to the instructions, and cleaned it after every use. I sent the shaver back to Remington, they were very nice and sent a new replacement shaver after a few weeks. It worked wonderfully, for about 2 months when the same problem occurred again! I'm sending it back again and hoping for a refund this time, it isn't worth my time and money to go to the post office every few months to return yet another defective shaver!
Judging from the picture, I thought this thing looked like a turban!  It actually has no wrapped fabric, but is a firmly fitting cap.  Hidden in the back is an elastic band that will adjust for larger heads, which is attached to the edges of an ugly looking triangular gap.  Aside from this, the coloring is too bold.  Old Glory will select random coloration for each customer, but my selection has over twice the color variety as the one in the picture!  I don't see how I can wear it without attracting stares
I have to admit that, at first listening, I found some aspects of Ms.Belle's interpretations of these pieces disorienting. However, as I listened to these covers repeatedly, I can now say that I understand better what the vocalist is after. Not that I always agree with her and with George Duke,the arranger/producer, but I agree with their choices and their totally new project and enjoy having had my horizons broadened.  --- Ms.Belle has immense talent, superb technique, and a clear idea of each piece, and she delivers the goods without faltering or compromise. I admire that a lot in a performer. Her choices ask us for a reaction and we are free to accept or reject what she has offered us. When I first heard these renditions, I was quite stand-offish, but over time I have come to appreciate them more and more - almost to the point of addiction - and am grateful to Regina and George for their strength of conviction as well as their superior musicianship.They do NOT want us to listen in a passive way, they are waiting for our reaction..and God, this is really so,so good....That's the true spirit in which an album should be recorded.  --- I'd encourage you to get this album because it is about strong, powerful and personal interpretations of some great jazz standards by Regina. You may love everything about it, or you may reject aspects of her interpretations. But in any case you will not remain indifferent; you will be enriched by hearing these pieces in a clear and beautifully personal way. That is an important aspect of why I love this imaginative, innovative quality music and why this recording is invaluable.  --- And it cannot be said enough that her backing band is incredible, giving this album the necessary push to take it over the edge. It is a success because it skilfully avoids being categorized. Regina has had the courage to break out of the traditional mould and make a successful cross-over, which some purists may not approve of...  --- Only time will tell....
I bought this toy for my four year old for Christmas thinking it would be the perfect toy for her since she loves Care Bears and she loves the game hide and seek. This toy was a big disappointment! She was so excited when she opened the package but when we tried to play with it, she got frustrated and lost intrest very quickly. The Care Bear "finder" does not give good clues to where the Care Bear is hiding and makes it very confusing for a child. It was saying "come find me" even when she was within a couple feet of it and she had to be right on top of it before it would tell her that she's "getting warmer." It doesn't let the child know that they are getting close to it until they can see it. My daughter gave up on it quickly because she would be wandering the house aimlessly without any clue as to it's where abouts. I do not recommend this toy to any one. I would have given it no stars, but she does like the bear itself. Do yourself a favor...buy a care bear (much cheaper), hide it somewhere, and you can truthfully tell your child when they are "getting warmer!
Having so much enjoyed the first two volumnes in this series, I was not prepared for this turgid list of self improvement. Yes Clive is well read, English and Italian, yes he does know the difference between a Donatello and a Michelangelo, but do we need to know every book he read in the two years, every painting he saw and how it moved him. The simple answer is no. Unfortunately it takes 250 pages to find out. --- The story of how a drunken extemely funny youth becomes a sober mildly funny old pseud
I admit that I tried to read this twice and failed both times.  I got to around page 20 or so.  I'll probably try again.  However, if you're an adult who has already read other philosophies I would suggest attempting to read it just so you'll know what Objectivism is about.  I wouldn't suggest it for teens that haven't had any prior readings, though.  Objectivism is about the self and about "reason", and it can be heady stuff for someone who has no real experience in anything else.  ---  --- The strange thing about the tone of the writing is that it comes across as venomous.  I assume that's in my head, but judge for yourself.  Her caricatures of "The Witch Doctor" (who controls others from a spiritual perspective) and "Attila" (who controls by brute force) are actually interesting.  Wrong, but interesting.  Since Objectivists rely on reason alone for their survival (or think they do, anyway), it's rather surprising the lack of logical thinking early in the book. ---  --- My suggestion is to attempt to read it without dismissing her out of hand (she's not wrong on everything), or swallowing it all without using your own critical thinking skills. Judging by previous reviews, it seems there were plenty of both kinds of readers. ---  --- If you buy into it, you can get a feeling of superiority over others in a kind of pseudo-intellectual way.  If you don't buy into it, however, you're evil (either the Witch Doctor or Attila) and probably just too stupid to "get it".   ---  --- Why I didn't finish it yet... --- I just couldn't get past her ignorance of history, frankly.   If you're writing a work of fiction, the historical innacuracies don't matter, but this isn't supposed to be fiction.  I like history and most people don't, so it probably won't bother most people.  --- Also, while she denounces religion, Ms. Rand has no problem hopping up to the pulpit herself.  Like all other religions and cults, the world is messed up basically because people don't think like she does. 
...in the beginnig of the 1930's, the Turks would have succeeded in making the whole world forget about the Armenian genocide that took place in 1915/16. ---   ---  Turkey did succeed in putting pressure on the US-government in 1933 though, when a movie was supposed to be made based on this book, so the then US-government again put pressure on MGM not to make this movie. A foreign government coerced censorship in the Unites States: Just imagine that! I hope the the making of the movie
Some of Patterson's conclusions were a bit of a reach. --- Some of his segways weren't all that smooth. --- But this book is just plain entertaining. It is chopped full of stories on rockstars making deals with the Devil,lingering around after death, and backed up with just enough innuendo-ish research for it to almost be believable. Well, some of it actually believable. Patterson scribes on about various rockstar-occult alliances (in particular the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin) and uses quotes from the musicians themselves. --- 
I won't claim to be a professional food taster ... I just know what I like and don't like.  I don't like "yellow" popcorn, I don't like microwave popcorn, I like the "white" popcorn cooked in a pan.  For my "popping style" the Baby White pops great w/o lots of hard kernels.  'nuf said
MARIA MONTEZ, JON HALL and SABU made some very entertaining Technicolor "sand and sandals" epics at Universal and this DVD restoration showcases them in brilliant Technicolor. ---  --- It's strictly Saturday afternoon matinee stuff, nothing to really ponder in the way of complex plots--just the usual good vs. evil with Hall coming to the rescue of beautiful princess Montez in her usual damsel in distress kind of role.  ---  --- Exquisitely photographed on desert sands, it's exotic fun fare for adults and children with lots of eye candy to keep things interesting. TURHAN BEY is effective in a brief role but it's Montez and Hall who keep the story moving along at a lively pace. Well worth viewing and nostalgic fun for fans of the Universal series starring this trio of stars
Summary:  --- I wasted a lot of time trying to make this work, and I eventually went back to other products.   ---  --- In theory, integrating virus checker, firewall, spyware, and data backup into a unified suite (like MS Office with Word, Excel, & PowerPoint) makes sense.  However, this software package seems poorly made; it did not work very well for me.   ---  --- Hardware, OS, & primary software used:  --- 1.  Dell Lattitude D620 Laptop with 2GB RAM, Windows XP, MS Office --- 2.  Dell X1 Laptop (thin/lightweight) with 2GB RAM, Windows XP, MS Office --- 3.  Dell Dimension Desktop with 4 GB RAM, Windows XP, children's games ---  --- Prior virus/spyware products:  --- Lattitude & X1: Norton --- Dimension: freeware provided by our ISP ---  --- Theory:  Since Microsoft makes the OS & office applications that get infected with viruses, their product should be better integrated with the OS.  There will be synergy by integrating several related software applications.   ---  --- Lesson:  --- Well, after a series of terrible experiences, I hope others will benefit from my wasted time:  ---  --- 1.  Instead of loading most of the program from the CD & downloading small updates, this seems to load only a small part of the program and downloads huge files.  This made me feel that the product was shipped unfinished.  You had to do this separately for each machine since it hides the downloaded files then deletes them prior to finishing the installation.  This took a better part of an afternoon.   ---  --- 2.  I purchased a 3-pack license.  Installing and activating the software on the 2nd & 3rd machines required a series of very annoying steps that involved logging into their website with broken links.  It finally required a phone call.  At least, the phone support experience was good.  ---  --- 3.  The product promises to minimize performance impact, and improve overall performance.  On the Lattitude & Dimension (powerful machines), there was no difference in performance, but we could notice a slightly slower performance with the X1.  This was later verified when we uninstalled the MS Windows OneCare and replaced it with another product.   ---  --- 4.  The product has difficulty updating.  It opens a small message box that asks you to click to update OneCare, but that takes you to a webpage that only works about 1 in 4 times.   ---  --- 5.  Except for the first time, data backup always has several errors that I have to manually fix.  This has very rarely happened with other data backup software I've used.   ---  --- 6.  Some applications, the firewall asks everytime for permission to connect to the Internet although the application is in the list to always allow this connection. 
I never write reviews, but I had to make my comments on these socks. I bought them to keep my feet warm at me desk at work.  I put them on and turned the switch to high.  They DO NOT EVEN GET WARM at all...I thought it was broken, but realized it was both socks that didn't get warm. These are a total rip off and I am going to try and send them back. 
I received my Valeo Ocelot training "glove", still waiting for the other.  Bubble pack had only one glove in it.  Amazon HELP has no concept of partial shipment
I received an email from txshirts stated that I should direct all inquiries to csr@txshirts.com. I did this on two occasions and received no reply. Customer service finally contacted me only to ask why I had left negative feedback on Amazon. They stated they never received any email from me. ---  --- Their gym shorts were not as described. The description said "covered elastic waistband". Instead, I received an "uncovered" elastic waistband that digs into my skin and leaves indentations on my skin.  ---  --- Their response? I should pay for return shipping in order to get my money back. ---  --- But who should pay for return shipping when an item is falsely advertised??
This shaver is ok but has an electronic problem. I get clean shave with little bit of effort but, My main problem is with ON/OFF button. Just after using this for 3-4 months my shaver ON/OFF button stopped working.  It is always in ON position I can't switch off the razor. The only way it switches off is when the battery runs out
I made the mistake of buying a two-year subscription.  Every upgrade slows the product down.  A scan that used to take 14 minutes now takes over one hour. Stay away from this junk--there are much better free products available
Read out my OBDII error code with a one-line description and allowed me to reset it.  No problem
Perhaps a age group should be posted as with most toy sellers.  I bought it for my 4 year old nephew and it's worthless to anyone other than I guess stores who like to stick star war stickers on the retail counters.  It is deceiving and the retailer is arrogant and would not even consider a return since it was opened to see what it was.  Avoid this retailer and it's products
My son picked out these shoes for basketball. He liked them at first and gave them time to get broke-in, but the outsides of the shoes had no give. Most shoe will form to your foot, these did not. At the end of third stripe, you could feel a big ridge on the inside of the shoe.We had to buy a different pair of shoes that formed to his foot better. Nice looking shoe, but not the greatest fit
These are the only semi-affordable bikini briefs I've found that are actually designed with a "pouch", making them the most comfortable on the market (of all the brands I've tried, that is). Unfortunately, they're difficult to locate in typical retail outlets, and you'll probably have to purchase them from an Amazon outlet that has exorbitant shipping charges, but what can I say. I guess it's worth it. ---  --- The briefs also run about a size small. I have a 31" waist but the mediums are too small.
The Miernik Dossier was shockingly good. Before this, I had never read anything by McCarry. In fact, I had never even heard the man's name. I was lucky to come across a review of this re-issued work in a magazine. Now I am collecting everything by him. ---  --- The story follows an odd assortment of people, some of whom may or may not be intelligence agents, as they travel south through Europe into Africa. For the entire length of the book you will be wondering and guessing and probably changing your mind many times as to who is working against whom and trying to figure out if Miernik is who he says he is. The writers of the dossier themselves seem to be unsure. In that sense the Miernik Dossier has similar elements to a mystery or detective novel, but yet it goes way beyond that. It is also a highly compelling character study, with each of the group drawn intricately by the author so that you come to know the characters. This makes it all the more suspenseful because these people who you seem to know or possibly identify with in some way may very well not be who you think they are. ---  --- The Miernik Dossier is a highly entertaining read. True spy literature, in the vein of Ashenden, that is enjoyable for those who enjoy spy stories, mysteries or simply great writing. I cannot wait to read this book again
Ahhhh, what a great movie.  I cry at the end every time.  I remember when I was young and prayed for the safe return of the astronauts of Apollo 13.  However, I am SEVERELY dissappointed with the widescreen DVD.  Those who created it did not use the original film, but chopped top and bottom from the fullscreen VHS version.  There are many instances when this is evident, but the most glaring is the scene in the back yard of the Lovell house after the walk on the moon when Jim says, "I want to go back there".  When the scene opens, he is cut off at mid-thigh and you never see below his knees. On the fullscreen VHS you can see his shoes.  When I buy the widescreen, I want the WHOLE movie, not less than the fullscreen VHS tape.  Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.  Buy the VHS
My first objective was to find an alarm clock with a programmable snooze -- this one's got it.  Second objective was to be large enough for day-to-day use but also useable for travelling -- this one does it. ---  --- The projection feature works great for me -- it's razor sharp and even at it's lowest setting very clear.  If you can't see it in the day time, look at he front of the clock (which can also be lit by LEDs by pushing any one button). ---  --- Yes, the buttons are not the sturdiest, but I believe that the need to use them often is negated by the fact it is radio-controlled.  You set the alarm and display preference once and you walk away. ---  --- For a $20.00 alarm clock, I think it's a fantastic value
This was a really dissapointing remake of the great adventure story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It didn't really seem to follow the original novel other than the names of the lead characters. The plot and scripting are  incredibly weak, it seems the editors just stopped mid-movie and rolled the  credits there. The CGI dinosaurs' appearances were impressive but their  animation was very stiff. In my opinion, not worth the $83 it costs
This cable is tooooooo cooooooool when you play multy-player on Final Fantas
This is the best bed rail if you DO NOT have a box spring. My 2 year old recently moved into his toddler bed and I purchased this rail because he has a "bunkie" board instead of a box spring. The length is satisfactory, and the fold-down mechanism is perfect because of the raised hinges. It is easy to make the bed as well. We also purchased it for the grandparent's house because they have a platform bed. It works equally as well. My only complaint is that maybe the rail isn't high enough but my son hasn't been tempted to climb over it. I would recommend this bed rail for a good transition to a "big boy" bed that doesn't have a box spring (although the manufacturer recommends it)
This is the first episode where we really see the heart of Tony in his dealings with a teenager struggling with the horrible death of his father. A must see
Wow, I just viewed "Spun" the other night and I thought this movie was outrageous. This is sort of a guilt-pleasure movie but you want to take shower afterwards. ---  ---  "Spun" has an impressive cast of recognized actors. The film is, essentially, about a few days in the lives of a group of drug addicts. There is The Cook (Mickey Rourke, he truly makes this story worth watching), who makes the drug (speed) and sells it to Spider Mike (John Leguizamo), a dealer with a junkie girlfriend, Cookie (Mena Suvari, looking infinitely less attractive than she did in "American Beauty"). One of his clients is Ross (Jason Schwartzman), who does a lot of favours for The Cook and his girlfriend, Nikki (Brittany Murphy).  ---  ---  I was surprised at how funny the film was at times. It doesn't drown us in anti-drug messages, nor does it become one of those, equally tedious, drug films where you feel like the sober driver at a drunken party. The humour is dark, certainly, but funny nevertheless. A lot of it comes from a subplot about Frisbee, Patrick Fugit,  who is caught by a couple of TV policemen (Peter Stormare and Alexis Arquette) and is told he will be let off if he helps them get Spider-Mike. I will only say of the resulting sequence that he does it with all the subtlety of an undercover policeman with his badge stuck to his forehead. ---  --- This is a film with a lot of energy, that seems, like its characters, not entirely sure where it is going, but determined to get there, and quickly. Although I am sure it is boring to be surrounded by people on speed when you are sober, this film almost makes you feel like you are on speed too. The director, Jonas ï¿½kerlund, has directed music videos in the past, and it shows in his impatient filming style, as he plays around with animation, speeded-up camerawork and such like. ---  --- I'm not recommending the film for its style though, although I am sure it is the best way this material could get to the screen. I am recommending it because I liked the main characters, which I think will stick in my head for much longer than the animated sex scenes or the split screens. I can imagine an entire film about The Cook and Nikki, or Spider Mike and Cookie, or even just Ross, who absentmindedly keeps leaving a girl handcuffed to his bed for hours/days. What makes "Spun" better than those hypothetical films is that it puts the characters into their own little community, and we feel as if we are watching their everyday, speeded up, sleepless lives. Simply amazing. --- 
I have my own business so I decided to give back to community by assisting with Christmas for the unfortunate.  I purchased 7 Amazing Allysen dolls and a plethora of other stuff for the less fortunate.  None of the Allysen dolls work.  I purchased a Amazing Allysen for my little in cousin in Florida also. We tried to make that doll work but it would not.  I went to the local Walmart to purchase another one and it did not work either.  I am totally disappointed with Amazing Allysen.  The kids that I purchased the doll for in Raleigh North Carolina could not find the appropriate things so that I could return the dolls.  I will return the one I purchased for my cousin today because my 30 days are almost up.  This was a horrible experience.  Those kids were expecting to have a super awesome doll, but she did not work.  I felt so bad because it was like I had something to do with it because I purchased so many and none of them worked.  I did have the opportunity to return the doll to Walmart in Florida and purchased an Amanda doll for my little cousin after Christmas.  She really loves Amanda
Suspenseful erotic thriller with Neve Campbell, Matt Dillon, Kevin Bacon and Denise Richards. Has the teacher Sam Lombardo raped his pupil Kelly Van Ryan? Or does the spoilt gal want revenge for being rejected? The movie with the many twists and turns. Brilliant story. The resolution only comes in the final credits
There is little more I can contribute to this literary masterpiece--even though the essential structure of my review is clear in my mind, it will not be able to truly capture the magnificent splendor of this work. Gustave Flaubert was a conscientious literary artist who revised and perfected Madame Bovary with care. He worked on the novel for nearly six years, during which time he rewrote the manuscript several times, often spending days perfecting a single paragraph. The result of his painstaking creativity was a masterpiece that rivals the heavens with its beauty. Madame Bovary is a penetrating psychological study of its heroine, Emma Bovary, as she struggles to find fulfillment through a realization of her romantic fantasies of love and wealth. She exists in a dream world and longs for freedom from her middle-class humdrum lifestyle. Flaubert's realistic portrait of the tragic fate of this complex woman is nothing short of phenomenal. ---  --- In perfect contrast to Emma, Flaubert introduces Charles Bovary, a proto-typical doctor who has no real talent or ambition and is content to enjoy the simple things that life has to offer. Soon after their wedding, Emma becomes disillusioned by the bumbling Charles and yearns for a romantic interlude. Flaubert represents the absolute clichï¿½ of provincial life with his portrayal of this undemanding, unimpressive, and unnoticed middle-class man. Flaubert brings all facets of human personas full-circle with the shy, well-mannered, and well-liked young man-next-door, Leon. With a slow-blossoming relationship with Emma, Leon leaves for Paris to study law. Upon his return--and with a little experience--the two become lovers. Flaubert's portrayal of this dysfunctional couple is reminiscent of tragic romances of yore. Thereafter, the degeneracy of Emma's lifestyle is evident, and she is brought to the brink of destruction. ---  --- In Madame Bovary, Gustave Flaubert gives us a vivid and life-like glance into the reality and the mannerisms and the customs of small-town people living in France during the mid-nineteenth-century. Flaubert's descriptions are detailed and beautiful--and paint a real portrait of the natural world he is describing. Opening with first-person narration that sometimes shifts to third-person has earned Gustave Flaubert the reputation as one of the most celebrated and influential novelists of the nineteenth century
I love the pod idea...makes cleaning so much easier. This is perfect for a quick shot of espresso after dinner. Excellent
People will no doubt find the Nintendo DS Lite to be a way for Nintendo to sucker people out of their money. It can be that way, if you think of yourself as a sucker, but for me the DS lite is a little better. Simply put, if you're content with your original DS, then don't even waste time to buy this one. If you don't have a DS period, the DS Lite is a much better investment than the original bulky one. ---  --- With the DS Lite, gameplay is made a little simplar. The button placement and brighter screen make the gameplay a little better. For one, the start and select buttons have been moved to resemble where they were on the original Gameboy Advance. This makes handling some of the functions (especially for GBA games) a lot easier. The buttons, sadly, are a still a little small for guys with big hands like myself. ---  --- The DS Lite also comes with a phony GBA cartridge (called a "cap"). If you don't have a GBA game plugged into the system, you can put in the phony cartridge to keep it from collecting dust in there. However, when you do stick in a GBA game, it sticks out by about a centimeter. It just looks weird. The cap does, at least, keep the system looking good. ---  --- Perhaps the most welcome change to the DS Lite is the screen. The original DS screen was not exactly bright. In fact, it was, in comparison the DS Lite, rather dark. Games like Metroid Prime Hunters were darker than they had to be. On this new screen, the difference in how bright the games appear really shows. Not only that but, you can adjust the brightness if need be. It doesn't really affect the battery life, either. You can play the DS Lite for as long as you played the original. And also like the original, it charges while you play. ---  --- Another welcome difference is the touch screen itself. These screens last a lot longer than the original DS. Those who have an original DS no doubt experienced a lot of scratches on their screen from their stylus. To the point where it was noticeable. You could still see the screen, but it was apparent that the stylus was doing a number on it. The screen is more protected here. The stylus doesn't scratch the screen quite as easily. In other words, the touch screen lasts a lot longer. ---  --- The DS Lite also looks better, and fits in your pocket better. It also performs all the tasks of a regular DS. For example, if you're playing a game and you suddenly have to go, just flip it closed and it sleeps. There's also a place to store the stylus, and the stylus is better too. It's a little bigger and thicker, so it's not quite as easy to lose. ---  --- Some problems with the original DS still plague the DS Lite however. You still can't play Gameboy Color or regular Gameboy games on the DS Lite. Also, you still can't configure the controls to play a GBA game much easier. In other words you can't configure "X" and "Y" when you play a GBA game. This probably won't bother you in the long run, however. Also, the touch screen still has its sensitivity. Touching the touch screen with your bare hands is more dangerous than the stylus scratching the screen. The oils from your fingers might damage the screen and therefore, it won't respond to the touch of even your stylus. ---  --- When the original DS launched, owners will note that there were not very many good games availible. About the only good game during its launch in 2004 was Super Mario 64 DS. Now there are plenty of games out there (and not all of them are ports), so if you do want a DS, this is a great time to get one, and the DS Lite is a better investment than the original one by far. ---  --- The DS may not play movies, or MP3 players, but to be honest, that almost defeats the purpose of a gaming system. Am I looking to buy a portable entertainment center? Of course not, I'm looking to find a system to play some of my games on, and the Nintendo DS delivers. Real gamers know it's about the games, not about the bells and whistles of a system. For the casual gamer, the Nintendo DS delivers, and the DS Lite is a fine improvement. ---  --- The Good --- +Vastly superior to the original DS --- +It fits in your pocket easier --- +The Screen is much brighter --- +Touch screen is more durable --- +The placement of the Start and Select buttons is easier --- +A better stylus --- +The battery life is unchanged ---  --- The Bad --- -Those with an original DS, who want a DS Lite will have to spend more money for yet another DS --- -Some of the cons of the original DS are still her
After reviewing some of the other devices to hold the iPod Mini in place while exercising, selected the Armband Carrier. It more than adequately fills the bill of what I was looking for. Occassionally, you might have to adjust the tension on the armband to keep it from slipping down your arm, but it holds the iPod firmly in place. It can cause some chaffing if you wear a sleeveless shirt if you walk or run with the device. If you sweat a great deal while you exercise, I would advise removing the iPod from the holder after you complete your routine. Would recommend it to anyone who asks
I bought this for my wife when her Sonicare died. She loves it. Great price. She didn't want the better one and is very happy with it. Her teeth look great and she likes the way they feel after brushing
Casino Player is the end-all magazine for the serious gambler (and the gambler who likes weekend fun with lots of comps!).  It is one of the pricier magazines, but the cost is well worth it, and it isn't over-run with advertising.   ---  --- The letters to the editor touch on basic gaming, slot, and comp questions, and I always glean useful information from the Q&A section.  The magazine content covers slot machines, video poker strategy and probability, table game strategy and expected pay-offs, investing in the gaming industry's publicly-held corporations, and reviews of properties, restaurants, and shows.  I always read it before heading to Vegas to learn what is new and happening on the Strip and in the area. ---  --- Casino Player provides balanced coverage of Vegas, Atlantic City, Indian properties, and riverboat casinos.  As a Southern CA native, I usually skim features outside Vegas, but the magazine should be commended for reaching out to gamblers in all parts of the country
Someone posted below that they don't receive all their issues.  I have never failed to receive an issue.  I suspect someone is making off with this person's copies. ---  --- This is an elegant magazine, worthy of Martha.  If they cover a topic, you will know all there is to know about that topic.  The recipes are little gems, and I like the pullout recipe cards so they can be easily saved. ---  --- It's a little oasis of calm in a frentic world. ---  --- I do miss Martha's column of reminiscences, and wish that was back in the magazine
jorge sanz (a looker) stars as a soldier deserting from the spanish army during the 1930s civil wars, taken into a family, who proceeds to fall in love with and seduce all four daughters, while forging a father/son relationship with the patriarch. touching and kinky and off beat, a worthy winner of the oscar as best foreign language film in 1992.
This is the greatest product.  They stick to every restaurant table I have ever secured them to, are lightweight, easy to pack and fun for my daughter to look at.  Every time I pull one out of the diaper bag she says "Elmo, Elmo, Elmo".  They keep the germs away from her and the clean up is so simple.  I wouldn't do without them, they are great
I've always liked Tevin Campbell, he had a beautiful voice and really did it on "Break it Down". I particularly like Break it Down, Shhh, Brown Eyed Girl among others.. Excellent CD overall. 
I love this nativity even though it I think it is pricey.  There are no other ones like it.  They are Fisher Price Little People so you know they will hold up forever!  There aren't any other plastic nativity sets out there. Get the set that plays the song when you place the angel on top of the stable. It is so worth the price when you know they will play with it every year. I even take this to church when I teach my 3and4yr old class about Jesus birth.  They LOVE it
I found this title messing around adding things to my wish list.  I only read the blurb on Amazon enough to see Haitian Creaole listed as one of the languages.  Today updating my wish list I took extra time to find out why this was rated so low since nearly every thing on my list is 4 stars or more!  How unfortunate to find out that others before me made the mistake I almost made buying this in hopes of it having Haitian Creole!  Very disappointing!!!!  The makers should be ashamed
The only outdoor BBQ thermometer that I could find with a lighted digital readout. Easy to see in the dim light outside at the BBQ. Reliable -accurate -and easy to use -at an affordable pric
This headset has a major flaw - the connections between the headset and phone are full of static.  The other parties don't hear it, but their voice is  constantly zapped by the static, and I'm asking them to repeat themselves. I've compared it with a couple other headsets I've got, and they don't have this problem in the same locations.  Actually, this headset has static problems ANYWHERE - office, car, out walking, you name it. ---  --- Do yourself a favor and avoid this one
This product come with a washer that keep causing the leak. It works fine for few weeks then the washer become worn out and it keep causing the leak. Now I just leave it in my garage and can't return it or use it. very bad investment
About three years ago, maybe four, I bought two Lexar CFII cards. One never worked, the other worked, but lost all data. I wrote to Lexar, that I had two bad cards, they sent me one new card of the same size. I gave that to my girlfriend & told her to only use it on pix she didn't care about losing. I still have my card, in a ziplock. None of the file removal programs will get the images off, & I've used all of them, & had their (file removal) tech help give up. ---  --- In this day & age of "just make the item" I am upset. But you take your chances. Do you want the only picture of your great grand-mother lost because you used a Lexar? I wouldn't, I use an actual sandisk card, myself. ---  --- If they ever (Lexar) made it right, I may have written a better review, but they haven't. So that tells me that they don't care. ---  --- How important are your pictures to you? ---  ---  --- Frederic
These teas (both the raspberry and the blueberry) are priced lower than in the grocery store ($3.49 per individual box), where they are usually a seasonal item. This is frustrating since my husband and I are hooked on them and probably brew and drink a full pitcher per day.  They are the best tasting cold ice teas and great for the antioxidant benefits.  This seller shipped them promptly and they were very well packed.  We will be a repeat buyer for sure.  A+!!!!!!!!!!!
Much longer lasting than the standard battery.  Fast shipping
The sugar was perfect, I ordered it to go on a cookie I make only at Christmas time.  The cookie is an almond flavored one that you make by chiliing the dough and then cutting off a small piece which you make into a ball and then roll by hand out so it is about 9 inches long.  You try to keept it a little thicker in the very middle so when you twist it, it has a tapered look.  You leave the top with a small opening so you can put a pretty ribbon thru it like it can be hung on the tree.  When they are cooked and still warm you put a thin coating on them of powdered sugar and almond flavoring and water and when they are still sticky, you sprinkle the sugar on.  They came out beautiful, I then put them in an old cookie tin and serve them up to company, they think I am soooooo talented and it is so easy
Rhymefest is an Ok rapper and the first two joints are bumping. Man, I thought I was in for a classic hip hop album , It was like the Lakers were --- ahead by 30 points then all of a sudden the other team caught up and eventually won the game because after that it was just wack track after wack track. I admire his thought provoking lyrics but if the beat ain't hittin I could care less what you're rapping about. Rhymefest used so many R&B singers I thought I was listening to some old New Edition or After 7 joints not that I don't like those singers but I don't want to hear that on no hip hop album. If you want to hear some real Chicago hip hop check out All Natural the best besides Common to ever come from the city of wind
I purchased this item because of the trustworthy name and cordless feature. The positive reviews here are from first impressions. However, I have had this clipper close to a year but with probably less then 5 hours use. When I first received it, it felt very light and cheaply made. I gave it the benifit of the doubt and hoped for the best. Last time it worked, the motor slowed down to almost a halt. I keep it cleaned and oiled. The motor is just too cheap. Im not sure what the company Wahl was thinking when they made this product. They should really consider discontinueing this model because it is hurting their image. I would not even attempt to use my warranty because it's not defected parts. It's a total LEMON. It would be nice if they will let me exchange it for a different model or full refund. I would even pay the difference. --- I do not recommend this product
Hello, ---      My name is Cloe. Yes, because I love Bratz so much I changed my name from Matisyahu to Cloe. I love this doll. IT BEATS BARBIE AND KEN BY A MILE. Speaking of Barbie I also reccommend the singer AQUA she sings " I'm a Barbie Girl." Buy Cloe and the others while you can!!! It's worth it and it will be a decision you will NEVER in your whole entire life, however long that may be, regret
I go to the movie theaters and they always have these gummy cherries. These are so good! I wouldn't dare share these! They are highly addictive and I can gobble them up in a minute
I bought the Faith Hill DVD to hear her sing but instead the songs were interrupted with talking.  I would rather have had the talking put to one side and be able to place the music uninterrrupted. Wish I could get my money back!!! So spend your money on another DVD
My daughter has trouble concentrating in school. I got this for her birthday and her grades instantly improved to the point where her teacher stated that there was a noticable improvement in all areas of her work. The best thing about it is that I don't have to tell her to use it because she loves it. I told her it's just like having a laptop because she always wanted a computer of her own. This is as close as I'm willing to get concenrning her having her own computer at her age, plus it's a minute fraction of the price of a personal laptop. ---  --- For children who don't have a hard time in school, this may not be for them but for my daughter it is a whole lot of what I needed to help me help her learn. I just wish I could find an adapter. 
The software is better than the previous Family Tree Deluxe version I bought.  It allows you to better classify potential matches and decide whether to look at them later or tag them if not interested. The merging process of two databases is easier and allows you to pick what info to merge or whether to keep some info as secondary
This is the standard style from the new line of Performance jocks from Bike. This waistband is slightly smaller than the traditional 3 inch, but very comfortable. The pouch fits nice and snug giving you perfect support and the leg straps don't twist or bind. Easy to launder and pretty inexpensive. I got rid of my old worn-out jocks and bought a few of these new ones. They're masculine, modern and comfortable, but not something that would be embarassing putting on or taking off at the gym (like an orange or blue jock). A good buy.  Comes in a black version, that is also great.  I've worn for working out, and just around town - good for both.
I received this subscription as a trial, and found it one of the most boring publications that I have ever read.  By the last few issues that I got, I wasn't even looking at the pictures anymore.  There are drawn-out descriptions of their views of the finer things in life, which were very materialistic.  At the end of every issue there were pictures of "real-life" wedding announcements.  Perhaps this is fitting for your local newspaper, but it struck me as out of place in a magazine
After hearing all the great reviews about this product I was very dissappointed when I first plugged in these phones. The bass was very flat and the phones were not very clear.  The other reviewers mentioned a break in period so I decided to leave the phones running on my CD jutebox for about 30 hours. WOW!, what a difference in sound.  It was like night and day with the sound quality.   The sound is truely amazing.  The bass was very good and the phones were very clear.  Grado needs to state this breakin period on the box or manual because some people may decide to return the phones not realizing there is a breakin period
I was surprised to find out that amazon sold groceries and at a much better price then could be found in a supermarket. A+ to Amazon
I use this gem on my 20D along with my 24-105mm, and as far as I'm concerned it is one of the best optical lenses out there. My 24-105 isn't the ideal indoor/low light lens nor is it the ideal sports photography lens( although it is sharp, just not quite long enough) The 70-200 fills in that gap in my arsenal with IS to boot! The photos I've taken so far on the sidelines are all keepers. If you can afford it, do it, you won't regret i
this was a christmas present and it continues to fall apart. the archways do not stay on them. too expensive for what you really get. i ended up putting most of it away except for the center cake piece and the cats. I would not buy it
just as advertised, very small, very useful, great video, great photos, just what I needed ---  --- this is the second JVC camera I own and both satisfy my needs
I have received so many compliments on this fragrance. I can always pick out the scent when someone else is wearing it. Although a fragrance will smell different on each person, I have not known of anyone this one did not work for. I guess the negative reviewer is the first I have heard of. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes a fresh fragrance
I got this phone in January, and I had to take it back the day I got it because it kept losing service and dropping calls.  They gave me a new one thinking that it was just that phone... but it wasn't.  The one I have now isn't as bad as the first one, but it still loses service and drops calls constantly.  Don't buy this phone
The scales/handles seem decidedly gray, rather than black.  Pen has nice length.  Battery hidden under plastic liner.  Even found a nice thin layer of oil of some tools!  :~))     At the outer limit re carrying in front pants pocket .... unless work jeans
I have always dated men who wear this cologne. Not on purpose but I always seem to find or smell men who wear this scent. My mother calls it sex in a bottle. The scent is light and pleasant but still smells like a man should smell
I think that they are great diapers. I have used other diapers in the past and I am now sitcking with Luvs!!!! I get more for my money and they work great.
This is a good 1st season set for the series of Criminal Intent.  I strongly recommend this if you are a fan
 I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE LIGHT OUTPUT.  I PURCHASED THEM TO LIGHT THE INSIDE OF MY CHILDS PLAYHOUSE.  THEY REALLY ILUMINATE THE INSIDE AS BRIGHT AS A STANDARD LIGHT BULB.  I PURCHASED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AN EARLIER TYPE LANTURN BY RAYOVAC AND WAS REALLY PLEASED WITH IT ALSO.
Only works properly if you are not moving AND in a zero-gravity environment
I love green tea pocky. it's flavour is indescribable! it's sweet, yet light. you can only eat a few though, before it's enough for ya.  ---  --- I'd suggest that everyone try these, they're that good. :D  ---  --- also, the strawberry pocky with little chunks on them are awesome too. ^_^ try them
Used this for a trip from NW of Chicago to Houghton, MI (in the U.P.) and it worked fairly well except through some hilly sections (lost signal a few times). This works best when you have two people (driver and navigator) as looking over at a laptop while driving isn't a good thing! Would have been even better with voice prompts but at the price I wouldn't expect it
I am the kind of person that gets leg cramps or easily gets tired legs after a short walk, yet I need to work and that means that I have to be standing long hours. So when I tried your leg massagers I was ecstatic to find out the relief it gave me after a 10 minute use. I now use it every chance I get, my children use it after their soccer games and love it as well. It is one of the best purchases I have made.  It was worth the investment
I purchased this camera case for my granddaughter for Christmas to go with the camera her parents had bought for her.  This is the first time I have ever been DISAPPOINTED with a product I purchased from Amazon.  It was, in my opinion, not worth the price I paid!  The picture looked much larger that it actually was.  I wil continue to purchase through Amazon but I will be much more careful and definitely return it if I'm not satisfied.  In this case I did not have time to find another camera case.  --- Thanks for giving me the opportunity of expressing my opinion. --- Linda Sutto
If you like strawberries you'll love Crunchies!  Only 98 calories per pouch - I snacked on one pouch all day and didn't finish it off!  Very convenient- resealable.  I have other varieties on order! 
Great concept: protective rubber skin that protects the BlackBerry unit from accidental drops and scratches.  The rubbery material tends to collect all sorts of dust and lint.  It's very hard to get it off (unless you wash it with water or use tape to peel it off).  The protective cover doesn't fit around the screen too well.  Mine tends to be stretched out a little more on the left side than on the right (even if I try and reposition the unit itself).  The plastic screen cover (that can be removed) was already scratched due to the way it is packaged.  All in all, I am pretty disappointed... mainly because I paid over $33 for it.  It's now sitting on my desk at work collecting dust
I love the feel and multiple spaces available the only problem/fear is that I have had things fall out of it when snapped and string tight.  I would give it a 5 star if there was a zipper option to keep items secured
it is the best product of it type on the market and i wish it were more available in stores.i don't know what you mean by give your review a titl
I have been using Frederic Fekkai's glossing cream for a few years now and love it so I thought I would try the luscious curls.  It was very thick, which may be a good thing since there is so little of it, but doesn't spread through hair very well.  It left my hair a little crunchy, and the crunchiness didn't go away for a few hours.  When it did dry, i felt that my curls just kind of hung there, without much body or shine.  I have used Loreal's Professional line prior to this and I will definitely go back to it.  It's cheaper, better quality, and twice the size of luscious curls.
For all of the supposed 'resistance' built into this machine, it enables you to do  many -more- repetitions than you'd be able to do  of simple bodyweight 'core' exercises,(crunches, leg lifts, situps, and a multitude of others). Why is that, and what is the effect? 1/ Why : The resistance is -less- than the resistance supplied by the weight of your own body being moved around without any equipment. The so-called 'resistance' actually -assists- you on the return motion, the exact opposite of exercise.2/The Effect: You must do an incredibly high number of repetitions do get any effect at all, and it won't be much even then. High rep work should be full-body cardio , not isolated ab work. Ab work should be the same as any other muscle-building work : After you can do 15 reps , the resistance should be raised: Exercising the abs, obliques, other core muscles  to strengthen and build them. If an exercise doesn't get difficult enough to make you stop after a minute or so, it simply isn't difficult enough to do you any good. There is no such thing as spot reducing exercise. Modern ads know better than to claim the lie of spot-reduction, but they still strongly imply it. Why do they get away with it? : Because people never stop looking for an easy way out. The re-sale value of these gizmos goes down to around 5 bucks as soon as you own it. Why? : Because the market is flooded with as-seen-on-tv, home-exercise junk that's collecting dust
For those of you who like the addition of briny olives and capers to your sauce, here is the answer.  What a great balance of flavors, and a quick and easy, yet delicious dinner alternative
This is one of the worst-written programming books I have seen yet.  I'm sorry I bought it.  It appears to be written by a man who knows quite a bit about finance, and dangerously little about C++ programming.  Duffy's review correctly describes the main flaws.   ---  --- I would add that (1) The book is not structured to build upon OO, GOF Patterns, or STL design principles; (2) The code does not follow even basic C++ coding conventions; (3) The images (screenshots) are agonizingly UNREADABLE; (4) The code listings are in ITALICS using a variable-pitch font [is COURIER font code listing so difficult to include in a $100 book???]; (5) No over-arching component object model is suggested ANYWHERE in the book. ---  --- Some of the efforts at brevity are just plain WRONG or even DANGEROUSLY WRONG to teach beginning programmers.  For example, Pg 19 Data Types section: ---  --- ---------------- --- int - holds integer numbers up to a little over 2 million, for example, "int I = 2000000;." --- long - same as int. --- ---------------- ---  --- WRONG, PROFESSOR!  This is not only a syntactically incorrect example, but a just plain wrong assertion.  If the reader does not know how to determine the (platform-specific) size of an "int" or "long", then the author has only served to confuse the matter further! ---  --- Furthermore, I consider it a "cheapskate" tactic to ask readers to pay for the code from this book in electronic form (particularly when the book's code listings are so sloppy).  That said, I would not use the code, even if it had been supplied for free ... but it *might* have been interesting to have something to play around with... ---  --- Have any of the reviewers actually USED any code from this book without substantial refactoring? ---  --- The only use I could see for this book is for intermediate-advanced fin-techs, who want to review a few general algorithms for selected derivative calculations (futures, forwards, etc) ... but just be prepared to squint and suffer through reading the code
One of the pairs of magnets that is supposed to keep the flap closed are oriented in such a way that the same polarity face each other. Genius! Not. The result - the flap would not close and leave a gap that just keep on repelling each other. grrr...   ---  --- One more thing, only the screen is protected by a clear plastic. The wheel is not
The elastic in these shoes makes them too uncomfortable to wear. Otherwise, the quality of the lace shoes is good. I'd wear them if the elastic didn't dig into my foot (I have small feet too!)
FUNCTION FOLLOWED FORM On this one!! You can't see anything in the outer window, especially in the sun light. So you can't see who's calling or what time it is without opening the phone. It hurts your ear when talking. The buttons are difficult to push. It's my third Motorola and the prompts are different than others...Motorola should maintain consistency to keep loyal customers. Too many prompts to reply to a text. Thought the functioning of this phone was totally sacrificed for it looking 'cool'. I returned it and got my money back
Great salt scrub and it really does get warm on contact and leaves skin baby sooofft
It can be almost impossible to turn at times.  Instead of moving one to the right, you have to go three to the left, or fiddle with it so it lines up properly.  You can still solve the cube but it gets annoying when it doesn't move the way you want it to. ---  --- I was hoping it'd be better cause it's really cool that it fits in your pocket.  It's just too hard to turn.  I ended up breaking the thing trying to get it to turn one way.  And I cant put it back together cause one of the pieces is missing.  I really like this product (I'm buying another one), I just wish it wasn't so stiff. ---  --- Maybe they made it stiff so it wouldn't turn in your pocket but if you know how to do it, you can finish a rubik's cube in 5 minutes, max, so I don't see the need to prevent it from turning.  Apparently they thought people would solve like half of it and finish it latter
I agonized over whether to buy this cheaper pump or go straight to one of the high-end ($250+) models. In an effort to save money I started with this one. But I quickly realized I'd made a mistake -- it took *forever* to even get one ounce of milk. I ended up getting the Medela Pump In Style and loved it. I just wish I'd gone straight to that one and saved my money on this one. ---  --- For those of you who are trying to decide between this or a more expensive model, here are my two cents: ---  --- TRY THIS ONE IF... --- - You have a very abundant milk supply --- - You only plan to pump one or twice a month --- - You wouldn't mind giving your baby formula if you had to be away from her for an extended period ---  --- INVEST THE MONEY IN A HIGHER-END MODEL IF... --- - You're going back to work --- - Your milk supply is medium to low --- - You plan to pump more than two or three times per month --- - You are opposed to giving your baby any formula, ever (with a higher quality pump you could build up reserve breastmilk to have in case of an emergency) ---  --- Also, it's worth noting that most of the more expensive models can be safely re-used by other people so could be sold to someone else when you're done (unlike this one)
I bought this for my baby who, at 6 months was barely 16 lbs. She didn't hit the 20lb mark until she was past 18 months old, so she was rear facing for a long time. She loved kicking this but the mirror never worked well, I could adjust it and within a day or two it was all over and I couldn't see my baby again. The water seemed to evaporate and now just over a year later has hardly any water in it. We can't find any leaks but there's little water. The little fish inside stuck together right away and we could never get them back apart. Sadly we just gave up on it by her first birthday. It never worked for us as a mirror to see her and the toy part, while it was fun to kick at, was just worthless. My sister in law wanted one for my niece but I am glad she saw how worthless mine was before wasting her money on this
This remington razor is actually too sharp if you ask me.  I used it for a period of several weeks and it caused my face to blister and it actually gave me more cuts than a 10 cent disposable razor. Ouch. However, the shave is very close - expect to use a lot of cooling lotion with this razor.  The design of the shaver mechanically is fine and appears to be fairly reliable - although its a touch hard to clean because the blades are super sharp underneath the foils. I have owned Norelco and Braun for more than 15 years and on the whole found them to be a more agreeable shave
These shoes are cute but not practical at all. I generally wear high heals 4 inches and even more but these are the most painful shoes I have ever tried on. I ordered these and the peep-toe sling back version. These are really narrow in the two, my foot feels so constricted in there, they totally cut off your circulation. And forget about even trying to walk in these. Very poorly constructed. The peepttoe slings however are great, fit true to size and are comfortable.
After researching several cameras in this price range, I bought the Rebel T2 last month. It has met my expectations and perhaps then some. After recently trying out a friends camera in the 150.-ish range, I partially regret spending what I did. It all comes down to what you need, want, and how many bells and whistles you like. For the money though, compared to the competitors, I still think I made a good purchase. After all, if I use it for ten years, which I most likely will, I will have surely got my moneys worth. Bottom line: no complaints with it
I was overall very happy with the performance of this tent for the price aournd $100.  It recently survived well while being used for over a week of backpacking in Denali National Park in Alaska.  The  weight is slightly more than typical backpacking tents, but the price and features make up for that.  It survived over 40 mph sustained winds one night with no damage.  The two doors and size are decent for 6 foot people without being too cozy.  The vestibules are very handy for storing your boots.  On colder nights it did get a fair amount of condensation on the inside of the tent though.  Overall a good purchase. 
Way too sweet for beef jerky. It was similar to drinking a soda
Loved the price but I never actually received the item.  It shipped to the wrong address and I never got it back :-
These earrings are the beautiful deep blue of genuine sapphires and the 1.0 carat size is just the right size (anything larger might tend to look "fake". ---  --- I've purchased from this merchant many, MANY times and always find myself typing in *Sabrina Silver* whenever I need or want a new and inexpensive piece of jewelry...they're the best and I've never been disappointed. 
We just got this bike for my 4 1/2 year old.  It is a very sturdy bike that is easy for him to ride.  He is 45 inches tall and has about 1.5 inches clearance over the center bar.  On the box it said this bike could be used for children much shorter, but I don't see how.  It is a little bit of a struggle for him to get on the seat but once he is on he has no problems riding it.  Overall, the bike is very nice with 2 types of braking, a back pedal and hand brake.  The styling looks very nice and it arrived with no damage.  I would have given it 5 stars but the directions for putting it together were awful.  The enclosed directions were for bikes and features that this bike did not have and I was flipping back and forth trying to find relevant directions.  Putting it together is somewhat intuitive, and I did figure it out, but better directions would have been much appreciated.  
  I didn't want to invest a lot of money in an exercise bike as I plan to use it while recovering from surgery.  This one seemed to be pretty well rated and the price was very reasonable.  It does the job, but only just.  I've had it for about 2 months and the monitoring device has stopped working reliably.  Sometimes it tracks speed/distance/calories/time and sometimes it just won't come on.  At first it worked great.  Also, the seat is not very stable and is a bit wobbly.  Not in danger of falling off or anything, but just not a secure connection to the base.  Overall, the bike works about as well as you would expect one for this price to work, but I did hope for better quality
.....that's the day that the first WIFFLE BALLS (invented a year earlier) went on sale in this baseball-crazy country.  Mr. David Mullany created the first Wiffle Ball in Fairfield, Connecticut after seeing his 12-year-old son struggling to throw a curveball.  Mr. Mullany (to whom we bow down and show obeisance) cut eight oblong slots into plastic orbs that were used to package cosmetics and the Wiffle Ball, an American institution, was born. ---  --- Oh, Wiffle Ball, Wiffle Ball, it nearly compels me to wax poetic.  I'm now 46 years old, but the love that I have for the game of Wiffle Ball will possess my heart long after my body has any capability to throw a breaking pitch!  My Brother and I were born to a beautiful, baseball-loving woman.  Shirley grew up following the Cincinnati Reds, and as a child, she acquired a nickname based on a long-forgotten Big League pitcher.  As an adult, she worked for the Los Angeles dOdGers and the Los Angeles Angels (that was before they became the California Angels, and then the Anaheim Angels, and then the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, and then the Chicago White Sox victims).  She instilled in her two boys and one daughter a love for America's pastime.  (In fact, my sister was the first girl we ever heard of to play on a boys Little League team.) ---  --- But when we weren't on a baseball diamond with 7 other guys, and when we couldn't scrounge up two other guys to play a game of "Over-The-Line" at the park, my Brother, Doug, and I were battling it out in a game of Wiffle Ball in the yard.  We had some outrageously competitive games in our "Glory Days."  We perfected the art of pitching a Wiffle Ball, and baffled many a batter who tried to hit us.  I remember 1990 and a young, athletic college student who, claiming to have played Wiffle Ball throughout his childhood, challenged this old geezer on the UCLA field behind the John Wooden Center.  Well, my screwball was only breaking about 10 feet that day, and after taking it for strike three about a dozen times, he just shook his head, and I concluded that whatever game he was playing as a child, it WASN'T what my Brother and I called, "WIFFLE BALL." ---  --- If you have never owned a Wiffle Ball, you've never really been alive, my dear friend!  Although they do tend to crack between the oblong cutouts after some time (especially if you hang too many curveballs for my Brother who swings with great authority), they will last for countless hours of baseballesque bliss and excellent exercise!  They can be used anywhere outdoors because the Wiffle Ball weighs only two-thirds of an ounce, and if Doug never knocked one through a window, neither will you! ---  --- And although the Wiffle Ball is light, it does not follow that it should be taken lightly.  After San Francisco Giant (man, do I hate the Giants!), Kevin Mitchell won the 1989 National League MVP award, he publicly stated that he had really learned to hit the curveball by playing a lot of Wiffle Ball the previous off-season.  One of the greatest hitters of all-time, San Diego Padre, Tony Gwynn used to hit Wiffle Balls off of a batting tee because he could tell from the spin where he had struck the ball.  Play with a Wiffle Ball and you're in Big League company! ---  --- The Wiffle Balls offered here are the regulation 9 inch variety.  (And SURPRISE!  They're still made in the U.S.A.  The day production moves to Communist China I'll jump.)  Twelve Wiffle Balls are currently going for $14.95, that's only $1.25 per ball.  Do you have any idea how much fun you can have with a Wiffle Ball?  Well, take my word for it, you'll get more than a dollar and twenty-five cents worth! ---  --- Now all you need to do is get the regulation, Old School, plastic yellow ("banana") bat.  Of course, if you really want to splurge you can purchase the newly invented aluminum Wiffle Ball bat.  Funny story : My dear ol' Ma bought an aluminum Wiffle Ball bat as a gift for my Brother on his birthday.  But she wasn't sure what size to get, so she called the company.  "How old is your son?" the representative asked.  When she said, "41", he laughed loud and said, "I think you'll want to go with the heaviest model." ---  --- One of the great disappointments in my life (SERIOUSLY!) is that they didn't think to organize Wiffle Ball competitions until Doug and I were in our 40's.  We scouted out the competition at the "Wiffle Ball World Series" here in Phoenix a few years ago. (Players fly in from all over the country!) We figured that even at our advanced age and with my arthritis, we could still give those young studs all they bargained for and more, if we polished our long-neglected technique over the next year.  Alas, it never happened, what with work, and life, and all the other crap that gets in the way of Wiffle Ball play. ---  --- But that doesn't mean YOU can't fly into Phoenix next year and win the title!  Get to it, man!  Get yourself a dozen Wiffle Balls, a "banana" bat and start practicing.  Hint : the ball breaks in the direction of the solid half.  Want to throw a drop?  Make sure the solid section is on the bottom at your release point.  Then get inventive; there are innumerable variations on that theme!  You can thank me for the hint when you see me.  You'll recognize me because I'm always the guy who picks up the suitcase that comes around on the airport luggage carrousel with a plastic yellow bat strapped across the top of it!     
I had two unworking disks (One a PS2 game and the other a PSX game) so I picked this up and both work fine now! The only thing is you'll have to run it through a couple times. If you run it through once you'll see little difference... But for the price and since it does work... eventually, I still give it a 5 out of 5.
I thought this item came with or you had a choice of color. It did not. It is silver with black trim. It is also not very portible, you have to play it while its sitting on a flat, level surface.
This potty is completely useless.  It is so small that my three years olds' knees are up by his shoulders when he sits on it.  It is unstable on those little plastic legs and it's opening is too small for their little bottoms and it hurts them to sit on it.  This potty only stands about four inches off the ground so unless your toddler is the size of a six month old this thing is useless
(Note to Brian: The WAP54G *can* be configured as a bridge. I have two of them in just such a configuration. Took me about 10 minutes to set them up.) ---  --- Major modes of operation are: ---  --- 1. Wireless Access Point (its default set-up) --- 2. Wireless Client (connect a wired ethernet device via cable to the WAP54G and you now have a wireless ethernet device) --- 3. Wireless Repeater (extend range of wireless coverage) --- 4. Wireless Bridge (connect two ethernet networks without running a cable between them -- acts as one end of a "virtual" cable; you need two to get the job done) ---  --- A pair of wireless bridges is just what I needed but hesitated to buy the WAP54G because of Brian's comment that this wouldn't work. Because of my newness to the wireless world it took a bit of investigation to come to the conclusion that Brian was wrong. I bought a pair and they do work. ---  --- I rate it 4 instead of 5 stars for a few reasons. ---  --- 1. I understand that higher-end, more expensive, equipment can be had with more range than this box. Gotta leave some room to rate more powerful equipment! --- 2. One must dig very deeply into the users guide (a PDF on the CD) to find the default IP address in order to configure this device. Luckily I had read elsewhere what that IP address is (192.168.1.245). Other manufacturers make this info readily available, even going so far as printing it on the device itself. This will be critical info to any Linux user. Also, the users guide says that the default userid for logging in is "admin". Well, it's not. The only allowed userid is an empty field. This had me going for a few minutes. --- 3. Something that 99% of the world won't care about -- I like to have more access to the firmware. For example other Linksys products allow one to telnet to the box and do low-level analysis of the box and the network it's attached to. I think there are third-party firmware loads that enable this
This ashtray is made solid. I like quick extinguishing feature and if you open the lid all the way, the LED at the bottom lits up. I wish the LED was attached on the lid though. Overall great ashtray
How can you go wrong with these two-tone hoops?  They are stylish and substantial, and perfect for both white and yellow gold lovers.  Highly recommended, for yourself or as a gift
This is the best price I found for my second Rechargeable battery for my Nikon Coolpix 5200. It's perfect, and so nice to have a second battery!!! It was shipped so fast, I received it within a few days
This Elmo table will suddenly go off in the middle of the night.  I had to ship the first one back to FP on my own dime to get a new one, that one was broken as well!  The cookie monster did not work on the first one and now the ABC part does not work.  this time they are paying for my return shipping but come on!  what a pain!  shoddy electrical work.  i have the same issues with the aquarium bouncer baby seat.  make sure you get this garbage on sale! 
Use care when you use it as it can be easy to break pins, but it works just like it should and it's easier and cheaper than going to a watch store
This is a teen movie with the endless teen theme of boy seeking to get the goodies from the girl. It is better than the average for this genre due to several factors. Mostly, it is because is well done. ---  --- The subject matter lends itself to course treatment but that is not what is presented here. Instead, the situations are depicted with as much dignity as possible from hormone driven teenagers and is is presented with comedy. ---  --- The time of the film is the 50s. Society was more innocent back then but boys still had the same thing on their minds that they always have and always will. In this case, the school geek has a bad case for the school beauty queen. He is aided in his quest by the cool loner from out of town who has his own heart set on "the nice girl". Meanwhile, the unpopular girl has a bad case herself for the geek.  ---  --- The geek achieves his goal and learns that the decorative aspects of women sometimes cover up the less desirable traits. The loner finds that the nice girl really is a nice girl and that love is something special. The unpopular girl undergoes a hormone miracle and becomes a prize catch. Everyone winds up happy except the town bully/rich boy. It is simplistic in its portrayal but no less appealing for that. ---  --- Kelly Preston plays the beauty queen and she really is the stuff of dreams until the wrapper comes off. Doug McKeon plays the geek who becomes a prize himself. Catherine Mary Stewart is the nice girl that I wish had lived next door to me and Jami Gertz is the metamorphosed hormone miracle. The cast is rounded out by Chris Nash. Each does a good job in the role. Teen angst comes to the fore and a worthwhile story actually results.  ---  --- It was fun and bittersweet in the memories it conjured.
I've had this printer for four years. I print approximately 25 documents each week. This is the first time that I have had to replace the cartridge. It's a great little printer and this cartridge lasts a good long time, too. Compared to ink jet printers that I have had, I get about 5 times as many prints from this laserjet -- and the price of the cartridges is about the same as the ink jets. ---  --- Great buy
This was a perfect fit for my 13" Macbook. Tried a couple cheaper ones, but was never satisfied, usually they were just a bad fit. This is by far the best, holds the computer in place and is light weight. It's true you get what you pay for. One complaint, the extra pocket in front could be larger
I bought this book and was sorely disappointed. Nothing specific. Just lots of references to self analyzation to see what you think you want to do. You could do this yourself without a book
This was the worst purchase of any type of computer hardware that I have ever made. It felt very light and flimsy, the definition of cheap plastic. Not just the construction but the performance was terrible. It would work perfectly for about a half hour and then go on a break and do NOTHING for about 10 minutes. This was very very frustrating. Maybe I was just unlucky and received a defective one, but I wouldn't take that chance again. ---  --- I wish I could give this device a worse rating, somewhere around -4 would be much more appropriate.
:: Davinci Multicolor Tortellini :: ---  --- Delicious tortellini from Italy. Great experience, like being delivered from a good italian restaurant! This product has great taste, texture, and appearance. ---  --- My only disappointment was just upon arrival, first opening the case. The boxes seemed so little. I mean, compared to the 12 oz packages of pasta I'm adjusted to buying. It says 7oz right on the web page description, very clear, but somehow that hadn't really registered in my noggin. However, things got better. I soon found out that 7 oz of tortellini cooks up pretty big, more servings than I'd have anticipated from the little boxes. ---  --- Very happy with the Davinci pastas I've tried so far. I'd be complete if only they also made some pasta sauces for AMZN to send to my doorstep along with the pasta. ---  --- Anyway, I recommend this tortellini. It's great hot...and come spring, will also give it a whirl for cold pasta salad.  ---  --- 
We all know that Tamilee has that body.  Didn't expect her to be the only body in the video.  I am more for a group atmosphere.  So in that regard, I pass on this video.  Maybe next time Tami...
I use these onions for just about everything.  They are pretty mild and really add a nice, light flavor to your cooking.  This is about what I pay for three pounds so keep that in mind too when you order.  But, then again, it is online shopping for groceries so I guess it has to be pricey.  I use these on a daily basis and never seem to have onion breath!  Great, great stuff and I highly recommend them
Like the Backstreet Boys (essentially the same band), and Brittany Spears (their female solo artist - and I use the term loosely- equivalent), NSYNC represented all that went wrong with the music world in the '90's. Sure, there have been completely commercial bands out there for ages, but at least groups like The Eagles wrote their own material and played their own instruments. Not NSYNC, who instead rely on unimaginably boring backing tracks and a stable of professional songwriters who couldn't write a decent tune to save their lives - I bet even their voices were digitally altered.  --- And then there were the inescapable hits - Bye Bye Bye, Pop, It's Gonna Be Me, Tearin' Up My Heart, et al., that weren't even good the FIRST time around, to say nothing of the nine trillionth. No risks taken. No attempts to step out of their winning formula that somehow made this group of no-talents famous. Basically, this band was thrown together by a bunch of record company chumps who saw five or six guys who wanted to be famous (and probably had never previously met), sent them through the assembly line, removed any sense of individuallity or creativity they might've had, and dumped them upon the masses, who they must've brainwashed or something. I didn't even like this group when I was 10, to say nothing of now. Makes you wish Zappa was still alive - he'd have a field day with a group like this, and undoubtedly dish out some of the funniest insults ever in the process.
I was having problems with my second i730 transmitting and receiving, so I decided to upgrade my phones.  (the first 730's speaker grill came off, and i tried to glue it back on myself.  A word to the wise, don't use too much glue.)  So, I went to Nextel to get my new i760 after researching it on the internet.  I didn't need a camera phone, since I have a digital camera that takes awesome pictures.  One bad thing is that since I changed my phone back in April, I couldn't sign back up for two years and get the $150.  I could only sign up for a year, and I had to pay $275.  I don't understand that.   --- But this review is about the phone: --- Cons:  --- super short battery life, especially if you have the web. --- instead of having a separate button for each number key, it has three big keys, with little squares to make it look like there are separate keys. unfortunately, you have to be careful and hit the button fairly close to center, otherwise you'll dial the number above or beneath it.   --- the jury is still out on this one, but i'll list it under cons.  the casing looks like it might break easy since it is mainly plastic, whereas the 730 at least looked like some sort of metal. ---  --- pros: --- huge display --- a whole lot lighter than the 730 --- i enjoy the photo caller id.  it also shows the photo when you call that person --- the sleep mode is a good addition.  if you don't use the phone for a couple of minutes, the phone will power down a little like your screen saver so all you have to do is push a button to wake it up. ---  --- The only thing I really miss from the 730 is the multitude of the lights around the motorola emblem on the front, especially since there were several colors.  This phone just blinks a lot to your ring tone in a light blue.  OH well.  I'll write more the more i explore the phone. 
I think simply put, if you like Bob Dylan and just want to have fun with a movie, then you'll love it. The performances Bob gives are excellent, and it's great to see the ensemble of actors they lined up all together. ---  --- If your not much of a Dylan fan, and like your movies high and mighty, better just pass it up..
This is an HBO remake of the original 50's 50 footer. Naturally there had to be some adjustments for the new era. However it still captures the thrills and chills. You may also marvel at the spandex clothing that stretches for ever (rats.) ---  --- Nancy (the little woman) does not have quite the devoted husband. Here life is not quite ideal. Soon a chance encounter with aliens (the space type) leaves her feeling bigger about the situation. 50 foot bigger. Now it is Nancy's turn for a little revenge. The ending is a little unnerving. ---  --- Be sure to see Daryl in just as serious of a role in "High spirits" (1998) --- 
I just received this phone free as part of Verizon Wireless's "New Every Two" program.  My main gripe with the phone is that, unlike my former phone (Motorola V265), it cannot be set to display the time in the 24-hour format (I do not use am/pm).  Otherwise, the screen is nice and bright, it's easy to use, it's much less bulky than my former phone, and the voice activation is easier
I received "The Piano" promptly, and in pristine, excellent condition.
I've been a faithful subscriber to "America's Civil War" since 1993, and I'd say that it's easily one of the best history-related magazines in existence. I read each issue cover-to-cover, even the letters to the editor. Long after I first started studying the Civil War almost 15 years ago, I'm still learning a lot from this and other magazines like "Civil War Times Illustrated" (which is also great). In each issue of "America's Civil War" you can find a variety of articles in the following categories: personality (which focuses on a specific soldier of officer), eyewitness to war (great first-hand accounts from both soldiers and civilians), men and materiel (weapons and equipment), reviews, commands (focuses on individual units), preservation (of artifacts and historic sites), and of course several articles which can cover a wide range of topics, from battles and leaders to politics and slavery. Although I wish more would be written about the neglected Western Theater, I feel that the articles cover most aspects of the war very well. I love the artwork and outstanding maps that accompany the articles. And, "America's Civil War" is all about pleasing the readers. Back in 1997 I mailed in a questionnaire from "America's Civil War" after writing that my favorite issue had a great article on the famous Irish Brigade. A few months later a new article on the Irish Brigade (by the very same author) appeared in their magazine and I was very impressed by this. Bottom line: if you are a Civil War buff this magazine is just what you need
I have owned several pairs of this very boot since 1990; and the first two pairs lasted many years through winter, spring and fall. Each boot used top quality leather and Vibram soles. I actually had the soles replaced on the second pair as they became worn out before the leather upper portion of the boot. Both pairs were very comfortable and durable, with a look all to their own. ---  --- My third pair, which was recently purchased, were not of the same quality of the prior pairs of boots. The leather was stiff and upon wearing them the first time the top lacing hook pulled out as I began to snug up the laces. The backer on the riveted lacing hook was defective from the factory.  ---  --- Not being satisfied with the quality of the new boots, I sent them back. I did notice the country of manufacture was different on the later pair than the previous pairs. Made in Portugal to made in China... the quality has been degridated and am disappointed in Rockport.
For the price I paid I expected much more accuracy.  The data it downloads from its external monitor to the PC is terrible.   Even though the unit is synchronized with the atomic clock it still seems to get the dates wrong on the data it stores in its database.  It also has a problem with the accumulated rainfall.  The amount of rainfall according to the database is much higher that what the display shows for the accumulated amount.  The hourly and 24 hour period also tend to behave eratically. You might see an inch of rain in the last hour but when you come back later, the last 24 hours shows only .2 inches of rain.  Strange.  How can you have more rain in the last hour than in the last 24?  Seems backwards. ---  --- On the good side, the unit is easy to set up and connects to your PC with existing ports and a cable that is provided.  On the bad side, besides being inaccurate, the analysis software is primitive and difficult to work with.  You are better off downloading a text file and doing analysis in Excel.    ---  --- This unit also gives eratic readings with the temperature swinging up and down up to six degrees within a twenty minute window.  I wanted my son to see how the temps over a 24 hour period form a bell shaped curve.  So much for that.  This is probably OK for a first time weather station for my 8 year old but I would not recommend it for any one else since this unit is not cheap.   ---  --- One other thing, it only takes a reading every 1-3 minutes so wind speed readings are hit and miss.  You could be getting gusts much higher than what this unit happens to read.  I am dissapointed and annoyed that I spent the money and it is not at least semi-accurate.  I will tell you that I have it set up wireless.  If you use the enclosed hard wire connection option then you will get more frequent readings and maybe even better accuracy.  Good luck and do your homework first. 
This is the most deliciuos chocolate! It can be a bit messy, but it's well worth it! If you love chocolate, you'll love Flakes
My 4 year old son loves all things Rescue Hero!  His grandparents got the MACC for him almost a year ago now.  I run an in home day care,so I watch not only my son but 2 other 5 year old boys and my youngest son, 13 mo and a 10 mo old boy!  They all love it!  This thing has stood up to all of their adventures! One of the kids I watch was thrilled when he got the same MACC for his birthday from his parents!  He had just went on and on about it, and they couldn't resist.  It is very large, but we already had the firetruck, police car, helecoptor and about 30 rescue heroes, so,in the words of my son, we just HAD to get this too!  I highly recommend this toy for all ages!  Great imaginary play
Do not buy anything from this company unless you will be able to return it within 20-30 days of the shipping date.  (The receipt says 20 days but the web site says 30 days.) You don't have much time to return an item, and the company does not give any leeway for Christmas orders.  I am stuck with the item my son did not want for his dorm room, and I can't exchange it for another item because he didn't like any of their products. 
Dr Smith and the Robot go hog wild, switching personalities and swapping insults.  This is a great episode
My daughter ordered this to go with The Crib Shield System. It's a nice addition to the System and looks very nice
Outstanding comparitive review of new vehicles for 2006. Combined with Consumers report evaluations, no reason to go into dealership with many questions. December 2005 issue a "must have for serious lookers" contemplating purchase
OK, I know I'm going to get hammered for this; once again, there goes my reviewer rating. But I just HAVE to be honest: this is a terrible story. OK, being that it's Shakespeare, it's prettily told, but it's still a HORRIBLE story, and I can't imagine why otherwise sensible people like it. Perhaps they feel that Shakespeare is telling it tongue-in-cheek (it IS a comedy, after all) and poking fun at the system of fathers marrying off their daughters without any concern for whether they want it or not; that would almost make it tolerable, if I could believe it. But given that it IS a Shakespearean comedy, we must assume that the ending is supposed to be a "happy" one, and the situation at the end is far from pleasant. Or perhaps people believe (I've heard this claimed in all seriousness) that Kate has actually "triumphed" at the end, having figured out how to manipulate Petruchio so as to get her way subtly and underhandedly. Even if this were true, I'd hardly consider it a "happy" anding, and personally, I see little evidence of it. ---  --- No, what we actually have here is a story of a strong woman (some people seem to like it simply because there IS a strong woman to be found in it) being married against her will to a scheming golddigger who "Tames" her by blatent if indirect spousal abuse (he doesn't beat her, simply starves her and sleep-deprives her, as well as forcing her to wear muddy rags until she behaves exactly as he wants, up to and including winning him a bet by lecturing her contemporaries on their duties as obedient wives. Her spirit may or may not be broken, depending on how the part is played, but the fact remains that she's forced to BEHAVE as if it is, and that's not a message that should be bruited about in a "comedy". This is absolutely the WORST of Shakespeare's plays
The aspirator has no suction power and only irritated my son.  The nail clippers are not sharp enough to cut a newborns soft nails.  I use my own Revlon clipper especially since I am comfortable with the feel of it already.  The thermometer is sooo... slow, I get make an educated guess faster.  The case is cute and I am sure the medicine droppers are ok...haven't needed those yet.  But all in all, I threw half of this kit in the garbage
I did buy this grill in a store and now that I search Amazon for acessories I find that it is a lot cheaper here. It is a good grill the way it works but the quality is lacking. Many parts are not as sturdy, corrosion resistant or easy enough to clean as I would expect.
Fits great My Wife likes the bright color as it is easier for her to find in her purse and protects her phone
I liked SSX series, sequel 3 being the best, but I didn't play racers . I bought first NFSU and disliked choppy animation. I got part two just out of curiosity and I liked it so much I beat the game. ---  --- Basically , you are newbie in Bayview City and you race different type of races and build rep and your car. You must tune your car for each type of race and you must check shops frequently . There are various shops, from visual effect and paint shops to ones which improve your car speed, handling etc.  ---  --- Races are also different: you have races on isolated tracks, races in live trafic, Street X races in confined and cramped space without nitro option, with lot dirty driving and hitting; short tracks in which you win if you shift the gear in time, and my favorites, drift races, in which you win if you get most points, not if you pass the line first. Drift races are won by breaking and steering in order to make long trail.  ---  --- I used automatic shifting and I set game difficulty to easy since I don't play racers. I was about 93 percent and I got into race which was unmarked on map. It was 6 circuit race against boss and that was final one. ---  --- SOME ADVICE FOR BEGINNGERS: --- If you can't find races on map, go to garage and check out world map option and you'll get list of all races per level. If you beat them and can't find any more races, upgrade your car or get some stars on visual rating by getting 'cosmetics' (new parts like spoilers, lights, new paint) and you'll get an offer for magazine cover or DVD. If you are still stuck, cruise the town to find unmarked races
what i mean here is about 3 and a half stars which in my little scheme of things means the good pretty clearly outweighs the bad and i recommend it with a bit of enthusiasm. 4 star games are very rare for me and this game made a good run at it. i can't even imagine a 5 star game. i've come to think there are too many inherent problems in games for 5 stars. ---  --- anyway, ahem, this is about gun. a very nice game i looked forward to a lot. i played it just after it came out and hopefully havent forgotten too much about it. ---  --- the positives: ---  --- graphics! this seems to be a bit controversial as some people complain about them, but frankly i sometimes think people overrate realism and detail. gun's detail was not like, i dont know, half life 2 or something. i didn't repeatedly go "wow, unbelievable todays technology!" but i really enjoyed them. they were pretty to look at, they set the scene well and they were extremely refreshing- bright, colorful, open western vistas instead of dark, gloomy, tense, industrial, claustrophobic and filled with horror creatures and commandos like, i don't know, 95% of all shooters. it was lovely to ride my horse around spotting buffalo and hot springs and such. i appreciated that quite a bit. ---  --- difficulty: well, i can't remember if this game had difficulty levels. but i like difficulty levels and make a bee line for the easy choice! i do not like dying! even if i can reload right away, and i am not too great at these games. well, so, up until the last part of the game (more about that later) i had no real problems and generally felt clever and talented but not coddled and unchallenged. the poker was too easy though and i could not get the hunting and gave up on it part way through (i thoroughly completed everything else). ---  --- characters/voice acting: pretty good characters helped by superb voice acting. i don't want any spoilers here so i'll just say the quality of the characters was let down by the storyline, but i still liked them. and they looked pretty good to me. ---  --- gameplay: it was quite fun and varied. it had some of the best bullet time ever (called quickdraw or something). i loved how you could flick target to target with a single button which not only made me feel more impressive but also raised the speed of mowing down enemies in a way that made it less ridiculous that i was beating 11 people in a gunfight. the horse riding was done very well and it was nice to pony express. i liked that poker was in it though found it a bit limited, and both the ranching and mining were really nice and helped fill out the world and the variety of things you do. ---  --- length: i may be an exception, but the vast majority of games go too long for me. the feel of them and the things i do in them become redundant and i don't finish, so i like that gun seemed manageable. for the most part i was pleasantly full when i finished though perhaps finishing things was a little too cut and dried, like the way you can get every upgrade possible. ---  --- the negative: ---  --- story: it should have gone a bit lighter, i mean, it seemed to think it was some powerful clint eastwood directed western but unfortunatly computer games are not capable of pulling off anything nearly that sophisticated. they just have too much on their plate vis a vis gameplay and choice. the cutscenes and acting were nice, and it started solidly, but storywise it progressively deteriorated, or i guess was completely unable to fufill its set up. it gets a little hard to discuss without spoilers but, well, more romance would have been nice and the boss battle that goes on and on was not just difficult for me (remember how i hate that!), but it was irritatingly stupid, and senseless to the reality of the game. ---  --- conclusion: wow, only one big negative, but the huge, long, ending boss battle really bugged me. really, good game though. oh, and by the way, i have a pretty midlevel computer (and fading fast) and didn't have any real technical problems, maybe a couple of ugly frame slowdowns, but mostly it was smooth. that's just, you know, for what that's worth.  ---  --- anyway, if some of what i am talking about makes sense to you go try this game out
We registered for two of these mobiles for our twins.  We recieved both of them.  Upon putting them together, we realized that the mobile can't operate without the pieces hitting the bar that holds it to the crib!  How annoying!  We returned them both
The armoire is very pretty but please show pictures of the inside of the furniture pieces because I was expecting something else. I still like it very much but I wanted a part to hang clothes and it doesn't have one. It is very pretty and from the outside it was everything I was expecting!!! ---  --- Thank you
Purchased this phone as an upgrade from the i530, which I loved. I was at the end of a 2 year contract, and felt that I would get something with a few more bells and whistles - and was excited about the color screen with the icons.  Two of my family members have higher end Nextels and all work well. I would have purchased one of those, except I didn't really care about a camera for my phone, and this one was reasonably priced...and I found out you get what you pay for!  The i560 felt almost cheap in construction compared to the i750, i870 and even my old i530.  I had it for a couple of weeks when I started having trouble with the clarity of my calls - I could hear them, but they couldn't hear me.   ---  --- A couple of times, I had the screen go to Airplane Mode, even when I hadn't touched it.  The fact that you had to take the whole phone out to see who is calling was another downside, too.  My previous phone had to be flipped open to see who was calling, but I had a holster that could hold the phone without disengaging it.  Not a great design for this holster. Another problem is with the power supply. When charging the phone, it is especially important to make sure the plug is seated tight - and to check that is says device attached - it comes out easy and stops charging even when it appears to be plugged into the phone correctly.  ---  --- Then I am on a phone call on speakerphone and the whole speaker just stops working.  Living in California apparently gives us an advantage - 30 day risk free guarantee.  Fortunately, we were on day 12, and after 54 minutes, one accidental disconnection by Nextel and 6 customer service agents, I finally received a return authorization and placed a new order.   ---  --- Terrible, terrible phone.  Stay away from it.  Hoping the new one on it's way works much better! ---  --- Michell
When this jumpdrive was plugged into my Windows 2000 system, the software that it loads corrupted the boot sector of my hard drive. The Lexar "technical support" was no help at all. They told me to reinstall my system. ---  --- Luckily the computer repair person I hired was able to recover my data files before the OS was reinstalled. Lexar would not cover one dime of my repair cost. ---  --- I will never purchase one of their product again
There is a reason there are 247 used ones of this book. ---  --- We used this book in for our men's study group and every one of the men, and every one of the wives agreed, that this was a worthless book.  It was written for a 1950's wife that no longer exists. ---  --- Now 3 truly wonderful books to help you with your wife are: ---  --- Discovering the Mind of a Woman by Ken Nair ---  --- If Only He Knew by Gary Smalley ---  --- Together Forever: How to Overcome Problems and Rekindle the Love in Your Marriage --- by Anne Kristin Carroll  ---  --- They are truly inspirational as to how to be a good husband
First I would like to state that sooner or later every computer --- user will come in contact with some problem with an Internet --- Security program. They are human made and not 100% fault proof. ---  --- I study and work in the IT field and was first introduced to --- PC-cillin through Trend Micro's product Housecall. Soon after I --- tried out the trial and have finally bought the product. I LOVE --- IT! ---  --- I have used several of the other "major" anti-virus suites --- available and have had tons of problems with them. McAfee after --- one uninstall had bedded itself so far into the computer that I --- had to completely reformat the PC to gain functionality again. --- Norton to say wasn't much better. ---  --- If you are installing on a "clean" PC where these other software --- suites have not been, I have not had a problem. I have --- installed/uninstalled PC-cillin many times each time running --- smoothly. ---  --- The software has been a valuable asset protecting my PCs by --- alerting me to virus threats and even hacking threats that were --- not even on my network but on my ISPs network. As well as --- protecting my network from one single computer that received a --- virus by shutting off traffic to that PC.  ---  --- I can understand where some of the other problems reported with --- this software may occur if the person a beginning user or just --- unfamiliar with the framework of the software. But if you already --- have some experience in how to set this type of software up I --- really do recommend you give PC-cillin a try.  ---  --- It is a sleak program, easy to install, easy to customize, and --- really goes above and beyond with alerting you to possible risks --- and threats.  ---  --- With all its competitors out there I would choose PC-cillin over --- the rest any day of the week
My six month old grandson loves these toys!  They are perfect for the teether and he loves the colors and noise.  They hold his attention for much longer than some of his other toys.  They are easy for him to hold and shake.  I would buy them again in a minute.
I bought three of these at once - and they all were fine for being an adapter to a 3.5mm headset for listening to music, but they didn't handle calls at all - everything is full of static, listening and talking. I just placed a call with it, and the person who answered immediately told me to call back that the connection was terrible, but it was the adapter that was the problem, full of static and echo. I would never use these for calls
Nice replacement for my Oprah Magazine. --- Like the concise and to the point articles.  Good suggestions sprinkled in magazine.  Very heavy with the advertisements...but then the ads rip out quickly, leaving a more simple Real Simple read.
I bought the Avent Breastshells because of my sore nipples, and a way to collect leaking milk while I was not nursing, and relieve some engorment. ---  --- 1. It is very messy when removing the colleting cap --- 2. My nipples are still sore --- 3. And the only way to relieve engorment pain is to nurse or to pump ---  --- If I would have known about these factors I would not have purchased this product
The thule 450 foot pack is quick and easy to install, fast delivery, On a scale from 1 to 10,this whole transaction is a 10+++++.
Extremely pleased!  We received the entire Strathwood Bainbridge Collection within 2 weeks and the packing job alone seems to be worth the cost of the product(s)!!  The patio furniture is both beautiful and solid. Hope it will last for many years.  
Size was true. I just did not like the
Inspiring? No! Pleasant? No! Entertaining? No! Worthwhile? No! ---  --- What are you folks sniffing out there anyway? Whatever it is, please consider passing it along, because other than the single authentic and melodic track by Patsy Cline (i.e., Back In Baby's Arms, which is available on a zillion other collections including some of her own), this CD doesn't have an ounce of redeeming musical, lyrical or social value in my view. Nada! Zip! ---  --- Even the Dylan track is junk! The entire CD is essentially drivel, put to the dull, homicide-provoking sound of endless, droning noise, with an overall signal-to-noise ratio of about one (1.0)!!! What a WASTE of an A-to-D converter
I originally bought another Motorola charger from a Verizon dealer which was twice the price of this one. I returned the other one because this one worked just as good if not better! It actually fully charges my phone in less time and I can swear my battery life lasts even longer. It's a great product for a great price! Delivery was quick too.
I recently returned from almost 3 weeks of treking around Italy. I'm not a runner (or a walker, or even mildly aerobic) and I have baby-tender feet, so I was very concerned about blistering. On the advice of some runner-friends, I bought BodyGlide and coated my feet with it EVERY DAY before I put on my socks and shoes. My feet were tired and achy every night, but NO BLISTERS!! This is an amazing testament to the power of BodyGlide because sometimes I can have blisters wearing normal shoes during a normal, low activity work-day, and I was walking for hours at a time over bricks, cobblestones, you-name-it. If you are going to be traveling where you will be walking more than usual or on a differnt terrain then you are used to, buy a big, ol stick of Bodyglide and coat your feet every day
Wasn't anything special. You can go to any beauty supply store and get a similar oil that's half the price.
This book contains the childhood memoirs of Peter Reich.  As the son of psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich, Peter led a bizarre life.  He lived with his parents on the family estate of Orgonon in the backwoods of Maine.  Not only did his father develop a unique form of psychotherapy, but he also was a theorist who experimented with unknown forms of energy.  As Wilhelm's only child, Peter was one of the first recipients of Reich's therapy methods, which involved special forms of touch, energy channeling, "softening the stomach", and inducing vomiting (in Peter's account). Peter was also made lieutenant in his father's defensive squad that protected the earth from UFO attacks through the use of "accumulator guns".  The elder Reich eventually got in trouble with the FDA for manufacturing and promoting medical equipment without proper testing for safety and effectiveness.  The court case involving his work eventually landed him in jail through contempt of court.  Not long after being sent to prison, he passed away, apparently of heart failure.  Upon his father's death, Peter found himself at the tender age of 13 forced to confront his father's legacy of brilliance and madness.  Up until the time of his father's death, he had believed everything his father told him, not knowing enough of contemporary scientific theories to understand how different his father's version of reality was from most other people's, nor having established an identity of his own through which he could objectively choose between his father's explanations and standard scientific approaches.  In this book, Peter tries to sort out for himself what is real and what is not, what is his, and what is his father's. ---  --- The book reads like the proverbial onion-chapters move in a dreamlike fashion from one period of time to another.  Sometimes it's hard to tell if what Peter is describing actually took place, or whether it was all an imaginative game in his head.  By the end of the book, the reader will have some inkling of the confusion in Peter's mind, but, like Peter, may not be capable of saying what really happened.  In any case, this is very much a book about Peter Reich, and not Wilhelm Reich, although readers who want to learn more about Wilhelm Reich may find some clues to his ideas through the interpretation of his son, who experienced them first hand and without question
I LOVED "Never Cry Wolf"!!!  I saw it years ago on video, but can only imagine the DVD is as good or better.  I was disappointed to see that it was listed with 'The Bear' to buy together....  I love Anthony Hopkins, and the Bear was one of the worst movies I have EVER seen.  Don't let the pairing with 'The Bear' scare you off.  "Never Cry Wolf" is excellent! --- Sorry Tony :-)  Okay, I just realized that 'The Edge' was the one with Anthony Hopkins... my apologies to the Bear!   Anyway, get "Never Cry Wolf"!  You won't be disappointed!!
I love The Who, a big part of my youth, probably in my DNA, but let's not kid ourselves: This is professional rock and roll made by professional rock and rollers. Is there any lyric here that Pete hasn't written before? Still writing about getting your first hit single?! And sadly the music sounds like Face Dances and All the Best Cowboys..etc, but not The Who Sell Out or Empty Glass. The band itself sounds faceless, generic. The only redeeming features are the raspy passion in Roger's voice and Pete's right hand.  --- I hope the complete album makes garbage of this review, but unless Pete has written truthfully and passionately about something or anything of what his life and the world has been like in the last twenty years I'm afraid, like Wire & Glass, it will only be a rehash of previous works, no matter how good it sounds. Here's hoping I'm wrong
I just received this watch and I have to say it's very sharp looking not to mention has some weight to it. This is not a flimsy watch by any means. It's all stainless steel and the clasp is the easiest I have ever had to negotiate of all the watches I have gone through over the years. It's very secure lock yet simple to unclasp. I would recommend this watch to anyone. Also, it's dressy and casual ~ all purpose watch
This camera case fits the camera perfectly and the extra battery is a MUST.  The price of the two items together is the same as the battery alone in local electronics stores.  So, I look at it as getting the case for free!
Apparently you need to "know" your technical specs -- Universal does not mean Nokia, so after getting the product and on the packaging reading clearly there that it doesn't work with Nokia, I get the expense of sending it back. This should be on the technical specs which are crap on this site
This item is advertised as boufant and oversized. It is anything but.... --- The shower cap is so tiny, it would fit on a grapefruit.This kind of false advertising is what discourages us from ordering on line
It has a samsung logo, but it looks fake after I bought it. The belt clipper tore of the phone holder with no reason
Decent quality, and no issues with interference at this frequency. Cannot be beat for the price
Well after all the media attention Bully has arrived. It would seem that all those nutty parental groups were wrong again. May be now they'll focus on some real problems facing our poor children. Not only did this game prove not to be a "Columbine" handbook it tries to show a better way to deal with the problems facing teens.Well the rant is over now for the rave. The game mechanics are excellent. Like many of Rockstar titles they've improved on the GTA engine allowing smoother play. Stepping away from the mission types in the GTA series Bully had to have better ideas without falling back on the GTA typical T&A/wholesale killing. Now don't get me wrong I enjoy the GTA series, and most of Rockstar's other releases.  I never passed shop class though. Seeing the GTA open ended engine applied to another series just shows me the various directions they can go in as far as game creation.The mini-games are fun and addictive. I wish they would have other classes represented. With Bully you get to not only play a great game, but some of us old folks will travel back to a simpler time. Overall this is an excellent game, worth your time, and a is a fine example of how stupid the media and those parental groups can be.
I don't know what was wrong w/ the other reviewers machine, but let me assure you, this is NOT an inferior product. I got it on Clearance @ Target for $69.98. I have been looking for a long time for a good portable DVD player. I have used it and had NO problems with it whatsoever. Plus if anything does happen in the first 90 it is fully returnable to Target. Good Deal all around. Highly reccomended.
Very nice scale, worked wonderfully for a family member of mine with poor eyesigh
I had a difficult time finding the sanding sugar.  There are no stores in my area that carry it.  I was very surprised to find it on Amazon.  The store I bought it from was quick to deliver and I was very pleased with the price of the product.  I received a generous amount and was able to "dust" all my sugar cookies! Thank you
It made my breasts look funny, it made my nipples more irritable & it left painful marks on my breasts. Hardly ever used it. :
I subscribed to this magazine for a year and found it a waste of money. Every issue has a girl in a bikini on the front (can't a woman look sexy in anything but?) And every issue claims to have "the best ever exercise for...." ok..what about the last 10 issues that claimed to have the same thing..those exercises are no longer "best ever?" I didn't like the fashion sections, and I also don't like how there really aren't any articles. When I subscribe to a magazine I'd like to be able to read it, not just look at pictures. The only thing I liked about it were the success stories..and even those seemed repetitive...are we only allowed fruit and grilled chicken?
All men can do anything, if they will seems to be the final statement of this captivating picture, carefully directed by Agnieszka Holland, one of the major female directors in the world. ---  --- This absorbing drama turns around the lives and times of three children who will meet each one another and exchange livings and fortunate encounters.  ---  --- On one hand, our little girl will know the world is not turning around her; and her initial solitude will be rewarded when she found out a hiddden that will make her dreams come true, and finally she will the one in order to impluse and bring back her cousin to the life. ---  --- A triumph of the cinema and definitively one of my top twenty best films of the Nineties.
Ordered 2lbs based upon the positive reviews. I am happy with the quality of the jerky and taste of the product, I will buy again. My kids love the stuff, not a bad snack
I am fortunate enough to have met Ms. Elaine Stone herself and find her style to be that of great elegance, sophistication, grace, and poshness.  She is by far the most fashionable person I have yet to meet.  Reading The  Dynamics of Fashion as my textbook for my FM114 class I found it very  informant and recommend it to everyone, even those who are not a student of  fashion
I purchased this game for my son and he loves it.  He plays for hours and really enjoys racing the cars.  I'm glad that we selected this game for him, he also has Underground - Hot Pursuit and he enjoys that one also
This bench was the best combination I could find that did both sit ups and hyper back exercises.  It works suprisingly well for what it costs.  The lower leg holder can be set low for back exercises, and set higher for sit ups.  The padding and covers seem decent.  Lots of adjustments.  It's not as heavy duty as the ones at gyms, but for at home I am satisfied
It took so long for this to come out...I hated the little hints they gave us hardcore NDers on the Dare to Play message board. I had extremely high hopes for this game--I adored Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon and waited AGES for this game. ---  --- Now, besides the absurd level of difficulty in this game [it was seemingly VERY hard in my eyes--I could not make it the first time through without the assistance of a walkthrough], I LOVED it. The flight to Paris and the travel about the city--it was also a LOT easier to make money in this game than in Secret of the Old Clock. ---  --- I did not like how hard the puzzles were, but all in all it was an amazing game. There was a lot of talking, and that can really slow down gameplay and frustrate a gamer. And puzzles like the darkroom, the paintbomb and the cookies were absurdly difficult. But otherwise it was worth it
Purchased this for our grandchildren.  IT DID NOT WORK! Unfortunately we had thrown away the original packaging, so I assumed that it could not be returned.  It gets zero stars from this household even if the form does require at least one star be entered.
The main appeal of the Grand Theft Auto franchise has always been the freedom it gives the player to explore vast amounts of territory and cause mayhem as he sees fit. San Andreas contains by far the most audacious expansion on the landmass available to you. This time the action takes place in California inspired locales such as Los Santos, San Fierro and the Las Vegas inspired Las Venturas, all within the enormous state of San Andreas. The main inspiration this time around is the fascination with ghetto culture that was so predominant in the early 90's. This provides a great opportunity for Rockstar to take advantage of the setting and implement some new challenges for the player to conquer. New to Grand Theft Auto is the concept of territory control, as a member of a street gang the player has the opportunity to take over every available territory in Los Santos later on in the game. Perhaps the most notable additions to the franchise are the ability to customize your character's appearance and improve his varied skills throughout the game. These may seem like rather superficial additions but they are surprisingly satisfying when implemented properly. The character's skill growth happens naturally and rarely interferes with the freeform exploration that players have come to expect from the series. The customization of your avatar varies greatly and encompasses most fashion styles found during the early `90s in California. The lower tier stores offer the usual assortment of baggy pants and sports jerseys while the more expensive stores offer suits, expensive jewelry and trendy fashions. Your characters appearance can be as varied as you want it to be and it does not stop at just clothes and tattoos, his physical fitness can also be changed. ---  --- The Grand Theft Auto franchise has improved in almost all aspects with each subsequent release and this one proves to be no different. As the last game in the series to use this outdated engine it pushes it as far as it can go in terms of graphical prowess. The graphics are slightly improved over the previous installment but they remain sub par to the standard featured in most games released around the same time. Nonetheless the visuals are quite effective as the sunsets fill San Andreas in an orange tint and the game's color palette faithfully replicates the feel of the early nineties California culture. ---  --- The soundtrack aptly replicates the time period which San Andreas draws its visual style from and perhaps the one complaint on this subject would be that Rockstar seems to try and encompass far too many genres of music. The expected genres can be found, such as Hip-Hop and Alternative Rock, both of which had a strong presence in the early nineties pop scene. However, some stations seem oddly out of place in the game world's era. Dance music and Funk each get their own stations yet it hardly seems worth it, although too much choice is never a bad thing. Making a welcomed return are the various radio station DJs, who each pepper the time between tracks with hilarious chat and amusing observations. For those that would prefer to listen to nothing but banter there are two radio stations with a talk radio format, one public station holding discussions on the day's political events and another with light talk shows. Either one of these stations is more than enough to keep the player amused for hours but just in case the PC version gives you the added bonus of playing your own MP3 tracks by adding them to the game's music library. ---  --- The sound effects themselves seem appropriate but never particularly impressive. There is the usual banter among pedestrians and the complaints from motorists as you pull them out of their vehicle and run off with their ride. All these things add a little bit of life to the game's large cities and the voice work varies enough to cover all the different geographical areas that San Andreas contains. The thick southern accents of the countryside inhabitants and the snobbish tone of the civilians in the rich neighborhoods are all present. The gunfire and explosions sound average, with not much improvement present since Vice City. ---  --- Despite the controversy that seems to follow every release in the series San Andreas is a praiseworthy title in and of itself. An engrossing action game that continues to expand its limits while continuing to deliver what fans of the series have come to expect
For the English-language reader Wedgwood's book, which has been in print for over sixty years, is still an excellent introduction and synoptic narrative of this lengthy and turbulent period of European history.  It gives brief and judicious biographical sketches of the major political and military actors of three generations:  The principal antagonists at the outset -- Ferdinand II of Austria and Frederick V, Elector Palatine;  the condottieri-style generals - Spinola, von Mansfeld, Tilly, Wallenstein, Piccolomini, Christian of Halberstadt, Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar, the duc d'Enghien (Conde); the contentious minor rulers --  Maximilian V of Bavaria, Johann Georg of Saxony; the northern monarchs -- Christian IV of Denmark and Gustavus Adophus of Sweden (and his daughter Christina and prime minister, Oxenstierna); the "spoiler", Cardinal Richelieu; the new Emperor Ferdinand III and his cousin, the warlord Cardinal-Infant Ferdinand of Spain; and many others.  This book is written in a traditional English historian's  prose style that is clear, eloquent and totally lacking the jargon of concurrent and later social and economic histories, while still covering these aspects of the period.  In spite of some reviewers' claims of a "Protestant bias" in her interpretation, the author seems extremely fair when assessing responsibility for the long-running disaster of the war, taking the position that it was the self-serving political interests of  the participants (dynasties, rulers, generals and paymasters) that kept the war going at the expense of the social and economic welfare of the vast majority of inhabitants of Germany and Bohemia. ---  ---      Although I am not familiar with this new edition (and Grafton's introduction) I emphasize that any reissuing of this book should have a brief scholarly introduction which supplies more details on the constitutional arrangements and crises of the Holy Roman Empire during the sixteenth century, with a special emphasis on the composition of the Bohemian estates and the conflicts between the estates and the Habsburg king-emperors.  The extent and internal organization of "the Bohemian crown lands" should also be outlined.  A succinct review of the political status of Lutheranism, Calvinism, the Bohemian Brethren, and other Protestant confessions throughout all of Europe around the year 1600 and  a note on how their status had altered by 1700 would also be useful in "setting the stage" for the events of 1618 and understanding the relgious-denomination consequences of the war. ---  ---      The author supplies sufficient details on the major battles, but this is not a work of military history.  As Wedgwood knows, battles were only significant in the larger view as a result of their  political consequences.  And it is in the elucidation of the underlying politics of the war (including how political prospects shifted with the waxing and waning of military fortunes) that Wedgwood excels.  In her analysis of the general European situation at the outset of the war she proposes that there were three sets of  forces which underlay and drove contemporary events.  Each was a source of conflict and each might cross-cut the others, complicating the declared interests and objectives of the dynasties and nations involved.  In brief, the forces were: (a) Religion, with three major competing factions (Catholic, Lutheran, Calvinist; she notes that the conflict between the latter two forms of Protestantism was often as extreme as it was between each of them and the Roman Catholic Church).  (b)  Nationalism (French, German, Czech, etc.), which was a new force on the scene, crystallizing the idea that political entities might be defined by nationality (which here equals some combination of ethnicity and native language) rather than conceived of as polyglot territorial agglomerations brought about by dynastic interests. (c) Monarchic-constitutional issues, which were especially complicated and ambiguous within the "constitutional" grouping of major and minor powers known as The Holy Roman Empire (HRE). ---  ---      The constitutional problem was twofold.  Within the small arenas of developing nation states and the yet smaller ones of traditional rulerships throughout Europe (duchies, counties, "free-city" areas ruled by town councils and mayors) contests over the basis and extent of the rulers' powers and privileges were taking place.  Aristocrats, oligarchs and merchants had traditional corporate bodies (estates) reluctant to cede their own powers (taxation, the organization of military service) to a central authority.  The same conflict was also being played out on the larger scale of the  Hly Roman Epire, that loose grouping of special obligations and exemptions  which was the final residue of an earlier system of vassalage binding together the elected Emperor (who had been a Habsburg for several centuries) and the smaller rulerships of Central Europe.  The religious reforms, rebellions and wars of the sixteenth century had produced a system that appeared to resolve some of the potential problems through the won privilege of cujus regio, eius religio ("whoever rules, his religion [is the religion of the ruled area]").  In the year of the war's inception, 1618, this new balance was very fragile, comprising four Catholic and three Protestant imperial Electors.   In Germany the special arrangements regulating relationships between the Emperor (resident in Vienna or Prague) and local rulers and guaranteeing a great deal of political autonomy to the locals, especially the Protestant Electors, had been somewhat codified by the Augsburg Treaty of 1555, and were known as the "German Liberties".  These would prove to be especially important to the three Protestant Electors at the outset of the war. ---  ---     In the developing continental war one could be pro- or anti-Habsburg based on any one of the above factors or any combination of two or three of them.  For example, a Catholic ruler (including the papacy) might seek Protestant allies in order to combat Habsburg territorial expansion in his direction or to combat constitutional changes in the Empire which affected his position adversely.  Or a Protestant power might accept the Habsburg "program" in any given case because it did not wish to disturb constitutional arrangements that were to its advantage (this  characterization is apt for Saxony and Brandenburg during the first twelve years of the war.)   ---  ---      As Wedgwood notes, all three considerations (religion, nationality, constitutional relations) could be and were used cynically to advance the positions and interests of individual rulers and factions.  From the point of view of rationality or predictability, political choices and commitments were often self-contradictory (e.g., a Catholic power supporting a Protestant venture; a German Liberties party accepting occupation by the army of a foreign power, etc.) or  temporary expedients that made the overall European situation more chaotic.  The war began locally in Bohemia, but its complications and consequences radiated outward as far west as Spain and England (even farther, to the Caribbean naval theater), as far north as Sweden and northeast to Poland, as far south as Italy and southeast as Transylvania; in other words, it was a European continental war with global impact. ---  ---     When the war broke out in 1618 it was over the Habsburg violation of a "constitutional guarantee" of religious freedom in Bohemia (the concessions stated in Rudolf II's Letter of Majesty).  And here is where individual personalities and beliefs played an important role.  Ferdinand II, who had knowingly violated the terms of the Letter soon after being selected by the Bohemian Diet as King (and therefore the first in precedence of the HRE Electors) was determined not only to expand the political powers of the Habsburg dynasty in Bohemia and elsewhere, he was firmly committed to the goals of the Catholic Counter-Reformation (i.e., re-Catholicizing all of the areas within the HRE which had become Protestant during the last one hundred years).  When he was deposed by a special convention of the Bohemian estates (the defenestration of his deputies in Prague being the signal event of this deposition), the crown of Bohemia was offered to the Elector of the (Rhineland) Palatinate, Frederick V, who considered himself a champion of the Protestant cause.  The religious zeal of these two antagonists led to extreme fixed positions at the very outset of the war. ---  ---     Given the other major conflict hovering in the background  -- the Spanish Habsburg determination to recover the now Protestant area of the Netherlands which had become the successful and defiant (Dutch) United Provinces - the war soon became international. While the entry of France and then Denmark followed by Sweden, into the war during the 1620's changed its nature and extended its duration, Wedgwood concentrates much of her analysis on the behavior of the two Protestant Electors, Johann Georg of Saxony and Georg Wilhelm of Brandenburg and one Catholic ruler, Maximilian of Bavaria.  It is her contention throughout the book that Johann Georg and Maximilian in particular could have prevented the war's spread and forced Ferdinand into a compromise very early in the course of events that acquired their own dynamism once they got out of hand.  Despite their religious differences these two were always strong "German Liberties" proponents, and each had the same view of the Austrian  Habsburg rulers:  they should be kept for the broader protections they offered, but kept in place with respect to encroachments on the traditional rights of local rulers.  In the end both of these rulers survived the lengthy war in spite of numerous diplomatic and military reversals (Saxony switched sides and joined the Swedes for several years, while Maximilian's position was constantly and secretly supported by  his nominal enemies, the French, as their potential foot in the Habsburg camp.)  Wedgwood believes that the price of their survival was far too costly for the rest of Germany. ---  ---      Wedgwood's gloss on the changing nature of the conflict is that by the year 1635 the war had become one of great-power politics, and that the earlier religious and ideological causes were losing their ability to motivate the antagonists.  Her summary of the changes emphasizes the following: ---  --- (a)  Religion had  discredited itself as a plausible source of political programs and a legitimate cause for war.  Religion was becoming more interiorized and private, and losing ground philosophically and ethically to the new prestige of empirical and applied science (this was the era of Galileo and Kepler, with Descartes, Harvey, Hook, Newton, Huygens, etc. on the near horizon; a time of laboratory science and scientific societies.)  As the basis of a political program religion was viewed cynically by those who saw the devastation it had brought about. ---  --- (b)  For thinking men, nationalism began to fill the emotional void in public life left by the withdrawal of religion as the underlying motive for political and cultural action.  This was very obvious in France, but even true of Ferdinand III, for whom the new main cause was the construction of an Austrian-based hereditary monarchy whose additional obligations as the Holy Roman Imperial  protector of  far-flung  German Catholics were no longer perceived as worthwhile.  In the minds of both Germans and Austrian Habsburgs the Holy Roman Empire was becoming an honorific entity with ambiguous and weak political commitments in Germany.  The Elbe-North German-Pomeranian ideal empire of Wallenstein was never again revived as a dynastic program.  Austria began to move south and east (toward Italy, Croatia, and Hungary) in its expansionist aims. ---  --- (c)  The control of immense polyglot, multi-religious, mercenary armies and their huge camp followings had become a pressing matter of concern for all of the political authorities that hired them - they were neither religious nor national in their motives and aims and were in fact independent "mobile states" unto themselves, cynical and rapacious and often as dangerous to their paymasters as to their foes; whenever their immediate prospects for pay and maintenance looked bad, they changed sides.  The most successful mercenary generals had become mini-sovereigns.  Officers were all "out for themselves" and for their troops (rather than for the cause or nation of their paymaster), since without troop loyalty they had no means of personal advancement  -- the most famous commanders, Ernst von Mansfeld, Wallenstein, Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar, the Swedish general Wrangel, all expected (and some received) grants of territory and titles of nobility as their rewards for service. The "national" armies of conscripts that came to the fore in the 18th century was the answer to this problem.  ---  ---      The pace of the war wound down during its last five years (although there were several major battles fought even then), which was a period of extended negotiatons in Münster and Osnabrück, with the "final treaty" being signed late in 1648.  For the next five years a series of conferences met at Nürnberg to implement and enforce the peace treaty and to deal with difficult problems raised by demobilizing huge armies. Many of the loans of this period, which were raised to cover the demobilization costs, were not paid off for a century.   Individual rulers such as Charles of Lorraine and the Duke of Savoy (who got nothing from the treaty) refused to vacate various fortresses for five or six years, but the war did not break out again.  France and Spain continued at war with each other, but not in Germany.  Numerous soldiers, especially officers, went into mercenary service all over Europe.   Others took to the hills as professional bandits - for the next 20 years merchants traveled through certain parts of Germany and Bohemia in armed caravans. ---  ---      Wedgwood accepts the more recent (1900-1930's) historical estimate that the population of the Imperial German lands (excluding Alsace and the Netherlands) dropped from about 21 million in 1618 to 13 million in 1648.  The number of dislocated people was also substantial.   While she acknowledges that the number of towns and villages destroyed and other "infrastructural" and economic losses were very large, she feels that all contemporary sources (e.g., the pamphlet literature of the next 100 years) exaggerated local losses, since all parties in the war continued to seek indemnities and restitution.  The free peasantry benefited briefly, since landowners were desperate for manpower to restore their estates  - prices fell while wages rose for a number of years, which increased the standard of living of peasants and artisans.  But within a decade of the peace treaty the landowning gentry was pleading with Imperial, royal and local rulers to impose legal  restrictions  which would re-create bonded, serf-like conditions for peasants. Town councils now became pawns and bureaucrats of  the dynastic courts of their rulers and also implemented restrictive legislations on peasants (e.g., prohibitions against mobility, domestic industry, and household craft production  -- a trend which later historians refer to as "neo-serfdom").   Class stratification was as rigid as it was before the war started.  There was a new, large class of mobile petty nobles and gentry seeking court-backed military and bureaucratic appointments, at the expense of town and peasant taxpayers.   ---  ---      Germany and the Austrian-based monarchy and empire were totally excluded from the international competition to establish overseas colonies and from the developing "Atlantic trade".   For a number of years the outlets of Germany's major rivers (Rhine, Elbe, Oder, and for Brandenburg-Prussia, Vistula) were controlled by  foreign powers, reducing Germany's commercial strength.  Hamburg was the exception, becoming the major maritime merchant city of the North Sea coast, at the expense of the other Hanseatic cities and the Scandinavian powers.  The only medium-sized German state to emerge with positive prospects was Brandenburg, soon to become the administratively efficient and militarily powerful Prussia.  The peace, while ending the "wars of religion",  set the stage for a long series of "nationalistic" wars that subsumed dynastic and religious sources of conflict.  France replaced the Habsburg Spanish-Austrian coalition as the menacing and tyrannical continental power willing to disturb the peace.  Austria turned to the south and east and Spain lost its great power status and became an economic and cultural backwater.  There was no politically or culturally unified Germany within the boundaries of the old Empire (French culture began to reign supreme) and the cosmopolitanism (its openness to outside influences) of this area during the 18th century, instead of being a source of pride over its achievements, became a source of lament for later cultural and ethnic purists of  revived German nationalism. ---  ---      Author's Judgment and Conclusions:    In terms of  responsibility for the overall disaster, Wedgwood points to the futility and self-destructiveness of sincere religious zeal in the cases of Ferdinand II and the Elector Palatine.  But, from the point of view of failures of practical (and ethical) politics, she highlights the behavior of Maximilian and Johann Georg, who could have prevented the spread of the conflict in 1620 and could have brought the war to an early end in 1635 if they had agreed to work together on a "unified German program" which would have forced Imperial compromises and concessions had they both stood behind it.  Between these two she sees the Saxon as the greater victim of military circumstances (pressed by the Swedish juggernaut) and therefore less culpable for the mess, while she judges the Bavarian as too subtle and too ambitious in pursuit of his own dynastic and territorial ambitions at the expense of a general settlement good for his fellow Germans, thus identifying him as the more culpable.   ---  ---      Beautiful in its style and concision, Wedgwood's final summary is also gloomy (as one might expect of a work completed in 1939, on the verge of World War II):   ---  ---      "As there was no compulsion towards a conflict which, in despite of the apparent bitterness of the parties, took so long to engage and needed so much assiduous blowing to fan the flame, so no right was vindicated by its ragged end.  The war solved no problem.  Its effects, both immediate and indirect, were either negative or disastrous.  Morally subversive, economically destructive, socially degrading, confused in its causes, devious in its course, futile in its result, it is the outstanding example in European history of meaningless conflict."
Blend a little apple cider mix into your Tazo Passion Tea and see what happens. This creates a magical apple cider experience with hints of cranberry and hibiscus flowers gathered in an ancient land.  ---  --- Snuggle Up Spiced Cider is a good choice because you can then spoon in the exact amount you desire, but packets of cider work equally well. This is the type of tea you would expect to enjoy after skiing in some distant forest where you are also munching on homemade brownies or eggnog cookies. Apple cider also works very well with the Gypsy Teas, especially the Lemon Jasmine.  ---  --- The deep purple/red color and hibiscus fragrance of Tazo Tea is enough to make anyone passionate about tea. Yet, is this really tea? It looks like tea, but it is really an herbal infusion made by steeping hibiscus flowers, orange peel, licorice, cinnamon, rose hips, lemongrass and red poppy in a swirling of hot water. ---  --- The original flavor is also slightly reminiscent of hot apple cider or hot cranberry juice which is why it is extra delicious with a cider mix. Tazo Teas are a mysterious experience into which you can lose yourself with a sense of abandon. So far I've tried more flavors than I can count and have always been impressed. ---  --- ~The Rebecca Review 
These are the best! They remind me of rice crispy treats. They're so chewy and delicious. I recommend these to anyone who loves peanut butter products
This was just a boring movie...can't understand the other --- review's saying it's good. Wouldn't reccomend it
For someone who knows nothing about Guitars and how to tune them, this tuner is a "must have"!  Came w/batteries (AAA) and clear instructions. 1)Turn on 2)pick string 3)adjust until you get the correct note.  Once I looked up the correct notes, it was simple.  It will even tell me if I'm playing the correct cord.  I tried to tune by listening to a Beginner CD and trying to replicate the sound as they suggest, but on computer speakers, it just doesn't work.  This little tuner ROCKS!
A difficult item to find in department stores.  Found some at twice the price in a leather goods store.  The Fossil leather key cases were of equal quality.  I purchased two and am very satisfied
Finally - a grill cover that actually stays on the grill and protects it in the worst weather.  The velcro straps keep it secure but it is very easy to remove when ready to use the grill.  This has to be the 4th or 5th grill cover we've tried and it will be the last one we try.  I would recommend this product to anyone investing iin a grill.  Why not spend a couple bucks more so that your $400 grill doesn't rust out in two seasons
My kids have tried I think all the gluten/wheat free ones and by far this is their favorite.  They stay hard in milk and I, an adult, even like them
Great for if you are not near a computer and need to charge your Ipo
We had purchased another hair beader where you placed a clasp at the bottom of the beds to keep the beds from falling out of your hair. The idea of this product where you could place a single bead on your hair was very intriguing.  My daughter was excited when she opened the box and  she had decorated her hair with multiple beads and it looked nice.  The problem started when we attempted to remove the beads from her hair.  The directions tell you go gently pull the springs apart and slide them from your hair.  Well, we pulled the springs apart but to get the beads out of her hair we needed to destroy the bead because the hair was tangled in the springs.  None of the beads could be reused and my daughter is afraid to use the product again because it pulled her hair when we removed the beads.  She has very long hair with a lot of wave so I guess if you had short, straight hair, this product would be fine for you
this is good for when you go on a trip you know it will keep your streetpilot going. and it isn't bulky. and it's made with quality just like the streetpilot itself
Now, I have been playing tennis for 8 years and I must say, this is my favorite racket I have used. I have been using it for about two years or so and plan on using it for many more. It seems Head Liquidmetal rackets are gaining alot of popularity and I have seen more players using them within the last year or so. For me, the strings break roughly every 3 or 5 months. However, if you play at a less competitive level. They will break twice a year maybe. If you're just starting to play tennis, I don't think this would be a good racket to begin with, however if you play for a while and find yourself enjoying the sport and wish to play long term, this is the racket you need. Enjoy
These slippers are typical of Daniel Green products, beautiful, comfortable and affordable. --- Thank
Oh, how I wanted to love Devon's book! He was such a charming rascal in "Wicked..." and such a bore in "Sinful..". There was no meat to this story. The back of the books summarizes it nicely. What would have made a better short story in an anthology was dragged on for over 300 pages. I admit I only made through about half before skimming and realizing it wasn't going to get any better. ---  --- There's no sizzling tension, the love scenes weak, and the mystery is predictable. I had such high expectations for this Boscastle book since Drake's was brilliant and Devon's character seemed such a lovable rogue. ---  --- Not a keeper for me. ---  ---  --- 
This is my favorite cereal ever. Since I started eating only organic, I picked this up one day and I love it. I eat it every morning for breakfast
GOOD: Bought watch Feb 1 2007 --- BAD: First watch showed up dead - not working. Battery?  --- GOOD: Amazon replaced next day --- BAD: Second watch showed up dead- not working. Battery? --- GOOD: Worked fine when I had the battery replaced.(+$10 out of pocket) --- BAD: First time in the shower, filled with water --- GOOD: Amazon sent another watch the next day --- BAD: was the same exact watch, I had returned first time still not working --- GOOD: Amazon agreed to refund money when they recieve the watches --- BAD: April 10th still waiting for refund ---  ---  --- I had a very similar watch from pulsar that I bought in 1991 - that watch lasted over 15 years with no problems. the LCD stopped working so I finally broke down and bought a new watch. I was shocked and disappointed with amazon sending me 3 dead watches - esp after talking to them asbout making sure it just works before sending it. the final watch was the exact same watch I returned for NOT working.
I bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it, or have already bought it--it's size.  It is amazingly small, it's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera.  I take it with me everywhere,literally, it is so small that I am able to keep it in my pocket, and I don't have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable. There is also a small covering for the lens, so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched. --- The picture quality surprised me, when I first saw this camera I saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good--but I was wrong!  The picture quality of this camera is outstanding (taking its' size and price into consideration). ---  --- However, I do have a few things to complain about... ---  --- First off, the battery.  This camera uses a lithium battery, I find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient; because what if you are on vacation, where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station--there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there.  Not only is it inconvenient, but also the battery life span is short.  The longest I've had it work was about 1 hour and 45 minutes.  This isn't uncommon in cameras, though, just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries, you should be fine. ---  --- Another problem I had with this camera was the zoom function.  Such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in...wrong!  Very wrong.  The zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet.  Even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little, resulting in a noisy start-up. ---  --- The flash is very weak.  Really dissapointing. If you are inside, you can't be any farther away then 10 feet in a lit room. ---  --- The last problem I found with this camera was the macro function.  The auto-focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject.  To make matters work, there is no manual override to overcome this problem.  The focus is great, though, if you are not taking a macro shot. ---  --- These are all the flaws I found in the camera, it's not my first choice in cameras, I have come across many other beginner cameras that I prefer over this camera, but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size.  If you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times, then this is a great camera choice. 
I am quiet satisfied with the T10.  --- 3 cons:  --- no reset button, AA battery type (I prefer litium ion) , primitive menu. ---  --- 3 Pros:  --- mp3 + voice record + fm radio --- good sound quality --- belt clip ---  --- Overall success: 80 %
I have had this camera for about a year and a half.  I got so fed up with it that I just bought a new one.  I admit, this camera takes decent pictures in good lighting when the zoom isn't used.  However, this camera takes horrible pictures if the zoom is used.  I would only recomomend this camera to someone who just wants to take pictures of of thier surroundings or to a younger person who is getting their first digital camera
The title of this product is a joke.  It should be called "Not Easy CD burning".  Roxio version 5 was much easier than this one is.  It is way too complicated for burning simple CDs
I read some other reviews that were poor, but I disagree.  My son loves this toy.  He smiles when he sees the turtle from across his room.  It plays music continually for 12 minutes. So, in the middle of the night when he wakes up, I turn it on and he's asleep by the time it runs out.  We have moved it twice and the straps seemed sturdy.  However, it is recommended that this toy be removed when the child is 5 months old or is able to get on hands and knees. This completely contradicts the interactive play mode, since the baby needs to be both physically and mentally developed to a stage beyond 5 months to reach all the buttons.
I love this product. I had a sample version of it prior to that expired, and I NEEDED to have the full edition. It came in a timely fashion as well. I am very pleased
Great little case we have two. I like the inside pocket for extra memory/battery.  
I was looking for a crispy crunchy, not too sweet, flavorful biscotti.  This prduct certainlyn fills the bill
When I saw this tub, I thought WoW this is great.  It had everything.   ---  --- Well after receiving the tub as a gift for my shower I decided to try it before the baby came.  I am so glad that I did.  The pump for the spa and shower was super loud and had a leak. The shower was very difficult to operate, I had to press really hard.   ---  --- The only thing that I loved about the tub was the sling.  It is very nice. I think when it comes to buying a tub for a baby simple is better... in the beginning speed is key, the baby gets to cold to really enjoy the features of this tub.  In my opinion get a simple tub and splurge on something else.
I love fairy tales!  I was so excited to see the author of Beauty had another retelling.  Spindles End has me very confused.  I am plugging through it and hope when I am done with it a second time I can give it more stars.  I would not recommend it for younger readers
IT IS A HORRIBLE ITEM.  IF I COULD HAVE GIVEN THIS HAIRAGAMI A NO STAR RATING, I WOULD HAVE, AND TO THINK I WASTED ALMOST $20 FOR THIS JUNK. IT SNAPS UNEXPECTEDLY ALL THE TIME, AND ALWAYS WHILE YOU ARE TWIRLING THE HAIR.  IT TOTALLY TANGLES THE HAIR. IT IS A NIGHTMARE TO GET OUT OF YOUR CHILD'S HAIR. --- MY OLDEST, 12, REALLY WANTED THIS HAIRAGAMI AND WAS TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED. --- SHE TOLD ALL HER FRIENDS NOT TO BUY IT
Since I bought the Grado Signature HP-2 headphone in 1992, the only complaint I had was that the cord was not long enough.  The same is true with today's Grado lineup and most competitors.  I could not find a quality extension cable for under $100 and even then it degraded the sound. ---  --- But this $39 15 foot exention cord from Grado really does the job big time.  I now also own a new pair of SR-60's and both headphones sound great.  I can sit anywhere in my living room and enjoy the sound.  Grado made a great product at an affordable and reasonable price.......but this describes all of Grado's products...doesn't i
I spent the extra on this alarm because I wanted a projection feature. ---  --- The projection feature lasted 2 weeks. ---  --- I also had a wall clock made by LaCrosse that does not accurately reflect either the temperature or the humidity. ---  --- Save your money, folks. ---  --- Hopefully, Amazon will refund my $$
I know that no book can cover every topic, but this book left a lot out. It went into great detail about what I should do if I got some pretty rare diseases, but barely touched on the subject of Morning sickness, which is much more common.  --- And some of the information was just plain wrong. I trashed the book when it made me freak out in the 20th week because I couldn't feel the baby move. It advised that I should call the doctor. When I did, I found out most women don't feel it move until 21 weeks. Unfortunately I found this out after I had cried my eyes out thinking something was wrong. --- I would not suggest this book to anyone
These lollipops are intense & delicious.  My kids love them, and so do my co-workers
I purchased this at my 10 year olds request for a birthday present.  I was skeptical, but since it was the only thing requested, I bought it.  We've had it 4 weeks.  What a great pool toy!  Kids love it!  We have a 22 foot above ground pool, and it works fine.  I have bought floats for upwards of $25 dollars, so for the cost of the Wave Cruiser you can't go wrong.  It seems to be well built and sturdy.  I wouldn't hesitate to get on it.  Takes 8 "D" batteries that are in a water tight case.  It will tip over as will any pool float when the rider gets rowdy, but that seems to be part of the fun for the kids.  Overall great gift idea
I bought this camera for my girlfriend and she loves it. It has all the basic functions her older Coolpix had abut more and they're a bit more user friendly.  --- Pros: Compact and easy to Hold. I've had a few other Point and Shoots and they feel like they are going to jump out of my hand. This one feels pretty good.  --- Cons: Before buying I read the reviews and a few were stating that the focus was not everything it should be. I will agree. That is the cameras only real big down fall. Though my girlfriend may not notice it so much, to me it's a little more aparant. --- For the most part, overall I really like this little guy..
This Electromate 400 saved me serveral times I will never be with out another one. Love it. I ordered this from Amazon one day and the next day it was here Very fast shipping. Well pleased Thank yo
Call me a traditionalist, but I prefer the original, jam-filled Pop Tarts with none of the overly sweet frosting on top. As a child, I liked it right out of the toaster and would take it with me on the way to school. This portable variation seems to me like a misstep from the outset. The moment I ripped open the flimsy packaging, the Go-Tart bar crumbled out of my hand and onto the floor. Apparently the manufacturers at Kellogg's decided to use the same bread-like consistency they use for their standard Pop-Tarts on this bar. Especially with the shipping aspect introduced by Amazon, I think this is a mistake since I assume the whole idea behind this iteration of the snack is the portability aspect. ---  --- On top of the bar is the same execrable, sprinkle-laden white frosting I avoided once it was introduced as an enhancement so many years ago. Without the ability of toasting the bar, I find little point to the frosting except as a purposeless sugar-rush. Consequently, I cannot agree with its description as a "ready-to-eat bar". One bar, a little over an ounce, is 140 calories, thirty of which are fat. Even though there are more fattening bars you could eat, it still has an excessive-sounding 140 mg of sodium. I only tried the "Frosted Strawberry" variation because it was part of a free promotional package I received from Amazon to promote their new non-perishable grocery line. I think I'll just stick with a granola bar if I get the kind of munchies this bar is targeted to satisfy
This bowl is extremely cute but it does not suction to the high chair.  I can get it to suction to the counter and my glass table but not on my baby's highchair, so it really doesn't serve the purpose it is suppose to
A MUST HAVE !!..Well,you can live without it,but if you don't mind spending $20-$25 bucks for a skt. holder,this is the one.Well made,versatile,and it does what its supposed to....HOLD the sockets in place.Magnets make it handy as a shirt pocket
This foundation provides a flawless finish and natural look, while also giving a good coverage.  I've been using this foundation for years, all year long, and it is one of my favorites.  Not too heavy and not too light, it's the perfect foundation.   ---  --- Being Asian American and with a light complexion, finding a good color match had always been a problem unless I spent $40 for a bottle of makeup.  Zhen is one of the best deals around - clean but stylish packaging with a superior product inside
Wow is all there is to say no problems with it perfect for a casual picture take
Well, this is the expansion for Settlers of Catan, and a lot of things have changed. The ability to build military forces adds depth to the game, as does the city improvements. The abundance of new cards is worth it if for the beautiful illustrations alone. The expansion makes the game a little bit longer to play, but it still should finish out well inside two and a half hours. My only complaint is that in several games, the Barbarians have not beaten us once, they are way too easy. However, this is minor and can be remedied with a house rule of your own. All in all, this makes a great game TOTALLY AWESOME
Great product, has more features then just CD/DVD burning, system backup, numerous audio recording, editing features, lightscribe and it's also Vista compatible. The only downside is it's learning curve some features and options are complex, but once mastered you will be more then pleased with this product. 
Thin cloth...aweful insulation factor,,,,does not look good on me..
this watch changes the background color from red to black, is great and the leather belt is soft but resisitance
These days, classic game shows aren't really as popular as reality shows like Survivor and American Idol. However, with the surprise Summer show, Game Show Marathon in CBS, many clssics had the opportunity to breathe a glimpse of new life, like Press Your Luck, Match Game, and Card Sharks. Another classic which was revised, Let's Make A Deal. With Monty Hall's benchmark into pop culture revisted, many have wondered whether the classic game of trading will ever come back onto television again. Thankfully, those who easily own DVD actually don't have to wait for the show to return. They can just trade in the comforts of their own living room. ---  --- The Let's Make A Deal DVD game, recaptures the classic trading that Monty Hall made popular from the 70's and 80's into a great fun game. In this game, Monty Hall puts traders to the test where you can trade your chances for big nostalgic prizes like classic cars from Datsun, and Cadillac, to trips and fur coats from Dicker & Dicker of Beverly Hills. On top of that, there are classic quick deals to play for extra cash. For example, if you have a pair of scissors, Monty will give you $700. Also, there are the classic booby prizes, Zonks!!! Although they are fun to receive, you get absolutely nothing to show for it. There is also the anticipation of getting the Big Deal for big bucks. Unlike DVD editions of shows like Family Feud and The Price Is Right, the game really delivers a great job from Monty, and each of the great concepts from the classic game show. The mastering really thrives with classic clips of Carol Merill and Deal's announcer Jay Stewart on each of the prizes. ---  --- Although I just wish there could've been more games to play, I am absolutely impressed with the way Let's Make A Deal was put into a DVD game. If you haven't seen this classic game show, Monty Hall hosted, you have to buy this great game. I absolutely recommend this, and that is definitely not a zonk! ---  --- Price: B 1/2- ---  --- DVD Mastering: A- ---  --- Fun & Enjoyment: B 1/2+ ---  --- Overall: B
This is a beuatiful dining set.  True, it doesn't come with the pony as it clearly states in the product description, but we have too many already.  Anyway, I would recommend it for the crystal princess castle or you can even use this with other doll houses
I bought this battery in July 2004. I charged it as soon as I got it. I put it in the camera and then used the camera about 10 days later. The battery was dead. So I charged it again and put it in the camera again. I used it and it seemed to work fine. But the next time I went to use the camera (Approximately 2 weeks to a month later.) it was dead again. As I write this review I am sitting in a hotel room in Prague. I charged the battery ten days ago. I used it once 7 days ago and took approximately 15 to 20 pictures(Did not use the flash). I then used it again today. I was able to get another 15 to 20 pictures before it went dead( Did not use the flash). I bought the lithium rechargeable battery because they have the longest life and no memory. So now I have to charge the battery everytime I use the camera. This was a big disappointment. I get better life out of the standard Duracell alkalines. It appears that this technology hasn't been perfected or that Belkin has not perfected their quality control. Beware when buying this product
I was pleasantly surprised that this product had pop-top lids. The chicken is packed in water, but not soupy. It was a pretty good buy, because I also bought another product and got a $10 discount on my $49 purchase.  ---  --- I actually bought this chicken to mix with my dogs' dry food from time to time. I was buying canned dog food, but it stank and I was finding shards of chicken bone in it. After reading about dog food ingredients on Paul Newman's "Newman's Own" website, I switched to his dry food. I have to mail order it, so I don't buy his canned food. ---  --- Despite the fact I bought it for the dogs, I did try a can of this myself. It was better than I expected. I was afraid it would have a funny taste to it from the can, but it didn't. It has an expiration date of 9 months from my purchase date. ---  --- The cats liked it, too, so I'm sure I'll be buying it again
Does anyone know whether this set will become available on SACD or DVD Audio format?  How would you contact GRP records to ask? I only give it four stars until multichannel format appears.
one of the most comfy chairs i own. just delightful to sit outside on the patio. i love my chair.  in fact i've got two. i can't say anything more then these are beautiful relaxing comfy chairs
I've been using Cross pens since I returned to my fountain pen roots several years ago but I decided to try this model because of its gorgeous design.  There are aspects of it that I like better.  The cartridges are longer, unlike the smaller Cross ones that run out much quicker and never seem to drain completely.  It was also ready to go as soon as the cartridge was inserted unlike the Cross which seem to be stubborn to get started.  It has a nice feel to it ergonomically and I nice feel to the nib on the paper. 
I just finished up my first bag of this coffee, it's great. I normally buy Starbucks Breakfast Blend, just so you know for comparisons purpose- --- but I am switching to this brand. It's just the perfect blend for me, smooth but strong enough to wake me up.
It's a pretty fun game.  It doesn't have a whole lot of songs, maybe around 30-40, but the ones that it does have are fun to sing and are songs that generally a lot of people know, or would be willing to learn.  There are also several different modes to play in, so you can play the game over and over and never get tired of it.  Perhaps one of the best features is that up to 8 people can play without any extra expansion packs or controllers; all you need is one controller and the USB headset and you just pass it around for everyone to play. ---  --- I agree with everyone else, though, when they say the headset is very flimsy.  I originally was going to get a separate headset but bought the package deal.  Bad idea.  You practically have to eat the thing to sing, and it IS small and will get caught in long hair.  Plus, you don't get the fun karaoke experience.  My advice: buy the game separately, then get the handheld mic.  As soon as I get some more money I'm gonna get the handheld mic myself, it picks your voice up better. ---  --- Overall, a good buy!  And lots of fun, especially if you have a lot of outgoing, un-self-conscious people
Normally the prices on here are competative but I agree they're off base here --- Deep Disciunt DVD is over $100.00 less for  this set and free shipping --- C'mon Amazo
Absolutely no trouble installing on 2 computers,(I use Windows XP)!! Total Protection, plus you can block many websites very easy, which is great for the computer the kids use. Came with 3 licenses
Home Business Magazine is a publication aimed at those members of the general populace who either already own a home based business or who have an active interest in the subject and would like to pursue it further. This magazine contains articles relating to all facets of home business ownership from the initial setup all the way through to the payment of taxes at year end.  ---  --- I read several different business magazines and many of them have to do with entrepreneurship. Home Business is the only one I read that is specifically devoted to starting a business in the home and, unfortunately, it has many flaws that prevent it from being the enjoyable and informative read that it otherwise could be. Probably the most annoying feature of this magazine is the articles themselves and their tendency to be written in a list- type format rather than in a user- friendly way. I realize that people like lists but Home Business takes this a little too far. It makes the magazine seem callous and unfriendly- something you would consult in the same way you would an almanac. For example, it is common to find a one page article with a title like "Effective Ways to Design a Newspaper Ad", or "How to Obtain Quick Financing". In each instance, these articles will have a short opening consisting of a paragraph or two followed by a numbered listing of different methods/suggestions to solve the problem or answer the question. This makes the magazine read more like a reference guide than a piece of reading material.  ---  --- Another thing that is annoying about this magazine is the endless advertising. Not only does it get out of hand, it also includes all sorts of ads that emphasize money- making schemes and other similar material. Advertisements with titles like "Really Lazy Guy's Incredible Little Secret Idea Can Make You Rich", "Free $9.95 Report Shows You How to Make a Fortune", and "Six Figures in Six Months" clutter the pages of this magazine with get- rich quick garbage that everyone knows is unlikely to return even the cost of the introductory package.  ---  --- Some parts of this magazine are more bearable than others and it's this handful of positive attributes that prevent me from giving this magazine a one- star rating. I like some of the success stories because they depict ordinary people who have succeeded at making a living with a home- based business. But even here, the stories are inconsistent. Some are educational in nature while others have little valuable information to share. And to make matters worse, they are far too short- usually covering only one- half page each with a large advertisement taking up the space at the bottom of each page.  ---  --- Speaking of the advertising, this magazine wrote the book on advertisement excess. Advertisements cover about 75 percent of the pages in each issue and it is rare to see even two pages in a row without some sort of advertisement. The ads are posted everywhere, often right in the middle of an article, and they distract greatly from the already limited enjoyment of the magazine.  ---  --- This magazine is assembled together in such a way that it reads like a collection of articles taken from people in different parts of the country that were shuffled around and published in one magazine. In other words, this magazine has no continuity to it. It's like taking short articles from different business newspapers around the USA and then piecing them together into one magazine.  ---  --- Starting a home- based business is a goal that many people set for themselves and there is always a need for some good, timely information when you find yourself in this situation. Home Business, unfortunately, doesn't perform its mission very well. If you dig deeply enough you can find a few good articles. But the majority is too impersonal and too shallow (not to mention smothered in advertisements) to make this magazine worth the trouble. 
I have every single (that I know of) Math Blaster game out there. My kids love them all. I saw this one and couldn't resist buying it. My 12, 10, and 7 year-olds all play this version. (It's too simple for the 12 year old, but he plays as a reward for piano practice - so I'm not too concerned about his refreshing earlier math skills.) My thought it to have each child play the grade level above theirs, and that's ususally right where they're at. Yes, there are a few annoying glitches in the way some of the characters can and cannot move around (I don't play them myself to know well) but I would hope that children are not so whiny that it matters too much. I think every family should have Math Blaster Geometry, Algebra, and all grade levels. If you can make math fun, and use it as a POSITIVE REWARD...that is called a "win win"! :
My husband is an in between size in waist and these new jeans allow that little extra umph that he needs to be able to be comfortable in his clothing.  We love them.  I gave him two pair for Christmas and he had me to order two more pair recently...seems he has decided to throw out the old ones and replace with these.  They look great too
The controller range is less than 40 feet.  This car is much too fast for the short range.  It is very easy to outrun the contoller.  There is also a delay between control input and vehicle response.  All batteries were new and fully charged, checked with a meter.  A scanner verified that nothing was causing frequency interference.  The older Tyco turbo cars had a 100 foot controller range and no delay.  Tyco apparently changed the design to the new digital control to allow multiple cars to run at the same time
Sony continues to exhibit the highest quality in their product design and manufacturing process. This case is very slim, compact, well made, and has a very luxurious feel to it. It completely enhances the look and attractiveness of the Sony camera it is designed to hold
I have straight hair, and this products makes my hair insanely smooth and beautiful...the smell is strong, but I like it, though everyone won't.  Use very little of the restorative treatment, or your hair will be very oily
I am extremely dissapointed with this new edition of the text and have one advise only: If you own 2nd ed., do not indulge in this new edition for even the errors (spellings for one) are xeroxed onto the new edition. ---  --- Therefore, for a review of the text itself, you may, without any compunction, refer to 2nd ed.'s comments, of which there are many
I didn't use mine for the first two weeks of my daughter's life because it was waaaaaaaaaaaaay too complicated! I figured it out, sort of, but to this day when I push the diaper in the film rips. Then when it comes time to change the film, the top doesn't cut the film so I have to use scissors. My sister-in-law told me to register for it. Why did I listen to her! --- Don't buy it! Dont register for it! It's not worth it! I want a refund
We subscribed to this magazine for our 7 year old.  Our 3 and 5 year olds like it as well.  We all enjoy sitting down together to read it as soon as it comes in the mail.  I enjoy flipping through it myself.  You're never to old to learn fun facts about nature!!  A perfect gift
the film is pretty lightweight on a whole but it has a nice charm with a well known Hollywood cliche in film making.I applaud the effort.the chicks in this Film are Happening Babes Fo SHO.but there ain't much to the Film but it has some fun to it
I was looking forward to get the massager, which I was for a while searching. But I regret to inform you that I could use this item for only 2 times @ 15 minutes. After the it didn't work. (the light on the adapter do not work) I'm glad that I can express this.
This book is pure fiction, nothing more. The problem is that is presented as fact - albeit little known fact. ---  --- I won't repeat the good points made by some of the other reviewers, except to say that I also concur with the criticisms of the book.  ---  --- It makes for difficult reading.  It really is not worth the effort, as you will not have any worthwhile information in the end. In fact, if you are a historian or scholar, stay away from it
I haven't worn pierced earrings in years;I thought they were sealed. When I discovered that they were indeed open, I sought some simple gold post types to wear. When I saw my March birthstone set in a simple gold setting, I couldn't resist it. The actual earring is so elegant! 'Tis exactly as described, and more! Wearing such graceful simplicity in my beauty-starved lobes makes me feel like royalty! And for such a small price with the security of Amazon! --- What a joy!  --- Sincerely, --- Miss Agnes Crosb
Almost useless! Tried it for several days of photo shoots and finally gave up in frustration. Went back to using the viewfinder without this magnifier. --- Professional medical photographer
i just recently bought this pistol and am very proud of it and i was wondering if the lighter .12G bb's will damage the gun because on shorty's  [...]  it says only use .2 can you guys help me out
I didn't like them, too sweet and sticky. My dog likes them, though. These just didn't do it for me.
I would agree with the translator that Imitation of Christ ranks very close to the Bible. I read it over and over. It is shocking clear and concise. It forces you to examine your conscience and admit that you are a sinner and encourages you not to be afraid to carry your cross and aim, yes, to be a saint. ---  --- Thomas a Kempis's words cut to the heart and ring true over and over. In the normal state of human depravity, deception, duplicity, relativism, and excuse-making no one could write such a book without a transcendant, almighty, omniscient, omnipresent and infinitely merciful Lord. ---  --- Each chapter feeds the hungry and thirsty soul and feeds the fire to seek our Lord more and more. ---  --- I wait patiently for your return Lord Jesus for your judgement and the new heavan and earth
We haven't had any problems cleaning this chair--occasionally we need to use the crevice tool on the vacuum, but that is simple enough.  Most of the time, we simple take a wet paper towel or wet wipe and run it around the seat sides.  (We'd do that with any high chair.) The tray doesn't fit in our dishwasher, but that too has been easy to clean in the sink.   ---  --- We love the neutral and plain color of the oatmeal vinyl.  Our daughter is very happy in her chair.  She is only 16 months, but very big for her age she has no problems fitting in this seat at all.   ---  --- Our only complaint is that we have to push the tray release handle in when we put the tray on in order to lock it into place or else our daughter can push the tray almost out.  that may be a defect on ours rather than a design flaw--we just live with it since it isn't that big a deal. 
I have used a lot of software, but I do not remember using much that is as difficult to use or learn than Quickbooks.  I have learned it over time, but there seem to be several functions in it that could be done in fewer steps.  I would not upgrade unless I absolutely had to.  The program is usable, but I am not interested in investing a lot more money in it.  It works for my small business, but I could still probably get by with Quicken, as I do not write checks on it.  I do kind of wish I had stayed with Quicken.  The most annoying thing about the program was that I was going credit card data downloads in Quicken, but when I changed to Quickbooks, it would not let me download data from my Quicken credit card, it wanted me to switch to a Quickbooks credit card, or ask permission of all my credit card providers.  I appreciate the security, but since both programs are made by the same company, this just seemed like a scam
My boyfriend always got ingrown hair on his neck, and he was very skeptical about using this. Now he  doesn't get any ingrown hairs and he doesn't pick at them anymore.  He will not live without it now, and we both recommend it!
It is, in my opinion, the second best Anne book! Its Anne's wedding! The whole thing is soaked in romance! Leslie's story is so amazing and sweet that you have to love her. Captain Jim is so sweet and perfect, you can nearly see him. Miss Cornelia is funny and Susan is great. Anne has to deal with tragedy and joy that makes the books so wonderful. The only thing I don't like, is that i wish Marrilla and all the Avonlea people would be in it a little more. In my opinion, this should be where the series ends
I purchased this seat because of the safety factor that Consumer Reports reported on.  In comparing the seat to Graco Snugride, however, I am very disappointed on the tough, very dense foam on the low back/sacral region of the seat.  The foam goes down to a certain point on baby's low back, and then disappears, leaving a dip for baby's buttocks.  Just imagine sitting in a recliner with support only down to the low-back region (with buttocks not supported) ...not comfortable.  I wonder how a baby's backside would stand up to a traumatic jolt in that seat...well, I'm not going to take any chances.   Baby Trend should have consulted a Physical Therapist (like me) before designing this seat.  
I tried to listen to samples of the songs and you have them all wrong. I click on one song and get another from on the list. What gives anyway
Grand old movie, well acted, will watch many times agai
I have used Synmatec products for many years and have been fairly pleased by them.  However, don't buy the upgrade or renew your subscription until AFTER your current subscription runs out because Synmatec will not give you credit for the un-used portion of your previous subscription.  I asked and they said "no way".  That aspect of "customer service" is very disappointing
Someone told me to look on Amazon to locate this product. It's great as a broth but also for gravy and jazzing up beef and poultry entrees'. The taste is OUT OF THIS WORLD and so easy to make. I inject the turkey broth into the turkey before cooking and it enhances the flavor... added bonus since the holidays are just around the corner.  Thank you for having this product on Amazon
For anybody, who wish to learn about the Orthodox Church, and Christianity in general for that matter, this book is "must-read".
I love the bag for all the reasons others did not like it.  The product is listed as a gadget bag and that is what it is good at.  The S2 IS is a large camera for a point and shoot and it fits in very few bags.  This bag fit the camera easily and had space for all types of extras including batteries, chargers and extra media cards.  There is also enough room for another small digital camera or a film point and shoot.   ---  --- The correct way to advertise this case would have been for up to two bodies or four small lens.  Given that limitation, this is a great bag. ---  --- The bag is very well made and holds my Canon Powershot S2 IS very securely.  I lay the camera on it's back and that means that even if I accidently power it on the lens opens harmlessly.  The material is great and the waist belt is very practical.  The strap is well padded and after a day of use I believe it is one of the most comfortable straps I have used.   ---  --- Buy this bag for the correct camera and you will be very happy with it.   
We bought this salt in the south of France where it is available in every supermarket. It is crunchy and delicious. It has been consistently rated as the number one gourmet salt.  Sprinkle on anything and your meal will be transformed. Yum
Even if you don't know much about Donny Hathaway, this collection of songs is a fun mix and it's very moving.  It includes some classics with Roberta Flack that are terrific.  I enjoy it tremendously
The Pixel Chix 2 Story House was suppose to intertwine with other Pixel Chix products - I had bought my granddaughter the car that you were suppose to hook up to the house so that the person could come out of the house and get into the car and vise versa - did not work - returned this item
It's October 8th, 2006.  The Detroit Tigers have just defeated the New York Yankees to advance to the American League Championship Series.   People counted the Tigers out.  Everyone thought the Yankees would walk into Comerica Ballpark and put a serious damper on the success the Tigers have produced all season long.  Nope.  Didn't happen.  The Tigers won 95 games this year.  No one thought the Tigers advancing this far was possible, but when you have excellent stars such as Magglio Ordonez, Curtis Granderson, Ivan Rodriguez, Marcus Thames, Craig Monroe and Kenny Rogers, you can't lose.  The manager Jim Leyland also played a major part in helping to reshape the Tigers as a team, and give them much-needed direction.  He was probably the main reason they won so many games.   ---  --- The Tigers are now a team EVERYONE can love- not just Detroit fans.  TV stations are now playing Tigers games again and reminding people that yes, the Tigers are still around.  The fact that the Tigers haven't been mentioned for the last 10 years shows that the fans may have forgotten all about the team, but beating the Yankees last night was solid proof the team is back, and threatening.  Proof that the Tigers can hang with the big boys.   ---  --- The celebration after the final out in game 4 was wonderful.  Everyone on the team lifted Jim Leyland on their shoulders and proudly walked around the field, while the fans celebrated and cheered indicating they still remember those successful championship years a long time ago, and obviously still support their home team.  It got extremely crazy when the team decided to spray champagne at the audience, and they enjoyed it!  Even a cop wanted to be sprayed.  The celebration supposedly lasted an hour.   ---  --- This Vintage Crest T-Shirt should PROUDLY be worn by you.  I want you to take a trip to New York City wearing this shirt and walk down the street so everyone can see how much of a proud, loyal Detroit Tigers fan you are.  The days of watching them lose game after game are finally over.  Long live the Tigers.  Make sure you buy this shirt to celebrate the wonderful run the Tigers had in the season of 2006.  You need to wear Orange if you live in the Detroit area. 
Absolutely no power whatsoever. If you have true back or shoulder pain you are better off with a hand massage or standing under the shower. No power at all in this machine.
FM transmitters of this size don't last forever. That is a fact I accept but I had hoped it would last longer than 2 weeks. I bought my first one from Target before a road trip in a uhaul without a cd player. The sound was marginal at best and by the end of the three day drive to Oregon it was extremely noisy. I plugged it in to my computer to transmit some streaming stations and it had trouble hitting the receiver (direct line of sight) no more than 40 feet away. Two more days and it crackled its last and died. I exchanged the transmitter at Target for a new one and a week and a half later I was returning that one as well. Spend a few extra bucks, save yourself the hassle and get a Belkin.
I love this toothbrush, its easy and it really imporoves your gum health
I am a huge Thomas Hardy fan, and I was not disappointed with this book. At first all the technical astronomical information was slow, but the love story started and that was forgotten. My only complaint about Two on a Tower is the ending. It seems very rushed - everything comes crashing together in about 10 pages. It wasn't realistic for Viviette to age so much and no longer be beautiful 4 years later, considering she was only 33 at the end of the story. Sir Constantine was possessive, jealous and terrifying but she still kept her health and beauty after suffering with him. The bishop was full of himself - how is that worse? A few years with him and all of a sudden she's an old woman with a heart condition? Swithin comes back and says he'll marry her, she's overcome with joy and BOOM! She dies in his arms. I also find it strange that neither Swithin or Viviette acknowledged that the boy was his. Didn't people in the village realize who he looked like, since people were already suspicious of the lovers? What will happen next, Swithin takes his son in and marries Tabitha Lark? A very good, sad, complicated romance
A passionate home cook that has been honing her cooking skills for the last 25 years, concentrating on Italian cooking for the last 10 years, writes this review.  My favorite cookbooks are "The Professional Chef" by the Culinary Institute and "Culinary Artistry".  With more than 500 cookbooks in my collection I am typically disappointed by food magazines. ---  --- If you like watching America's Test Kitchen you will love this magazine.   The editors cover equipment reviews, cookbooks, develop new recipes in their test kitchen and pass along reader's tips.  If you love to cook, give this magazine a chance.  I think this magazine is better than the original that it emulated. ---  --- In the June 2006 issue this magazine features the following articles: ---  --- Weeknight Grilling --- Rich, Fudgy Brownies Two Ways --- Make Room for Basil --- A Shortcut to Juicy Chicken --- Chopped Salads --- Making the Best Quesadillas --- Cuisine:  Vietnam --- Berry Tarts ---  --- For those cooks that like to make everything, they even include a recipe for homemade tortilla shells (a foreign process to those of use without Latino heritage). ---  --- The editors include an easy to use recipe index in the front of the magazine that is segmented by type of recipe (appetizers, meat & poultry, desserts, etc.). ---  --- In short I have enjoyed every issue of this magazine that I have read.  I would highly recommend this magazine to anyone that is serious about cooking or eating.
Product performs per specifications and is easy to use.  Would like to see fuse easier to replace
When mated to a Sony wide-angle lens, the on-camera flash becomes partially blocked causing a dark area in the photo. A major flaw in my opinion. ---  --- Sony makes no mention of this on the packaging
Good grief.  Where do I begin?  We upgraded two computers from 6.0 to ACT 2007.  Prior to the install, we totally reformatted our hardrives and did a clean install of Windows XP.  We performed an XP update, installed MS Office and basically had two smokin' clean machines - more or less brand new.  Then we we installed ACT! 2007 expecting perfection. Our problems with the software have been: ---  --- 1) Miserable, buggy installation - barely worked. ---  --- 2) Inability to convert our old ACT 6.0 e-mail database into the new version of ACT 2007.  ---   --- 3) Slow, slow, sloooowwww performance. ---  --- 4) e-mails will delete themselves for no apparant reason.  This is the worst of all. ---  --- 5) Terrible syncing with the Palm.  Sometimes it works, other times it doesn't, overwrites data when it is not supposed to and vice-versa. ---  --- 5) Useless Sage tech support. ---  --- Don't buy this product.  In fact, I would never buy another product from Sage ever again.  My colleague has already ditched ACT! and switched to using the Palm Desktop and Outlook Express.  This was after losing all his e-mails.  If I lose all my e-mails again - I will uninstall and ditch my copy altogether. ---  --- I would love to reclaim the hours of my life lost to this poorly written loser of a program.
The ideas for the bottles interchanging is great. But unfortunately the nipples cause too much gas.  When they're using the bottle, you can hear constant air sucking in around their lips.  Every time my little girl uses them, it seems as though she just can't get comfortable with them.    I would recommend Dr.Brown's or Playtex VentAire bottles over any of these.  ---  --- Ultimately, the convenience and features aren't worth the massive amount of gas the avent bottles cause
I was surprised at what a good size this rug was.  It matches the bedding perfect.  The only negative thing I can say about it, is that it tends to scoot around a little bit when you walk on it.  I put it right in front of my son's crib and by the end of the day half of it seems to have scooted under the crib.  It could probably use some kind of gripping material underneath it to keep it in place
How come all the fun is for Chubby Bunnies like WHOLE milk? Don't skimmy girls have more fun? Then what about SKIM milk? ---  --- Why not 128 fluid ounces of Tuscan WHOLE milk, instead of SKIM milk? To get the full benefits of milk's yummy yummy eternal goodness, I'll let these experts tell you why. ---  --- "Less is more." Mies van de Rohe. ---  --- "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler." - Albert Einstein ---  --- "The absent are always in the wrong." - John Bull ---  --- "My illness is due to my doctor's insistence that I drink milk, a whitish fluid they force down helpless babies." - W.C. Fields ---  --- "Things are seldom what they seem, / Skim milk masquerades as cream." - William Gilbert ---  --- "Two percent black; that's like skim milk." - Own Smith
Like others, I was very pleased (initially) with the very quick installation of this router.  Since I am very familiar with Linksys products, working through the web utility to configure the router is a snap.  I was up an running inside 5 minutes.   Signal strength was awesome, and I had an iMac connected wirelessly with WPA security and an XP machine connected through the ethernet port.   Life was good......... ---  --- After a few days of blissful surfing, I tried to connect a Mac PowerBook pro to the network.   Bad idea -- would not connect unless the wireless security was turned off completely (another bad idea.)  After resetting the router a few times it made the whole system very unstable.   The iMac now loses it's connection every 15 minutes or so.   ---  --- Soooooo, once again I'm resigned to spending fruitless hours on a tech support line to a faraway land.   I purposely stayed with 802.11g because this technology is several years old and SHOULD be rock solid.  I found a forum at [...] that proved to me that many others are having DHCP problems with these routers.   ---  --- There's no excuse for having to spend this much time setting up a very simple network!  If I hadn't already tossed the box, I would be returning it for a refund. --- 
This remote is so hard to use and setup. The Xpress functions don't work properly and when used switches to different inputs each time. Most of the interaction with the remote is done on the touch screen so you have to look for the buttons, instead of being able to memorize their locations with your fingers. Get something else
The construction is shoddy, very bad quality leather, made in China. ---  --- My phone (Cingular 8525) would not even fit in it. ---  --- The design itself seemed awkward. ---  --- It went straight back to the Boxwave
While the book covers some interesting aspects of mid and high model rocketry, it is not as comprehensive as other books and dated given the advances in the hobby of the past years.  If you are looking for a book to complement your model rocketry library, this will be a useful addition.  If you are looking to take the step from basic model rocketry into mid or high power model rocketry, there are other books that better describe "how to". 
I had bought this before as a snack at the store and i love the combination of the beef and the white cheddar.  I figure i would try to buy it bulk instead of paying $2 a pack at the store.  However, I'm not sure if it was stored too long in the warehouse or if it was too hot in the warehouse, but the cheese was disgusting!  it was dry and crumbly and had this awful taste.  I even opened a second and third pack to see if it was a fluke, but all of the packages were like this.  The beef stick was good, however, if i had to order again, i'd order the product without the cheese.  It just was not fresh.  (and yes, i did check the expiration date and it wasn't expired
I love trying out new products for my hair and also happen to have slightly thinning hair on the top of my head (with receding corners).  After seeing this set at Sephora I tried it for a week and found the results mediocre.  ---  --- My hair, which is thin and not very abundant, did feel slightly thicker and had a plump look at the roots (especially the crown) but I am sensitive to smell and didn't like the man's cologne like scent.  The shampoo lathers up nicely but the conditioner is dense and doesn't spread well over the hair.  The mouse is interesting.  It definitely seems to make a difference in volume.  The overnight liquid makes hair a bit messy to sleep in.   ---  --- As is the case with any product, it may work for you but it didn't for me.  I believe in changing the body/hair from the inside out works better than rubbing niacin (vitamin b) topically to the scalp and hair. ---  --- I would recommend you try it.  You can always return it if you're not satisfied
These were on my mom's wishlist, so I bought them.  They just arrived and I'm totally disappointed.  I'd return them if it wouldn't cost me and I wasn't so lazy.   ---  --- They look pretty darn cheap, for starters.  Also, they came in a little, plastic zipper bag inside of a little, pseudo-velour bag, with a price tag for $3.30 on it. ---  --- Save your money.  It's best not to buy jewlery sight unseen
I love this Adobe product.  It works very well for me - only a couple of minor glitches - it keeps asking me to re-register - but that's only a minor annoyance.  Overall it is a very good product

I really like this peel.  It is very easy to use and I have noticed a difference in my skin.  It is clearer and the redness and discoloration is fading.  I even noticed my clogged pores are diminishing.  I recommend this peel to anyone.  I have very sensitive skin and it did not cause irritation.  I use this one about twice a week. ---  --- I also recommend the microdelivery vitamin C peel.  That one I use once a week. ---  --- Jennife
This bench went together quickly.  All the parts fit well and the instructions were decent.  Anyone with a simple set of tools and about a hour can handle it with no problems.  There are a few steps where a second set of hands help.  Craftsmenship of the parts themselves seems to be pretty decent. ---  --- However, this bench is simply not built for much weight.  It will wobble and flex.  It doesn't feel safe at all.  If you are serious about lifting you will quickly out grow the weight capacity of this bench.   ---  --- There are alot better benches out there for just a little more money
This cable did not fit my camera as stated.  Because of the cost factor, I chose not to return it.  The shipping was more than the cable was worth
I bought this after fidning my 2nd child who is 4 months old caught under the headboard bumper that came with his bedding.  This is my 2nd child & I have never been told of this danger.  I highly recommend this bumper.  It comes in 2 pieces, the shorter one goes across the front railing that you move up & down, the longer piece goes from the last slat on the headboard to the last slat on the footboard.  There are only 2 gaps which are where the handles for the railing are.  I was also able to weave a few places along the sides to make sure he couldnt get underneath.  I love that it's wide so that it reaches down to the mattress, it velcros at each end across both the top & bottom for a tight fit, it will collapse if an older baby tries to step on it but is still very tight & that it's very breathable but still has a little cushion to it. --- I just wish that I had known of the danger of traditional crib bumpers.  Thankfully I heard my son screaming when I did.  HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT, or one like it to avoid suffocation hazard from stuffed bumpers
The performances for every sonata and every partita are wonderful. This is the kind of material one can expect from Deutsche Grammophon. Wonderful music, a wonderful violinist, wonderful interpretations, and wonderful sound (not just for its time). There are also very few "squeaks" and he is almost always right on pitch! Often called definitive, this is the one to get. Highly recommended
I've had a subscription to PC World over the past few years (as a gift) and I love it.  The articles are very insightful and relevant.  I can always find at least one article in each magazine that helps me with a computer issue I'm having at the time or provides me with reviews on electronic devices that I'm looking to buy
It was awful! The reproduction of the music was grainy, scratchy and virtually impossible to listen to
I burned my hand, but it was ok. I got to keep 3 of my fingers. They work fine, but they're a bit too hot
This cd has alot of tight hits including: Nann by Trick Daddy and Who Dat' by J.T. Money. There are too many good songs to name for this cd, those are the biggest I like and I like all the others too. I can practically just  listen to the whole cd without stopping it, which usually never happens  with other cd's b/c u buy it for about 3 good songs and all the other songs  are junk. But this cd has all the Hip Hop Hits that it proclaims. I suggest  anyone looking at this review or cd, to buy the cd. It's worth it,  definetely!  One last word is that you will have no regrets buying this cd  at all I think in my own opinion.I am from St. Louie and I am telling ya'll  to look out for a new group called NELLY also, there hit single is already  out "Country Grammar" and cd soon to be out. Get that when it  comes out to. Peace out ya'll
I love House Beautiful!  It gives so many wonderful ideas.  This is a collection of ecclectic styles, patterns, and methods that will suit anyone's taste.  And these ideas aren't hard to follow.  With the smallest effort, anyone can follow the look they have in the magazine
Loaded easily, no glitches. the online account access feature became functional after running the software update. ---  The program is fully functional and I have suffered no inconvenience running this on an Intel-based Macbook.
The mouse itself is very nicely designed and cool looking. I use it with my Apple Mac G5. The optical tracking is great, no moving parts. The scroll wheel is indispensable for browsing the web and scrolling through documents. I just wish the software that comes with it would be more stable, less buggy. I had to uninstall it and use another mouse driver with more options, functions and less bugs
I had to repurchase this product, because my first one broke, the hinge that they use to attach the battery door to is pathetic, seriously a design flaw. However, with some Epoxy glue and a different type of hinge you can modify the origional product to be something better. In this case you really get what you pay for... Its dirt cheap plastic and it breaks easily. I wouldnt recommend getting this unless you need something dirt cheap and only plan on using it a few times.
Peter Balakian's book, "Black Dog of Fate," tries to be too many things --- and sadly fails at many of them. In essence, it is an attempt to tell a  --- sort of Armenian-American story which I find not overly interesting or ---  compelling. I wish the author had done a bit more in-depth work to learn  --- about his people and their rich heritage before embarking to represent it --- or explain it or share it with non-Armenians, for he has much more to absorb --- and understand himself first. I find the Armenianness in this book to be  --- tentative, unengaged and unconvincing. Pity, since the author seems to  --- have a lot of passion in his pursuit of other aspects of his life such as  --- football, the Yankees, modern poetry, and exposing Turkish attempts to --- buy (among others) Princeton professors to act as mouthpieces giving --- legitimacy to their vile historical revisionism, practiced by the  --- "modern" Turkish state and its organs. ---  --- It seems to be all the rage these days to elevate personal histories and  --- family testimonials into the realm of fiction and novels. The "I" and "we"  --- and "us" occupy center stage and the reader is invited to enjoy the  --- intimacy that must surely be in place via this artifice. But is it realy? --- Since in order to make this legitimate, the writer must distance himself, --- at least initially, from all this old world exotica, and like the reader, --- question their validity or relevance in present day North American  --- society. What are all these old world, old fashioned ghosts and traditions?,  --- is the first cry of writer and reader alike, only, ofcourse, to be followed  --- by a sharp bank turn where the writer steers the satisfied and in-place --- reader towards the opposite viewpoint wherein *this* culture and *this* --- lifestyle become suspect in light of some tentative spotting of cultural  --- wealth that has been traded in or abandoned in order to swim swiftly towards  --- materialistic, memory-free, self-redefining, "comfort" seeking and buying  --- mores. ---  --- In the Balakian tale, one encounters suburbia instead of substance,  --- worldly goods acquisition instead of deep roots that steady the soul,  --- immediate family and relatives running away from their true identities either --- towards surrealism, the abstract and unemotional, or else towards medicine, --- respectability and detachment. Young Balakian observes but never --- understands "the grandmother" for she is shielded culturally from being --- able to reach him by her very offsprings who can not and will not instill --- the Armenian identity he will eventually seek but never quite find. Their --- crime is self-denial and a march to the tune of America's mixmaster --- piper. "Be unlike your past and your future will be brighter," seems to be  --- what America promises, at the very least. The intermediate generation listens --- and adopts this credo and Peter is left to find out but never quite --- understand just what cost his ancestors have paid to remain Armenian and --- to preserve our culture before the final denials on New Jersey pateos while --- enjoying, as if to serve sweet irony, full course Armenian meals and the --- mixing aromas of delicacies from the old country every Sunday. ---  --- Peter is lost alright, but as the book sadly shows, he remains lost. --- Paraphrasing or quoting Ambassador Morgenthau does not an Armenian genocide --- expert make. Personal family testimonials of the Turkish atrocities does --- not a genocide history make (For that, read Vahakn Dadrian's "The History  --- of the Armenian Genocide"  Berghahn Books, 1995). Episodic accounts can be  --- dismissed by the Turks as hear-say and as mere isolated incidents, leading  --- to more harm than good (for if better evidence existed, the arguement  --- goes, why would anyone resort to such flimsy fare?). For the story to have --- worked, for the story to have *really* worked, as I would have liked it to, --- Balakian's life and lifestyle would have had to have changed --- significantly and his child rearing practices would have had to reflect  --- it, and his relationship with his wife who, like him, is not leading a strongly --- Armenian existence, would have had to have changed, solidifying his roots, --- celebrating his new found identity, and nurturing the metamorphosis by --- sustained community involvment and grass roots movement participation --- which, alas, never appear on the pages of this book. How else to explain --- the lack of a turning around of the tide of assimilation to which Balakian --- is a grand personal witness, except that the transition has not occured? --- The ship of Armenianness sails by Balakian. He is finally aware enough to --- be able to identify the ship and wave it goodbye and write about it, but --- not resolved enough to climb aboard. That is how the book fails and that is --- how his story fails. This is a story of assimilation and loss with a bit of --- mid stream self awareness thrown in. For a real story of an Armenian --- finding his roots and letting them take root in his own life and future, --- read Mark Arax's book, "In my Father's Name (Simon & Schuster, 1996)," --- where the transition is real and the early youth of disaffection is --- replaced by a profound adoption of our essence revealed in exquisite --- frankness and power by Mark Arax. One can only hope that Balakian's --- partial reorientation towards our culture and traditions and essence will  --- somehow continue and that some day he will wish to live with a more meaningful --- attachment to our cause and needs than merely as an able observer (not --- withstanding his laudible actions as an April 24th -- Armenian genocide --- commemoration speaker and an exposer of Turkish infiltration in the US --- academic arena by buying spokesmen turned professors who mascarade as --- unbiased researchers). This criticism I direct to the predecessor of this --- genre of American Armenian writing first and to Balakian second. I speak --- here of "passage to Ararat" by Michael Arlen (Hungry Mind republication, --- 1996) where a disinterested soit-disant Armenian goes to Armenia in the --- 70's and by the end of the short trip is somewhat more closely touched by --- this strange people's woes and dreams. Too little, too late, and always --- detached, is all I can say to these meagre displays of ethnic or cultural --- reorientation. Much more needs to be absorbed before the essence is --- transmitted to future generations to take and behold. ---  --- However, I remain hopeful that future transformatory stories and ethnic --- identity survival stories *will be* written which will show that the tide --- of assimilation and cultural abandonment are not the only outcome of this --- experiment of transplanting peoples and cultures to this continent we --- proudly call our home
Well, I just tried the Bundle Me (toddler size) with my 20-month old in our jog stroller for the first time today and I am disappointed because it is definitely already too small. He really can't sit in the bag unless his legs are bent, which he hates. Plus, when I have the bag pulled as far down as possible in the stroller (the only way I can get him in at all), then it only zips to just above his waist -- definitely not high enough to really get warm and snuggly. ---  --- I'll keep the bag for baby #2, but I'm really disappointed I can't use it with my not quite 2-year old.
When we first got the stroller, it pulled to the left significantly, but we got on the phone with Tike Tech and they were extremely helpful and accomodating. The stoller works great now.  I have taken it running with my two girls - it is very stable and drives smoothly
I expected something better from Godiva Chocolatier. ---  --- I am a big fan of both chocolates and coffe, but ---  --- Godiva seems to be making coffee that tastes like something ---  --- in between vanilla and chocolate. ---  --- I could endure chocolate creme and vanilla hazelnut, but  ---  --- this creme brulee coffee is just awful. ---  --- Godiva has to focus on their chocolates. ---  --- True coffee-lovers/connoisseurs will hate this coffee
I've had this camera for about 1 1/2 years now and it's been a tried and true companion.  I've easily taken over 10,000 shots with it and produced some really exceptional photographs.  The features that really set this camera apart are the 12X zoom, the image stabilization (a must with such a large zoom), and the rotating screen (great if you want to take a picture of yourself :)).  I also love the macro mode, I've gotten some great quality close-ups.  For most situations you can just stick it in auto mode and get great results, but the different scene modes are fun to play with as well.  Performs extremely well outdoors -- wildlife, sports, landscape, beach, etc.  ---  --- My only real complaint is its performance in low-light situations.  Pictures are grainy and the camera is very slow to respond, sometimes not responding at all.  Also it can eat through batteries fairly quickly -- regular AA batteries lasted me about 2.5 hours of continuous shooting (around 200 pictures) or less if I was shooting in cold weather.  I would definately recommend rechargable batteries. ---  --- Overall I've really enjoyed this camera.  I've used and abused it and apart from low-light situations (which I was rarely in anyway) it never let me down.  Both my grandmother and my great aunt bought one within the past 6 months and they rave about it
I love Glamour!  This has to be my favorite magazine of all times!  Granted the ads drive me nuts but I love the Do and Don'ts and all the clothes.  I am a shopping mogul!   This magazine is great for showing new trends and I love layering and almost always they are showing new ways of layering clothes and teaching you how to wear your clothes in a different exciting way.  I also enjoy the articles and life lessons as there is always something that I am interested in.  I read Glamour almost from cover to back!  I rarely skip articles!  If you like fashion and just articles on every life issues this magazine is for you! ---  --- **I have noticed a change over the last year in the magazine, but it is not terrible.*
Made in 1959, Douglas Sirk's Imitation of Life is still just as evocative and as gorgeous to look today as it was almost 50 years ago. It's a real cinematic treat, shameless tearjerker, and an unabashed melodrama that dares to confront head-on issues of racism and the problems of motherhood at the stage when one's teenagers - in this case daughters--are growing up and preparing to enter the world. ---  --- Lana Turner has never looked more ravishing as Lora Meredith, a young New York widow who will do anything to realize her dreams of Broadway stardom. Together with her young daughter Susie, they live in a squalid apartment eking out a hand-to-mouth existence, their futures fuelled by unfulfilled dreams.  ---  --- One day at Coney Island, Lora and Susie meet another a white girl Sarah Jane, who is being taken care of by a black woman, Annie Johnson (Juanita Moore), whom Lora mistakes for the maid.  When told by her that she's the mother, the surprised Lora falters but then accepts it without a question as if it were a natural thing that a black woman has a white child.  ---  --- The angelic and virtuous Annie asks Lora if she can come and help out around the apartment. Lora is initially hesitant - not because of Annie's race but because she's struggling and doesn't have any money to pay her a wage. Eventually, however, she relents and tells Annie that her and her daughter can stay for one night.  ---  --- At the same time, Lora meets the extremely fine-looking wannabe photographer, Steve Archer (John Gavin). Steve takes an instant liking to Lora and offers to marry her. But Lora is far too concerned with realizing her acting dreams to be stifled by a man and by marriage. Meanwhile, the saintly Annie is troubled that her daughter is ashamed of being black and tries to pass herself off in school as white. ---  --- Imitation of Life follows these characters throughout their lives, with Sirk piling on the sentiment and melodrama every chance he can get.  Lora does indeed become a famous Broadway actress, yet neglects her growing daughter in the process. Steve goes on to become a president of a large photographic organization, but has trouble relating to Lora's need to be independent and famous.  ---  --- Annie's heart is eventually broken, gradually worn down by years of emotional abuse from her daughter. Sara Jane is so angry at being labeled as black that she repudiates her mother and ultimately runs away. Annie always stays the subservient and loyal maid; whilst her best friend and employer goes on to bask in a lush and international success. The contrast of the mother's compensations from their conflicting daughters is the story's ultimate paradox. ---  --- Lora, Annie, Steve and the two girls seem to be victims of each other. They all want to follow their own dreams and forge their own paths in life even when it doesn't seem to be doing them much good. They are also surprisingly oblivious of how manipulated they are by the world around them.  ---  --- Lora gets her career but she's unlucky in love and terminally insecure as a mother, Whilst Sara Jane - perhaps the most damaged character - achieves her ambition to pass herself off as a white girl, but at great personal cost to both her and her aging mother.  ---  --- Under Douglas Sirk's accomplished direction, Miss Turner et al acts ornately and elaborately, everything is over emphasized to within an inch of its life, especially Lana's gorgeous outfits, yet the film - clocking in at over two hours - is always compelling and is never boring.  ---  --- The screenplay is sophisticated, the themes are brave and tempting and the look of the film - the brilliant surfaces, audacious colors, and the spatial complexities of 50s moderne architecture - bring to the forefront a bittersweet world of fantasy, entrapment, and emotional anxiety, and where the price of following one's dreams eventually comes at a harsh and desultory cost. Mike Leonard June 06. 
There are enough reviews of the main movie story so I don't need to add anything in that regard.  But, what on earth does a lesbian sub-story (in both regards) have to do with the story as a whole?  Nothing.  So, we have another movie that would be great to introduce the whole family to blue-grass music and the Appalachian way of life that, instead, heads for the trash bin
Reincarnate can be a hard shampoo to get used to, especially if you're not already using LUSH products. It doesn't 'sud up' much, and feels a little bit muddy and grainy. Don't fret though! It will certainly clean your hair, and will also leave it smelling like wonderful spices (almost as good as "Arabian Bright"). The highlights are not something that come with one or two washings, but with many many washings, and they are /very/ subtle but there. The only reason I don't give this product five stars is that it was not as conditioning as it states it is, and I needed to use another conditioning product with it
We ordered this case/auto mount for our Philips PET710 7" Widescreen Portable DVD Player because it was the one recommended by Amazon.  I needed the auto mount for long car rides with my toddler.  I eventually got this thing to work (failure was not an option if you get my drift), but it has a number of drawbacks. ---  --- -In order to mount it, you have to remove the top half(huh?).  Having two parts makes it harder to install and easier to lose.  I accidentally left the top part on the top of the car when I drove away. ---  --- -It's too small.  The Philips portable DVD player is too long for the case and the headphones and car/ac converters also pull the player out of the case.  Plus (and this is really amazing), it does not have enough space to hold the most basic accessories that came with the DVD player.  I have to carry the headphones and sleaved DVDs seperately! ---  --- I chose my last DVD player b/c it came with an auto mount case, and even though I like the Philips DVD player, I'd do that again if I had it to do over.  Having the right case/mount for your DVD player is that key
I know it takes eight weeks and maybe longer but I do appreciate the information that I've gained from store bought "Maximum PC" magazines.  I don't build computers but when I do order one, it is nice to be familier with the workings and attributes of the new computer. --- Yes... you can find much information on-line and generally faster than the amount of time it takes for the magazine to reach your mailbox, however, is great to kick back away from the computer in your favorite chair and 'read' about it :) --- A very good magazine... but 'adult' language used at times does not appear to me as professional use of the english language. --- Thus the 4 rather than five stars
This is one of the best semi-futuristic movie ever.  And for all you Shadowrun lovers out there this movie has the same type of erie-ness and finess to it.  By far Keanu Reeves' best performance to date
great shirt for working out in. Clears away all the sweat and is loose fitting
Though I was daunted a little by the reviews stating problem with installing the game I went for it and I don't regret. I bought the Platinum Edition and it installs all right. The good thing about the platinum edition is that you get three games at the same time.  ---        Would not say it's one of the very bests available in its category but it's interesting and fun. About graphics, though the details are not great, still I liked the 3-D view, specially the view through the eyes of the main character(Hero). ---        Story is so so. Dialogs are specially bad. But the fact that you have to follow certain clues and talk to people and find out useful information is good idea. A sort of combination of RPG and RTS. ---              I like the units and the way they fight. Also picking up artifacts or weapons is good.  ---         Overall it's a nice game. And the platinum edition is specially good as you get lots of hours of gameplay
I use the extension cable that came with the adapter to extend the GPS-360 device further down the dashboard. This adapter apparently can't sustain the weight of its own extension cable leaning against the clear plastic cradle. I've only used it twice - first time, it snapped off the back half of the cradle and the second time finished off the front half. The connector sticking out of the adapter still works with the cable, but I'm going to try and super glue the cradle back together before using it again. I don't want the connector to snap off next
when it comes to buying camcorders, i personally like the one with the build in memory. but after using this camcorder i was forced to change my mind.  --- unlike other sony camcorders, first of all, it offers upto 40x zoom which is a lot. its a good use of your money. you can have it for under $400 and still works better than a lot of choices out there. easy to use, touch screen, takes still photos, has a good speaker so it's easier to record video and voice, fits into your palm so to speak, and if you use rewritable mini dvds, you wouldn't have to worry about go out of memory.  ---  so when it comes to sony camcorders, i would say the better quality of this one would get the job done properly.
His basic thesis is that a liberal empire can be a greatly positive force in the world, and that the United States is already an empire, but that our inablility to acknowledge the fact leads us to waste our opportunities to be the afore mentioned positive force. Ferguson writes that America is plagued by an attention deficit disorder and too much love of the good life. Thus, we get distracted too easily from important events overseas, and when we do try to intervene, we want quick fixes and low costs. ---  --- I couldn't agree more with most of these points. As an American, I'm greatly ashamed of our collective ignorance. I hate feeling like a foreigner in my our country because I watch the news or can find Sumatra on a map. Also, the book strikes a chord with me because of my frustration with half measures in foreign interventions. Countless times, I believe America has done more harm than good by, if you will, talking the talk but not walking the walk. If we commit to something, we need to follow through. This is as true in Iraq today as it has been in the past. We've claimed to support democracy in Latin America, but then turned bannana republics into bannana autocracies. We greatly prolonged and increased Vietnam's suffering without changing the end result at all. ---  --- With all this commonality, however, there are a few leaps of logic that Ferguson makes that I can't bring myself to agree with. Basically, he didn't sell me on the thought that the imperial model is the best way to develop the world. How are we supposed to know what is best for everyone? Won't our own biases and self interests inevitably distort even our most altruistic efforts? ---  --- When Ferguson hold's up the British Empire as a model of success, I can't help but notice that the best results came only to those places of British colonization, with horrendous consequences for each of the native populations there. And the two greatest examples of beneficial American imperialism - Japan and Germany - were already highly developed before World War II, so it probably wasn't that much of a wonder that we were able to help them return to such a state. ---  --- Even if the positive power of empire is conceded, there are important differences between the state of world during the British empire and the state of the world now. It's a concern of immunity from repercussions. In the golden age of imperialism, Europe was in a kind of splendid isolation from its empires. Not to say that there were no reprercussions, but, with the only modern navies in the world, Europe was immune to any very serious threats. On the other hand, in today's world, as an effect of globalization, power has become more decentralized in some respects. Think WMDs,terrorists, and foreign investments in the U.S. economy, for example. Can America as easily afford to make enemies in the developing world as the British could? ---  --- In the end "Colossus" didn't settle any agruments for me, but raised new and interesting questions. It is a book that makes you think, and that in and of itself is worth four stars.
This item is not as functional as I thought.  I miscalculated the size which is not big enough for my purpose.  Also, the brittle like surface is cracking and peeling off. I was going to exchange or return the item but the packaging was discarded too soon
I purchased these shoes as a Christmas gift for my husband.  He's been wearing it a lot.  He says it's comfortable, and he has not experienced the squeeking from the shoes as some other reviews had pointed out.  I was hoping it has more of a dressier look.  It really looks better with jeans and not as good with kahki's
Up to you, but I would buy a generic branded battery of the same type (Lithium BP522).  I bought a generic battery and it works just as well -- saved me $50 
The Lands End 60/40 Oxford is THE dress shirt to own!  It is the end of the line in your search for an excellent product!  I buy nothing but this shirt, and have multiple shirts in each color made.  I've worn a shirt and tie nearly every day since I was 16 years old in prep school (35 years now), and the Lands End is the best.  I highly recommend this shirt
The shipping for this product cost more than the product itself.  It was packaged in a medium sized box and would have fit easily into a small padded envelope. 
This game is a great way to pass twenty to thirty minutes.  It is very easy to learn and does not have any pieces to lose, or money to count.  The strategies, however, are numerous, and there is an equal amount of luck as skill involved in good gameplay. ---  --- I really liked how the game could ONLY be played with two people, as I was tired of games that COULD be played with two, but which were really meant to be enjoyed by three or more... ---  --- Game Contents: 1 deck of game cards, and one small board.  Note: If you want to make this game really portable you don't even need to bring the board.  It is just a place to put discarded cards and a way to help organize your cards.  As long as you have a pencil and paper for scoring at the end of the game, you can play it everywhere that you have a table.  (I figure you need as much space to lay down your cards as the size of a typical Monopoly board). ---  --- Playing Note: One thing that was initially a little confusing to us when we were reading the instructions, was that the instructions do not explain that you are to place your cards on the opposite side of the board as your opponent.  You can each play all 5 expeditions, in a head to head manner.  We were sitting on a couch at a coffee table, and we had turned the board horizontally to face us (instead of vertically) and the instructions were confusing until we moved the board 90 degrees.  The game designers assumed that you would play the game as one would play a game of checkers, sitting across from one another, but you don't actually have to play this way, even though you DO need to turn your board for the same effect. ---  --- This game is really fun and I would highly recommend other games from the same manufacturer (Rio Grande Games).  They really have a knack for publishing great strategy games.  They even release expansion sets to their popular games, and they credit the players who gave them the ideas for the expansion cards.  Pretty neat
When I got this product out of the box (I hadn't seen one in a store before), I was surprised by how lightweight and cheaply made it appeared, particularly at the price they charged (about $80 at the time).  The box I received was also missing the insert for the iPod nano, and the nano won't sit securely in the iPod socket without it.  I returned this product, and for about the same price, I got a much more solid--and better sounding--boom box with an auxiliary input jack that allows me to play songs from my nano (though admittedly without the remote that allows you to scroll through your iPod songs).  This wouldn't be a bad iPod speaker set if you could get it for $20, but at $80 it's dramatically overpriced
Still have not received an issue yet. Please give me an update as to when the first one will arrive
I bought a 3 user Zone Alarm Suite for far less than Zone Alarm offered for a single user upgrade. It pays to shop around, and Amazon is often where it all winds up
This paper offers a wonderful broad perspective, and great national coverage. Doesn't take too long, but always has plenty to read. Every american should read this paper. And every adult should check out the "New Sex Now" dvd
I love this magazine,it is my favorite of all of the scrapbook magazines out on the market.  It has an all-around appeal with great and creative ideas, ways to delve into your creative mind, tips and tricks, and of course beautiful layouts to look at. This would make a great gift for a beginner or advanced scrapper.
I never received this magazine so how would I be able to rate it??  I cant even find a way to let them know I never received it
I've been wearing Philosophy's Falling in Love as a regular fragrance and liked it so much that I decided to give some of their other products a try... Pure Grace has been a lovely find! I spray a little on a blouse or jacket and have that lovely fresh-washed scent lingering all day. It compliments the Falling in Love scent nicely, as both are fairly light, but I love it on its own as a nice change of pace as well. So far it has been just as advertised-- clean, soapy and crisp-- and I'd add that it's just one of the most comforting smells around... makes me want to curl up in a pile of warm towels fresh from the dryer and take a little nap
I have been in the housekeeping business for six years. I ran out of my stainless cleaner today and used my clients. It is the best I have seen there is absolutely no effort to apply this product and the results are fantastic. Two thumbs up for sprayway stainless steel polish. You have my business from now on
I picked this up because it's considered a classic and I knew it had been made into a movie.  I tend to think that if a book is made into a movie, then the book must be pretty good.  Not so with Howard's End.  The plot in Howard's End doesn't progress much outside of an early death and later marraige.  You have to have some interest in the characters, but they just weren't very believeable.  None of characters convinced me that they could be people from the real world.  I kept waiting for someone to say anything that might border on being interesting, but everyone babbles on and on about nothing of any substance.  The story is clearly dated and doesn't hold up well so many years later.  Living in today's world, it's hard to understand what attracted Margaret to Henry.  There definately is an audience for this book.  I'm just not a part of it
I purchsed this video a few years ago and was also very disappointed. I have nothing more to add to the other reviews posted here; just to agree that the sound was poor and the viewing quite fuzzy. I remember watching not only the first broadcast on NBC but several broadcasts years after that, with different casts. It was and still is my favorite Christmas story. I will certainly purchase the Schippers CD and hope to see another video or DVD in the future
I'm going to start this review by saying that I came to the Wii as a lifetime PC-only gamer. I have never felt the need to buy a console until the Wii and its fun controller system came out. The aspect I was most excited about was controlling first person shooters just as precisely and intuitively as the mouse and keyboard, together with the added entertainment of using it for other motion-activated actions within the game (rowing, throwing grenades, close combat, etc). As a result, after spending the night out in the cold to get my console, and flushed with excitement at seeing all the merchandise, I grabbed three games: Zelda (a no-brainer), Trauma Center, and Call of Duty 3. Of those three titles, I'm sorry to say that CoD 3 was the one to leave a bitter taste in my mouth.   ---  --- As I have stated before, I am a PC gamer; I'm really into my hobby, and love the satisfaction of building a PC which can manage all the latest games. I played CoD 1 and 2 on the PC, and greatly enjoyed both. By far the biggest problem with the Wii version, however, especially as someone accustomed to playing on the computer, are the graphical shortcomings of the title. I literally had no idea what was going on. I could barely tell which direction the enemies were coming from and the only reason why I was going in the right direction was because of the linear construction of most of the levels. Added to this, I had no idea how to get rid of the first German to engage me in hand to hand combat (a much advertised feature, which is actually just an interactive cut-scene). I followed the instructions to wave my controllers around wildly, and although I worked myself into a frenzy (causing my dogs to panic and think something really was attacking me) that inevitable German (I tried throwing all my grenades into the room he hides in) kept clubbing me to death. Even beyond this setback, I found that the controls were often quite poorly implemented. It is also disappointing (yet speaks volumes) that the grenade 'throwing' function that involves you actually 'throwing' the nunchuck (without letting go, by the way, unless you've got a backup TV) is disabled by default; trying to use it usually gets you to miss your target/get cut down/ blow yourself up. For the record, I know that the Wii controller works. I've played many hours of other games already (as the system conveniently informs you). This just seems like a shoddy implementation of it. ---  --- I can definitely tell you that there is a lot of ambition here to convey the frenzy of war, with some obvious strong attempts at creating absorbing combat scenes. Nevertheless, it essentially boils down to being a messy soup of blurry pixels which, even to my gameplay-over-graphics mentality in buying the Wii, blocks the enjoyability of this title. To be honest, it has made me think that WW2 isn't the best-suited area for the Wii. After all, these historical titles tend to rely a great deal on cinematically portraying the visceral splendor of war, rather then pushing exciting new gameplay elements. My advice on the FPS front: wait for the Wii 'Far Cry' game and see how that turns out. In the meantime, there are countless hours of other great titles more suited to the Wii graphics waiting for your attention.  ---  --- Before leaving you, I'd just like to clarify on thing: this is the perspective of someone who has very little experience with consoles. Perhaps you're reaction to the game will be very different if you come to the Wii straight from a gamecube instead of PC/high definition gaming. ---  --- Oh, and if you're still determined to buy it, keep an eye out for my used copy of the game; I'm going to need the money for 'Banana Blitz'..
this album had two good songs at the most. ralph was good with new edition. it's apparently obvious that he can't stand alone. bobby should have been the lead for new edition. then we may never have seen this terrible album. ralph isn't that good of a singer. this shows that just because your the lead singer in a group doesn't mean you are the best. ralph is miles behind bobby

I like this product a lot. My hair type is curly and frizzy specially after the hair gets dried up naturally after the head bath. I used this product and my hair looks good now. It looks smooth and straight now and I can feel the softness when I touch my hair. I definitely will recommend this product to my friends.....
We had to move it about our place in a few different windows before we found one that actually got the radio waves (and we know our directionals here).  So, if you get it, just be patient and leave it overnight in a few different places before you give up
LONG TIME LOYAL COSMOPOLITAN READER RATES 5 STARS ---  ---  ---  --- I've read COSMOPOLITAN and HELEN GURLEY BROWN since the 60's and never miss a month.  Along with skads of other magazines I enjoy, Cosmopolitan manages to have some fun fashion, fun & hip dating articles, fiction and true stories, and lots of quick reading ideas.  I've never thought of it as a "health" magazine as another reviewer thought of..it's been an iconic reading for the EARLY SEX in the CITY set.   ---  ---  ---  --- "Sex and the Single Girl" by Helen Gurley Brown was a breakthough book in its day, letting women in the 60's know that it's perfectly okay to chose career and other paths in life than the one society forced on the women in that day.   ---  ---  --- Cosmopolitan has been the singles bible that confirms that it is okay to be single and thriving and adventurous in your life.   I can see where this would irk men that want to REPRESS women, --- or WOMEN that have subdued to their REPRESSION, but if that's not you...then keep the COSMOPLITAN's coming.  Catch up on some great women and what they're doing.  Educate yourself on women's health issues, --- Find out what men like...a few tricks..check out the fashion, new make up tricks, and new products, and never stop learning. ---  ---  --- Personally, I plan to read it forever.  There's something for everyone in it.  And it has inspired me for decades. --- Thank you, Cosmopolitan
I really enjoyed this coloring book--as in my very early yrs., I had kaleidoscopes to play with.  I was always intriqued with the color spectrum in them.I was hoping to find more on line with the illustrator of this book.  Sadly disappointed.  Will keep looking at other book sites. By the way, I am 56 yrs. old--and I love to color.  It's wonderful therapy for relaxing and bringing back some childhood fun
I must say I enjoyed the book, but the ending was so sudden, with so many things left hanging, that I was disappointed.  I wish one more chapter had been written to clear up- how did Manderly catch fire, what did they do when they got to the burning house, and how did they pick up their lives. All we had at the ending was ashes. Also, the narrator, who never gives her name, was sometimes very odd- hiding behind doors in her own home, sneaking food, hiding behind chairs. The book is worth reading, but I wish that, instead of spending so much time describing the trees and the sea, Du Maurier had written a better ending.
I was really disappointed with this entry even though Jason Takes Manhattan isn't much better! The DVD treatment is way to good for this film. If you want to complete the Friday series it should be seen as it does set up for the Freddy VS Jason movie.
Just wanted to let others know this info that I found out after reading the tip given by the reviewer about getting the table for a lot cheaper at Costco ... ---  --- I called Costco and they carried the KIDKRAFT art table with two stools back in January of 2006, and will no longer be carrying it.  You can find it at Walmart for $66 plus shipping, just check the website.  The table is not the same however -- the dimensions are different, the sides of the tables is slightly different (on one side of the Kidcraft table has two cups and a mesh basket in between the two cups, and the other side has a space where little legos can snap onto).  The stools are also tiny compared to the ones that come with this table. Overall it looks a little less substantial, but since I haven't seen it in person, I really can't give my opinion. ---  --- Hope that helps someone
Why do some people call Bratz dolls 'sluts/slutz'? Are you guys mad? They are just dolls. They are made of plastics. So what they wear SHORT mini skirt? They just DOLLS. If you hated mini skirt soooo much, well don't wear them. --- I saw many teenage celebs wear mini skirts. --- THEY ARE JUST DOLLS, okay? No need to argue if they wear short mini skirts.  --- Anyway, about this doll I am totally adore her. She is very pretty and very ROCKSTAR material (I don't know how 2 spell.I don't care about her having tatoos. Lot of celeb got tatoos and she's a rockstar material.
I can hardly express in words how I feel about these bears.  Haribo Gold-Bears are absolutely charming.  They're a little taste of heaven.  I like them frozen
I have tried many different wiper blades on both my car and my wifes. I thought I take a chance on these after reading some of the reviews. All I got to say now is, WOW! These blades are whisper quiet and clean the glass so well I am very impressed. We had an overnight sprinkle and when I got into the truck the next day the spots were all dry, a few quick wipes with the washer fluid, and it was almost crystal clear!! 5 year warranty, these have to be the best blades out there!
Well, nice cinematography as set-designer work: nicely interiors and well dressed actors. Maybe, visually it is enough to keep you watching this movie once, but not enough to consider it as a remarkable  movie of year, as other reviewers trying to assure
This is why sony is hot! This sexy little (yes its really small the size of a pack of cards) it takes perfect clear and crisp pictures and the battery life is a long 320mins perfect for a vacation, make sure to get a memory stick with it though, because w/o it it only holds about 15 pics. This is my first digital camera and I would definitely buy sony again
I love this movie as I have seen it many times.  Audie Murphy did a great job in playing himself, although it must have been really hard to relive. ---  --- A movie that I would highly recommend.
I had an Amazon reward certificate and was looking for something practical to use it on.  It so happened that I needed new tweezers.  I read the reviews and thought I'd give these a try.  Wow, I can't believe the difference in quality from any other tweezers I have ever owned.  They almost seem to adhere to whatever your are trying to grasp.  It is so easy to precisely and almost painlessly remove even the finest eyebrow hair.  Tweezerman Tweezers ROCK!
wow this scope goes great with the UTG Master Sniper. It works very well when you tune it in
Same thing happened to me as the person from the previous review.  They sent a pink pillow instead of the crib set, and will not honor the same price for the bedding set.  I have to send it back and they will give a refund.  What a hassle
I just recently bought this game for about $10 dollars.  I had always heard is was awsome but had never even played an xbox(I've been a PS2 fan for a while).  After I played the first couple of levels I was not dissapointed.  This game is simply amazing even today, I can't possibly imagine how good it must have seemed back when it came out.  The gameplay is terrific, and so are the graphics.  The sound and music to the game is awsome.  I highly recommend that this game is bought and not just rented because it is well worth owning
Avobenzone 2.0% , Homosalate 15.0% , Octinoxate 7.5% , Octisalate 5.0
This is hands down the best star wars game i have played or seen. Just the fact that you can use almost every hero and villian in the star wars movies makes this a blast to play. The addition of the space combat is what really tips the scales on this title. When you're flying through waves of tie fighters and you land on an Imperial star destroyer and begin fighting through control rooms, you begin to realize this game is really special.
My daughter is 2 1/2 years old and I often find myself surrounded by some loud toys that jingle or sing.  After dinner I find that this book is a wonderful transition into our bedtime routine.  She has learned how to button, use a zipper and problem solve by using this book.  Also, I find that this is a great toy to keep in the car when rush hour traffic becomes horrible.  I have bought this book for many of my friends children and would recommend this to anyone who has a toddler since the it holds up extremelly well no matter how hard your child plays with it
It is the declining days of the Great War (WWI), the Germans are leaving a small French town but are leaving a little present for the advancing British troops.  They have buried the munitions in the town square.  When the town hall clerk strikes midnight the bomb will be exploded.  The town's people evacuate.  During this the barber sends off a message to the British. ---  --- The British decide to send a man to check this out.  They choose the bumbling Scottish Private Plumpick (Alan Bates).  Located on the outskirts of town is an asylum.  The sisters who run the asylum escape with the town's people, leaving the inmates to fend for themselves.  They return to the town, resuming their lives before being commited. ---  --- Plumpick arrives in town but doesn't know that the towns people are actually the lunatics from the asylum.  He meets the beautiful Coquelicat (Genevieve Bujold) and falls in love with her.  He finally puts everything together and defuses the bomb (of course it's more complex and hilarious than just that.)  He also finally puts together that there is something wrong with the town's people.  The funny part is he feels the lunatics have a better grasp on reality the sane people.  So shall he return to the war or stay with people he loves. ---  --- This is half fairy tale and half fable.  Alan Bates gives a great performance and Genevieve Bujold shows great whimsy. ---  --- DVD EXTRAS: None
This book helps toddlers put into context how they fit into the animal kingdom, and the natural things all animals do. It teaches them to be comfortable with - without shame - the move from being a diaper-clad baby to a big kid. The drawings are charming! I bought this book for a friends who runs a day care center and got a very positive reaction
Truly this is the magazine of the warmongers, the neocons, who would gladly repopulate America completely with non-Europeans, except for the neocons themselves and their cohorts, who are of  "a race of the mind," as one wag put it, by and large. ---  --- Pro-war and anti-American people (and certainly anti- Euro-American people), this magazine is truly one to be boycotted.  If you are an American of European descent THE AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE will more likely be for you.  If you are racially aware and don't wish to see your people vanish from the Earth, I would also recommend THE OCCIDENTAL QUARTERLY. ---  --- To give the devil his due, TWS does carry some interesting book reviews at times. ---  --- If you love your people, as long as they are not from "the race of the mind," do not buy this magazine, and if you already subscribe do the smart thing and cancel for a refund, as I did a few days ago. ---  --- Highly recommended as antidotes to this warmongering propaganda are two outstanding collections, NEO-CONNED! and NEO-CONNED AGAIN
This was a gift and was lovely and beautiful. Not too big, not to small. Delivery time was great. Strongly advice to buy this
I am very happy with the Emjoi Compact Epilator that I purchased.  It does exactly what it claims to do and works wonderfully. Until I asked a salon for advice on the best way to remove unwanted facial hair, I didn't even know something like this exhisted.  I just wish I would have known about this product years ago. ---  --- A. Davis
I bought this watch because of the stylish looks, the reported reliability, and the fact that it was a watch that would never need batteries.  There were also other functions advertised that appealed to me.  I have owned Casios before and they took extreme wear while still maitaining their function.  This watch I have now will not allow me to go more than five days without the solar battery running out - usually at inopportune times where I really need a watch!  It has become very unpredictable.  Please do not get me wrong, it is a nice watch, I have gotten many favorable comments.  But I want a watch I trust to work day-in, day-out and not one I am constantly worried about.  I guess for someone who has the time to set the thing out in the sun on a regular basis, it would be a good purchase
All of these people complaining about horrible picture quality must have some pretty crappy TV's. ---  --- I mean, it could be that I have a 20-inch Sony Trinitron and the Halo special edition XBOX, too, but.... ---  --- I have had absolutely no problems with it and neither have any of my friends (in real life), or anyone in my CounterStrike Clan (on XBOX Live) that have old TV's and regular XBOXes ---  --- RECCOMENDATION: If the picture is crappy, buy a new TV
I never buy stuff like this on line.  I like to play with/feel wallets before getting them.  But I couldn't find a thin, bi-fold that I liked, so I took a chance. --- It's great.  The ID feature is super handy (it comes all the way out if you're wondering).  And the brown leather is soft and nice.  It is really nice for the price. --- (By the way, personally, I don't think it's thick at all)
Got it for 20 bucks on cyber moday. Easy to configure and use. Nice sound quality. Only con being a loose fit around your ear and has to adjust it constantly to fit correctly
This movie is not a war movie. It is not remotely related to history either. Guadalcanal was not like this as anyone who knows the people who fought there and the history. Since when did American troops in WW II carry pliers around to extract gold teeth from dying enemy soldiers? This depiction is just simple minded and pure excrement. Enemy soldiers all hugging around and teary eyed over war is hell? Can we spell Bushido? Mallick can't.  ---  --- Now, if you like touchy, feely, not the real world aesthetique, have at it. The scenery and photography is quite good. 
HAD TO SEND BACK THE FIRST PAIR BECAUSE I NEEDED A BIGGER SIZE. RECEIVED THE SECOND PAIR AND CREDIT FOR THE FIRST PAIR PROMPTLY. THIS PAIR IS JUST RIGHT!!! WILL DEFINATELY --- ORDER AGAIN. THANKS
I have owned a pair of these boots for three years now and they are still going strong. I work in construction and find these to comfortable boots whether I am on site, at home, out on the town, etc. These are really incredibly made considering their 40 dollar price tag
good shaver lots of battery life quick charge lots of trim setting and gives a good uniform cu
I bought this camera to replace my 35 almost a couple years back.  I am an avid nature photographer so most of my work is taken in the outdoors.  After hundreds of pictures and all kinds of weather here's the lowdown... ---  --- Pros ... Picture quality is amazing even after zooming the full 10X (I never go into digital zoom because of low quality of pictures, although this camera isn't too bad after complete full optical and digital zoom).  Prints that I've made up to 16X20" (haven't gone larger, but I know I can) are extremely impressive and are as crisp as viewing a 4x6.  It is easy to use and the functions are easy to get to with the use of the joystick.  The stabilization at full 10X zoom is incredible also.  It appears really shaky through the window, but pictures continue to turn out crisp.  Close-ups are clear and reveal amazingly clear details.  The movie feature works better indoors than the regular camera portion (read cons). ---  --- Cons ... Indoor shooting is limited because the flash isn't strong enough.  When at a school chorus concert, the pictures turned out fuzzy and unclear.  Award ceremonies, the pictures turned out once again unusable in my standards.  The zoom is fixed when using the movie feature so you need to have the zoom set before beginning a movie.  This camera seems to eat batteries, especially in the winter months.  I am always on the go, and when I go to pull out the camera I find the camera lens cover has fallen off yet again.  It comes off way to easily causing smudges and smears on the lens so I must always have lens cleaner wipes on me.  The viewing window cover has also come off and is lost in the woods somewhere, but that also is minor. ---  --- Most of the cons really are all minor things that don't interfere with the amazing quality of the pictures as long as you are properly prepared for those minor issues.  I tried to be as precise about this camera as possible.  All in all, I would highly recommend this camera to the avid photographer.  If you plan on using a camera on mostly indoor activities, just keep in mind for the flash to work good, keep your subjects close.  It's been bumped, jostled, and droped a couple of times and the camera still works like a gem
I am a coffee afficionado! I'm a pickey coffee drinker and only use a french press to make my coffee from the freshest beans I can find. I keep my coffee beans in the refrigerator and grind them fresh moments before making my daily cup of coffee! This coffee was great and I have tried a million different brands!!! Organic and fair trade is important to me!!! Thanks for the extra effort! I wish the big guys would make this kind of effort!!!
I bought this as a gift for a friend and she loves it.  It is a great color and texture and really like the mesh cut out for breathability.  I think I may order one for myself
I have seen Al Jarreau 20 times in concert (and recently saw Al and George perform at the Hollywood Bowl) and am a long-time fan from WAY BACK. There are a few Al CDs that you just play forwards and backwards (and back when they were cassettes, you wore out the tape) because they're just PERFECT. "Breakin' Away", "Jarreau" and "Heaven and Earth" come to mind. Well, add "Givin' It Up" to that list. If you're an old-school Al fan and you're wondering whether to buy this CD, BUY IT. It will live up to all of your Al expectations. There's a "Look the Rainbow" feel to it, there's a "Breakin' Away" feel to it, there's a "Jarreau" feel to it. There's even a "Glow" feel to it (when you think about tunes like "Milwaukee" and "Have You Seen the Child?"). Grassroots Al. ---  --- It's got the production values of "Heaven and Earth" and "Tenderness". FABULOUS production, arrangements, gathering of talent. There is not one song on here that you will skip as you're listening to it driving to work or whatever. In fact, if you're throwing a party and want to instantly get people in a jazzy party mood, put on this CD because between everybody from Chris Botti to Jill Scott to a SOULFUL Paul McCartney, people will stop and say, "Wow, listen to Jill and George tearing up 'God Bless the Child.'" And "Is that Paul McCartney tearing up 'Bring It on Home to Me'?" [Yes, it is.] Meanwhile, Al and George are working their magic the entire time, and guests will say, "Listen to George right there." And, "Al is jamming right now." It's a conversation-stopper provided by the best thing that can stop a conversation at a party: fabulous music that people must comment on. Of course, that's where the conversation picks right back up, so you win either way. The blend is perfect: Just a touch of scatting, just a touch of voice-beat, with lots of fabulous jazzy vocals by both Al and George, tons of great music solos, and George playing a perfect guitar. ---  --- If you're a George Benson fan, you will be THRILLED with this CD because George provides a fabulous through-line to every piece. He's ever-present with every wonderful thing he ever did on a guitar. He fronts many of the pieces, and he's not in any way relegated to "background guitarist." He IS the music in every piece, with few exceptions. As much as I love Al, this CD is MAGICAL because of the blend of George and Al. ONLY THESE TWO CAN PAIR UP TO MAKE THIS KIND OF CD. There IS NO OTHER TEAM who could have pulled this off. You need Al's voice and George's guitar. Period. In fact, I'm guessing much of the jazz music world is a tad jealous right now of how simply GENIUS this CD is, as in, "Dang. These two are GREAT together. Wow." ---  --- Bottom line: This is a perfect blend of these two greats' talents. George takes care of the music, while Al provides the wide gamut of vocals he's an expert at (and that only he can provide). If you've been a long-time fan of either of these two, you won't be disappointed. It's not lopsided. And it's OLD-SCHOOL in every good way.  ---  --- My prediction: This CD will sweep the Grammys. If it doesn't, there is no justice. Like another reviewer on this page, I intend to buy this CD for about EIGHT people. It's just THAT perfect
I bought this book before my first trip to Austria. I had a  --- sinking feeling while reading it that it was mostly a  --- pastiche of unusable generalizations. That turned out to be --- true. What shall we do with a paragraph that tells us that --- Austrian women are strong-minded and independent and  --- organize their homelife well, although many go to work? ---  --- This book might have some value for a person who had never --- left their english-speaking homeland before and needed to  --- be warned that people are sometimes naked in the sauna --- or at the beach. It also provides some amusing anecdotes --- about language (especially viennese) and useful info about  --- festivals. ---  --- Mostly, though this book was good for reading aloud to --- Austrian friends. I would quote it as an iron-clad  --- authority when their behavior didn't quite match the  --- book's version and thereby amused them tremendously. ---  ---  --- --Lynn Hoffman, author of THE NEW SHORT COURSE IN WINE and --- the forthcoming novel bang BANG from Kunati Books.ISBN --- 978160164000
This clip is great and it doesn't just work on UTG guns it works on smith and wesson shot guns. Any one with a shot gun from UTG or smith and wesson should buy this ---  --- Ps. I'm 1
I realize this isn't an expensive bra, but I expected it to at least FIT! I've never ordered a bra that was sized this crazy! The band was way too big and the cups were way too small. Needless to say I'm returning it. Save your money, ladies! ---  --- On top of that, it took almost a month to receive it because it was out of stock. Even though Figleaves displayed the item as IN STOCK. This is the third time Figleaves has done this for Amazon items. I think I'll skip buying from them in the future
It's not the best grill in the world, but for the price it does the job well enough.  It cooks unevenly.  The front and the back of the grill are hotter than the center. 
The figure was sent back for a replacement because the legs did not fit into the body, it was defective.  The same problem with the replacement and it was returned as well. 
One of the nicest things someone did for me when I lost my husband to leukemia was to send me this book.  The selections are sympathetic and inspiring.  Also, they're short at a time when the mourner really can't concentrate on long selections.  This book has helped me through the most difficult time of my life
I previously wrote a review for this and only gave it 3 stars. But after watching it again, I realized I liked it better (I do agree with the reviewer below me in that it does grow on you). I do not consider all of the performances goth. Martiya Possesion are more tribal than anything(at least on this video) and I really dislike the expression, or lack thereof, on their faces while they are dancing. They either look completely bored, pissed off, or smug. I skip right over it.  ---  --- I also did not care for Asharah's dance to the drum solo by Solace ("Opaque"). The dance mood does not match the mood of the music at all. The music is saying "fast, big, upbeat" and she's standing there doing taxim moves and small quick moves. ---  --- And of course, we all love the S&M piece...excuse me, S&M is NOT part of the Goth subculture, and has no place on a bellydance video. Jehan may be a great and accomplished dancer, but she didn't dance much on this and I didn't want to see what WAS on her part. ---  --- Another thing I would have liked to see is more GOTH music. I like Solace and all, but there were a lot of songs by them on this video and it would have been nice to see some more pieces done to music from the Goth genre. There were a few, but not enough for my liking. ---  --- My favorites on this video were Tempest, Ariellah, Jeniviva and Ayshe (for wierdness factor). For all of its faults, this is a good video to be inspired by and I will use it for that purpose
Monkey Business looks pretty good on DVD 50 years later.  The restoration comparison on the DVD shows the change the restoration brought, a bit darkly tinted, and more defined.  The wild plot keeps you glued to the screen throughout.  Marilyn Monroe who is the star on the DVD box has more of a supporting role here.  She is great as the secretary Lois Laurel who shows up early because the boss doesn't like her punctuation.  Cary Grant as the addled Professor Barnaby Fulton turns in a great journeyman performance, getting appropriately loony when experiencing the euphoria of youth.  His driving sequence with Monroe had me turning in my chair with laughter to avoid the trucks!  Ginger Rogers as wife Edwina gets pretty wacky when returned to youth.  If all youth were as lighthearted as these comedic versions, it'd be a laugh and guffaw every time the school bell rings.  Hugh Marlowe as the straight-laced attorney Hank Entwhistle does a nice job of standing stoic during the crazy Indian game.  Oscar winner Charles Coburn (1943, The More the Merrier) does a great job of appreciating Monroe's assets as Oliver Oxly, the CEO.  Kathleen Freeman as Mrs. Brannigan gives a fine performance. The DVD offers perviews of many Monroe films.  This is a great little piece of cinematic history.  Turn back the clock & enjoy
We bought these because there was an online coupon for them.  My children (ages 11 and 14) take lunches to school and I was looking for something beyond the usual chip choices.  The price was right and with the free shipping when going over $25, it was hard to resist.  The fries are light and airy, like a thin cheeto but with a more delicate flavor.  They are a nice change and we're really enjoying them
Walzer's historical approach to examining just war theory is, I think, the most useful way to understand morality in war. That is so because empirical facts back up all the philosophical evaluations. Walzer describes experience and draws conslusions here; he is laying a philosophical foundation and implying, if not prescribing, moral norms from which the rules have been extracted. Be forewarned, he does not cut the reader any slack. This book requires some serious attention to the author's train of thought.   ---  --- Just war theory has two categories: the justice of going to war, and the justice of fighting once in a war. Walzer's discussion usefully and clearly separates the two and examines via historical events what we regard as right and wrong within each sphere. In doing this he has done the modern world a tremendous service. His logical breakdown speaks to thousands of years of tradition about what thinkers have considered right and wrong in war. One of the best outcomes of this landmark work is the complete debunking of the notion that "all is fair in love and war." That is the path of least moral resistance (or as Clausewitz would say, "friction"), yet we all know that soldiers are honored for fighting well and loathed for behaving like armed thugs and murderers. What is amazing from the discusion is the realization that Walzer knows he has to attack that age-old notion, something our collective sense of justice has historically always rejected.  Yet it remains a prevailing idea for many.  Originally coined by the Romans it seems (Walzer quotes them, "In war the laws are silent"), they themselves were self-consciously contrite over the fates they inflicted on the Greeks and Carthginians.  The book rates five stars for rigorously addressing this issue alone. ---  --- Some make the mistake of thinking Walzer is a pacifist--far from it.  On the otherside some critics find his argument about "supreme emergency" a moral failure and a cop-out.  The case of Nazi Germany is his paradigmatic case of supreme emergency, one where normal rules may be relaxed, if ever so little, because of the especially pernicious nature of state-sponsored genocide.  The same relaxation of restraints would likely apply to Islamic terror. In contrast Walzer does not see Imperial Japan, for instance, as having represented a supreme emergency, and so the atomic bombings and the fire bombings of cities could not be morally justified. Readers may want to compare his view to Paul Fussell's perspective in the essay "Thank God for the Atom Bomb." ---  --- Significantly for current events, readers interested in the distinction between pre-emptive and preventive war will find a well articulated argument here. The US attack on Iraq was and still is often justified as pre-emptive.  That impulse on the part of the neo-conservatives who devised or whipped up the casus belli reflects, I think, a need to cloak a morally questionable war in the robes of legitimacy. There is no way that attack can be justified under the historically accepted norms of "pre-emption." Michael Walzer's well-thought distinction between pre-emption and prevention makes sense even in the milieu of asymmetric warfare against terror and Islamic radicalism, and it clearly shows why the Iraq war was a moral mistake from the start, regardless of its practical success down the road, if we are fortunate enough to see that. The moral precedent of engaging in preventive war will continue to haunt America long into the future. The fact that Iraq was not even on the spectrum where the fine line between pre-emption and prevention exists is a telling aspect of the overall ongoing strategic fiasco.  Where one fails to recognize the moral high ground, one is doomed to moral failure. Walzer was vocal about the run-up to war in 2003, and those who read his book would do well to find his comments about the Iraq invasion; they are edifying in terms of understanding the overall argument and where we are going in this role as the world's police force
I did not get the crossover tube in the box like the picture shows. I had do modify one of the tubes so it would work with my old crossover. Go to weber in the future to get what you need , its worth the extra money
So this movie is made of 2 stories.  The first one is quick and involves Takeshi Kaneshiro and Brigitte Lin.  Both have their stories and I actually found Kaneshiro more interesting.  So this thing ends and the movie should have also.  It should have been a 30 minute movie.  So for the next hour or so we get to watch Tony Leung Chiu Wai sit around his apartment in his nothing but a white tank top and his briefs.  Wow, what a movie.  The only positive to the second story is the girl who listens to the same song all day.  She was fun to watch but I still wish I wouldn't have seen this dumb movie.   
The toy is a lure to a social networking website for little kids.  They play games against "friends", who are strangers on the web.  They "chat", but only with preapproved messages.  There is always a reason to come back to the website tomorrow and play some more. ---  --- I don't think teaching little kids to keep coming back to a website is particularly healthy.  I REALLY don't think teaching them to interact with strangers on the internet is a good lesson, no matter how sanitized the interactions might be on the Webkinz site. 
I just received the gauge and I'm returning it after trying it for 2 minutes: ---  --- - The hose didn't seal well on the tire valve --- - WHen bleeding air, the display didn't update. You have to remove the hose, wait 10 seconds for the display to turn off, then plug it back to the valve stem and get a reading. This is ridiculous. --- - The display is on for 10 seconds and then it turns off itsel
Excellent book - telling a shocking but real story of genocide on an unbelievable scale.

I bought this drive from PCuniverse on Amazon and I am generally happy with the service I received and product quality, I have not used it for long time yet but have managed to fill up most of the drive. The speed looks good even over wireless network. I also like the Truecrypt encryption software bundled which is actually freeware; seems to be quite capable an usable with any drive (USB flash or disk drive, look at [...]It seems much better than the software that comes with many flashdrive in terms of capabilities. I am surprised that there is not a lot of competition in the 8GB flash business yet possibly because people don't need it. I had a Corsair 1GB drive from 2 years back and it worked quite well; upgraded to 8GB as my data requirement grew
From the moment she glimpses her idol on Broadway, Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) strives relentlessly to upstage Margo Channing (Bette Davis).  Cunningly, Eve steals Margo's role, smashes Margo's best friend, Karen Richards' (Celeste Holm) marriage, and becomes the toast of Broadway!  Great performances all around with some of the juiciest, wittiest, and oh so quotable ("Fasten your seatbelts, it's going to be a bumpy night") dialogue ever!  I don't know if the film would have worked as well without the suave and sophisticated performance by George Sanders (Rebecca (1939), he is truly remarkable as the story's narrator and Broadway critic, Addison DeWitt.  This film also marks the screen debut of legendary beauty, Marilyn Monroe, who plays a bit part as Addison's lovely date at Bill's welcome home party.  Even here Marilyn's astonishing screen presence and simmering sensuality (of which she would later ride to fame on) is clearly evident. ---  --- "All About Eve" has been hailed as "One of the smartest pictures of all time....a picture for any era" by the L.A. Times, and Variety put it simply best as "Captivating!"  It's interesting to see Bette Davis and co-starring romantic lead, Gary Merrill (who play's Margo's lover Bill Sampson) play out their scenes together, for in real life they actually marry and similar odds ends their relationship.  It's all told in the included Special Feature, AMC's "Backstory" telling all about "All About Eve."  Anne Baxter and Celeste Holm are featured in the interviews and give some interesting insights on the film and it's "behind the scenes" antics.  Bette Davis and Gary Merrill should also not be missed in the 1952 suspense classic, "Another Man's Poison."  A new dvd release of this picture would be much appreciated, for the current release is discontinued.   ---  --- Also included in the Special Features is the film's Gala Premiere footage / 1951 Academy Award footage, in which "All About Eve" won 1950's Best Picture / Theatrical trailer for "All About Eve," "Gentlemen's Agreement," and "How Green Was My Valley," are also included.   ---  --- If you're a classic movie buff, you don't need to be told anything about "All About Eve," you will have already discovered it a long time ago.  I don't have to tell you how essential it is to add it to your dvd library, for you either have it already or have placed it on order -click "add to cart" NOW!
The camera fits perfectly. The case is very stylish.  Best of all, its Pink
This pasta is very good.  It works great in salads, casseroles or regular pasta dishes.  I've only been gluten free for a few months and I think this tastes very similar to wheat pasta.  Granted, I've only tried one other kind of gluten-free pasta (made all of brown rice) but this pasta is FAR better and I like it enough that I feel no need to keep shopping around and trying other kinds
I sent this to a friend and with free shipping who can beat the price. My mom saw it and said it was wonderful.  I will definitely purchase again
I LOVE Destiny's Child...BUT this CD...big disappointment. The best songs on the entire CD were probably Lose My Breath,Cater 2 U and Girl...big disappointment...i just wasnt feeling the CD when i bought it..
I'm not sure why I never watched "Ghost" before until last night.  For some reason, I didn't pay much heed to it when it was first released and never thought it was worth watching on TV.  I'm glad I gave it a chance because this is a GOOD movie.  What makes it good is its' skillful mixture of suspense, romance, comedy, and the supernatural.  That would seem to be too much to tackle for one movie but we get it all in the right balance.  I was drawn rather quickly into the movie and got to where I couldn't wait to see what was coming next.  There were a few "convenient" capabilities that these ghosts had that were necessary for the story to work.  I'm a rather pragmatic person but, by the time these things came up, I was so caught up in the story that I WANTED these things to be possible.   ---  --- Obviously, the writer and director deserve accolades for their work and the actors do as well.  I wanted to make note of the quality of acting because it was probably the cast that left me uninterested in watching "Ghost".  I was prepared to be unimpressed in particular with Whoopie Goldberg so I want to confess that I thought her Best Supporting Actress Oscar was well-deserved.  I figure that I was one of the last persons in America to see "Ghost" but if there are others of you out there who still haven't seen it, give it a look; it's well worth it
very excited to get an alarm at a good deal with free shipping but that all changed when i tried installing two beeps and then nothing i have spent over an hour of tring to get this to work and i tried new fuses but "no go" to sum it up the two orginal beeps is all i got from this product besides stress. NO GO
This is by far the best design magazine anywhere. The price might be daunting but, beyond being on the bleeding edge content-wise, issues are typically loaded with custom papers, finishes, a fold out poster, postcards, and other generally inspiring material. If you are tired of yuppie design rags and are looking for great work that spans an incredible range (every month), this is it. Not for "8 ways to better drop shadows" types. This is the real deal
The Best of Taste compiles material from their 4 official albums released from 1969-72. The albums consisted of two studio albums "Taste", "On The Boards, and the two live albums "Live Taste", and "Live At The Isle Of Wight".  This band was a power trio led by Rory Gallagher before he disbanded the group to embark on a successful solo career.  The band led by Gallagher on vocals, guitar (electric, acoustic, & slide), harmonica, and alto sax specialized in hard hitting blues rock.  The music has much in common with Cream.  However, the Richard McCracken and John Wilson could not compete with the stellar musicianship of Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker.  The undervalued Gallagher is an unsung guitar hero whose work compares favorably with that of Eric Clapton.  Like Cream the band favored extended versions of tunes like "Sugar Mama" and "I Feel Good" included here.  The music included here is varied.  It ranges from the slow gut wrenching version of "Catfish" to the more acoustic cover of "Leavin' Blues".  The cuts from "On The Boards" become more jazzy at times.  Tracks like "On The Boards" and "It's Happenened Before, It'll Happen Again" highlight the band's more improvisational approach.  Hard hitting tracks like "Eat My Words" spotlight Gallagher's outstanding slide technique.  Two cuts I miss from this period which are not included here are "Dual Carriageway Pain" from "Taste, and "Morning Sun" from "On The Boards".  The live concert favorite "Sinner Boy" provides a bridge to Gallagher's solo career as the studio version was included on his first solo album "Rory Gallagher".  This anthology provides a great overview of the early work of Irish blues-rock guitar hero Rory Gallagher and his battered Stratocaster.  It is even more essential as the four original albums are only available as imports
Jack doesn't pop up after only a few weeks of owning it.  Don't waste your money
I bought the 4600 for my parents in 2005. A seal in the lens housing broke in November and we sent it to Nikon.  When Nikon recieved the camera they said it had "liquid" damage to the lens shutter area. My parents didn't send the camera in that condition, yet Nikon claims that it is "impossible" for that kind of "accident" to occur at their facility. Two months later I am still arguing with them over this. One of their service represatives, Rob Mustard, told me (paraphrasing) "I have 70 service orders in front of me and our facility gets hundreds of repairs each week; I've heard every excuse imaginable for why it isn't the customer's fault." Besides being rude, doesn't that scare you about his facility getting in hundreds of repairs each week???? Don't buy Nikon is my recommendation.
We gave this set to my Dad for Christmas and he was very impressed.  It has plenty of sturdy, all aluminum tools and the case is awesome, too
I love this bottle dryer.  It was a little pricey but worth it! It holds a lot of stuff and is not in the way on the countertop.  I never put bottles, binkies, etc. away anymore.  I just leave them because it is so convienent
Since I had never purchased a watch by Croton, I did not know what to expect.  The watch came in 2 boxes, the first being a black cardboard box detailing the Croton brand in silver on the top center of the lid.  Inside of this box, the watch itself is encased in a nice padded black leather case with the Croton name embossed on the top center of the lid.  On the inside of the lid, there is a "pocket" that stores the instruction guide and a warranty card, which is neatly concealed behind a black piece of material with the Croton logo in silver text.  Needless to say, I will feel good presenting this gift to my boyfriend. ---  --- The watch itself has substance to it.  The shape of the watch face is unique as it looks like a more rounded rectangle. The face is blue, and what is nice is that there is a bit of light texturing on the face.  The blue color seems to change from dark to lighter depending on the lighting in the room.  The numbers are clearly visible, but the date is a bit on the small side, but not terrible.  When I took the watch out of the case, I noticed that it was not running and at first, I feared that the watch battery was dead.  This was not the case however, I found that the watch pin on the side was pulled out, which had stopped the watch.  I am not sure why this was done, perhaps it is done to conserve the watch battery?   ---  --- The back of the watch has the Croton name etched into the center and underneath, it states that it has a sapphire crystal, Japanese quartz movement and the water resistant details. As for the bracelet, it does not seem to be as heavy as I thought it would be, but I will have a better idea after my boyfriend tries it on.  However, I am expecting that he will need to get the watch sized to fit his wrist, but this not at all surprises me as this has been common practice with many of his watches.  As other reviews mention, the instruction booklet is not for this specific watch and is not so helpful.   ---  --- All in all, I think this is a nice watch.  Its design is simple, yet elegant.  I think it will be a good business casual watch, as it can be dressed up for the office, yet be worn after hours and on weekends.  Another nice feature is the fact that it is water resistan
Great phone ... durable and so far dependable.  I did buy a larger battery.  There is one complaint, sometimes the person you call sounds like they are drunk.  I don't know if it is the service or the phone
The pro and cons described by other reviews are valid. I was specifically looking for a boombox that has cassette, mp3, cd and radio capability. So didn't have much of an option but to get this one. I am impressed with the sound quality but agree that there could have been improvements related to interface and some of the functionality. Overall I think its a good buy.
pretty decent utilitarian paddle.  i think this is a better deal than all the other low end paddles out there, since shipping cost was zero
The plot is good but there are about 200 pages too many.  Why a full chapter to tell us what the protagonists are thinking about the attach case, when we already know it was not in the car and we could tell them where it is? We know where the precious document is : another useless quest. People are murdered by the half dozen, the characters are outrageous, most of the time improbable, and I felt the semi-erotic swimming episode totally stupid, not to mention the girl apologizing constantly about it. --- I have read much better books than that. Sorry..
The Belkin TuneTalk is fabuous for using an iPod as a digital recorder. I have had very good results recording various music rehearsals (children's choir to big band) with and without an external powered microphone (Sony ECM-MS908C stereo mic) attached. Since I already had the mic, the total cost was very low compared to purchasing something like a Zoom digital recorder for this type of recording. I haven't plugged it into a mixing board yet. I suspect it would produce an even better recording with a decent pair of mics through a Mackie 1202 or better. ---  --- I bought a USB power adaptor so I wouldn't have to worry about battery drain. It plugs into the TuneTalk and provides power to the iPod. ---  --- No, it isn't as good as a high dollar recorder, dedicated mic-pre's and a pair of Neumann mics. Serious recording requires serious equipment. However, for all those other recordings, the Tunetalk Stereo is a great recording option for about $60 and your trusty iPod.
This three-part television production by the BBC, released in 1999, is one of the finest films you'll see in a while.  The acting is brilliant, especially the performance by Lindsay Duncan, the direction is extraordinary, and the plot is most unusual (if improbable).  The production is flawed only by a weak musical score. ---  --- The real question is: How did this superb film ever get made, in a media devoted to pleasing teenagers and adult sickos?  Don't miss it
This was my first GPS system of any kind.  I wasn't sure what to expect.  I have a small Mazda Miata so I wanted a small-screen GPS that did not overwhelm my small dashboard and this did not disappoint.  I was afraid that the screen would be too small, but it's perfect.  I don't think a bigger screen would do anything more than take up more space.  --- I live in New York City and before putting it in my car I walked with the GPS unit in my hands.  Perhaps because of the tall buildings and the slow walking speed it took more than 30 minutes for it to initially receive a satellite signal.  I was convinced it was defective.  It's not.  Once I put  it on the dash of my car and began driving it acquired a satellite signal within a few minutes. --- This unit comes with a 128Mb Micro SDcard onto which you can load a few state maps at one time.  I ordered a 1Gb Micro SDcard along with this GPS (for approx. $11 on Amazon) and loaded ALL of North America at one time. This eliminates the need to re-load maps when traveling anywhere in the country. It's worth the extra effort. This unit can be quickly moved from one car to another, especially a rental car anywhere in North America.   --- My very first test of this thing was on the very complicated underpasses and overpasses in northern Manhattan and the Bronx.  It was flawless!  It's impossible to get lost with this thing.  Occasionally I've made a turn too early or too late and within seconds it will re-calculate the best route.  The combination of the voice prompts, the highlighted route you need to go, and the current and next street(s) at the top are excellent. Also, the estimated arrival time in the lower left is nice, but does not account for traffic jams.  The arrival time will just keep getting pushed back the slower you travel.  It's kind of a "best traffic scenario" prediction. --- This is so easy to use I'm thinking of buying one for my 68-year-old mother who doesn't have a clue when it comes to technology, but I'm convinced she could use this without a problem (once I've loaded the maps for her.) --- If not having bluetooth and all the other latest bells and whistles on a GPS system doesn't bother you (as it doesn't bother me) buy this, you won't be sorry!
I got this perfume in a set of 4 ohter perfumes from Estee Lauder. This one is really special...so good..light.. I loved this perfume more than all the others that I got in the set - pleasures was one of them.
Melrose Larry Green's book is full of quotes.  Quotes and information used to back up points are good things.  He appears to have researched by surfing the Internet, watching television and legally incorporating the opinions of others.  This is all fine and acceptable. ---  --- The problem with "Why the Clintons Belong in Prison" is when the author (cut and paste expert) attempts his own narrative, which is sporadic, jumpy and poorly edited.  His points are not linear, and show the author's attention deficit.  With a proper literary team, this book could have been something of note but unfortunately it feels like a "hit and run" report and reads like a one-sided sensationalized talk radio program.  
My wife loves this magazine so I bought her a one-year (6 issues) subscription through Amazon.com for $25.60.  That turned out to be a foolish and impulsive move on my part when I found out that I could have subscribed directly from Healthy Cooking for $14.95 for one year or $19.95 for two years.  Although I have realized significant reductions on book costs, clearly this magazine subscription is excessively priced.  I will shop more carefully in the future.  
not a bad typing program for kids.  it keeps my kids interested for about 15-20 minutes a day.  they complain about all the practice pages for the games...but , hey!  it's a typing instructor!  you gotta pratice! once they start playing, they have fun
We subscribed to this magazine, in part due to the special offer of 12 free cycling booklets & road log with each new subscription.  What did we get?  A note letting us know that unfortunately "the gift described in the promotion is no longer available" and that "rather than keep us waiting, (they've) taken the liberty of sending the enclosed substitute..." The substitute?  A crummy little pamphlet.  ---  --- I let it slide at the time, but several months later they were still offering this special promotion, so I wrote a letter to customer service stating that "since they now had the special gift, perhaps they'd be so good as to finally send ours."  No response. ---  --- Time came to renew and all of a sudden there was that offer again... so against my better judgement, we did.  And guess what!  Another note "unfortunately the gift described in the promotion is no longer available..."  and the same crummy pamphlet!   ---  --- In short, if you're interested in being lied to, or receiving a stupid little pamphlet, by all means subscribe... if you want what you paid for, go somewhere else.
No more worries about being too short and missing the bowl.  Yea!!! 
These mats are easy to use, and pretty durable, but I find them to be too slippery.  Not enough friction.  A thin rubber surface would be much better
it says it's an A/V dock for video ipods but it only would transmit audio to my tv. i'm really pissed about this product.what a waste! A/V cables that sell for 20$ are incredible. they sinply plug into the headphone jack of my 80 gig ipod and into the a/v inputs of my tv
You better know how to use a chromatic tuner if you buy this because the "instruction" booklet doesn't bother to tell you. I've got red and green lights flashing at me--have no idea what all this means
If you can smell the chemicals being emitted by these slippers than your child is breathing them in! Also the chemicals are being absorbed through the skin of your childs feet.  They are made with known cancer causing chemicals. They are also manufactured over seas wher the DEQ,EPA etc; have no jurisdiction over the processes used to manufacture these slippers.  My two year old daughter was given a pair and they are now hidden in the garage. Did not want to put them into a land fill until some one has analyzed the toxic emission from these horrible smeling slippers. Benzene, Poly Vinyl Chloride, all kill the liver.
I love this game, it is so much fun.  Even though my wife does not like it I recommend this game for anyone who like Mario Kart games. ---  --- Enjoy the races, and don't forget to blow your friends up
My daughter had this when she was a teenager. Now my grandchildren come and play the game she had. To preserve the original game I ordered new ones to replace my daughters game when she had it. The grandchildren, all 6 of them, love playing this game at our house
I work at Best Buy and we install this piece of garbage all the time.  For one its a huge system hog and two it doesn't catch much of the pesky spyware.  Also when computers come in to be cleaned up, no one uses this program (even though we're "supposed" to recommend it).  I would recommend xoft, pest patrol, or MS Antispyware much much more. 
I came across this watch on a Friday sale at well over half off, a great price. The features were more than adequate for telling time; dead on accuracy, plus date and day. I figured setting the watch couldn't be too difficult, there are only two buttons, so I purchased it with a gift card, totally painless. ---  --- The watch arrived a few days later and I had it programmed easily within 5 or 10 minutes. The watch band is pretty long so I had to remove a link from each side to fit, no special tools are needed. While traveling, setting the time zones is easy as city codes around the world are listed on the back. The wave ceptor function works fine in Boston and in Europe. ---  --- I usually wear more expensive watches than this, but this one looks great,  much better than in the picture. The specs say it has a metal case, but it doesn't. It has resin buttons, case, and back, but with some metal cladding. The band is all metal
This phone is a great corporate phone.  It is the best windows mobile phone currently available, in my oppinion.  ---  --- They overlooked a few features:   --- -There is no LCD light to tell you its charging status - instead the screen has to be on all the time.   --- -There is no way to know when the num lock key is on - so you just have to press a number key and see what comes up. --- -In order to unlock the phone, you have to press the on/off button at the top of the phone, which is not in a very convenient location. --- -The track wheel feels pretty cheep
for the price, not a bad piece of home gym equipment. cushion could be softer but overall it works the back & abs real good.
I own one of these, it came packaged in my Dell XPS Renegade. Sound in a Windows environment is good, as indicated by other reviews. But in a gaming environment for example World of Warcraft, and not just this game, I and other user's have experienced the squeal of death, wherein the sound will become replaced with a high pitched squeal, and may hard lock your computer. Either way this can only be corrected by rebooting. Check out the forums before buying any creative labs products. BUYER BEWARE!
I am quite dissatisfied with the quality of the new Leatherman tools.  I purchased two Leatherman Squirt S4's and the Leatherman Micra from Amazon recently and was surprised to see that all of them arrived scratched up(like it was used before).  Some scratches were wide and deep enough to cause cuts on your hands when you use the tool.  I purchased the Leatherman Charge XTi from another vendor, which was also not of high quality that Leatherman was once known for.  I have owned the original Leatherman Wave since it first came out and have had no problems with it.  It seems like the newer models are being mass produced without some type of quality control.  Or maybe someone is repackaging used Leatherman tools and selling them as new... --- I will not be buying anymore Leatherman tools until they start making high quality multitools as they were once known for. --- If you want to buy one of these, either for yourself or as a gift, I would suggest you go to a store and look at it before you buy.  Make sure there are no scratches or smeared letterings or any other problems...The ones I recieved were definitely not good enough to give as gifts
I had the distinct pleasure of seeing Richard Jeni live a few years ago and I gotta tell you that I really almost peed my pants. He was astoundingly funny. This DVD definitely captures his comic genius, although it is woefully short compared to the amazing talent that he is and that he expressed in the huge amount of material he developed. ---  --- It was incredibly sad to see that he took his own life which, from what I heard, was based at least in part on the fact that he was not able to get the gigs he used to get, which is itself really sad. He developed what I think is the best comedy, which is comedy that stings and bites because it reveals us human beings as full of weaknesses that are, ultimately, pretty stupid in the face of everything good in this world. ---  --- He will be sorely missed in this world that needs more people to show us all the dumb things we do...and by doing so, how we should and can be a lot better than we are
In the classic and disturbing 1972 movie Deliverance, Lewis (Burt Reynolds) gives this ominous warning to Ed (Jon Voigt): "Machines are going to fail. Systems are going to fail. Then... survival." ---  --- What, I wonder, will Richard D. James (a.k.a. Aphex Twin, a.k.a. AFX) do when the machines fail? ---  --- It's been nearly five years since his underappreciated album drukqs, where we got a tantalizing possible answer to this question: the plaintive, lovely, Satie-esque acoustic keyboard nocturnes intermingled among the abstract, frantic electronic soundscapes throughout its sprawling duration. [Another intriguing solution was proposed on the album Acoustica: Alarm Will Sound performs Aphex Twin...] ---  --- Chosen Lords, RDJ's first proper CD release since then, is actually a collection of various tracks from his "Analord series" of overpriced, elaborately packaged 12-inch vinyl singles that he's been cranking out over the last year or so. Those who were put off by the excesses and overt eccentricity of drukqs may hail these cryptically titled, drum-machine laden compositions as a "return to greatness." Indeed, AFX is certainly reviving a more compact, accessible (for him), and straightforward style here, with comparatively regular (though not quite danceable) rhythms and those comforting underlying simple synthesizer melodies. ---  --- I have to say, though, that there's a disappointing and somewhat melancholy sense here of a great musical mind spinning its wheels. By returning to such familiar ground he seems to be setting up systems and letting them run their course in an almost cynical way, without any of the maniacal glee that was once part of his singular musical personality on unforgettable releases like Come To Daddy, Windowlicker, The Richard D. James Album, and, yes -- drukqs. Notably lacking are the voices that once regularly appeared in his productions -- true, they were usually rather unsettling, distorted, and manipulated voices, but at least they added some welcome humanity. Also missing are those rare but beautiful moments of repose (ballads?) such as "Flim," "Nannou" and the striking piano interludes on drukqs. ---  --- In the end, Chosen Lords, while an undeniably interesting and expertly produced collection of electronic music, is nonetheless a sterile, static, joyless affair. If it inspires any emotion at all, it will probably be pity and sadness as you listen to a possible musical genius coasting along without exploring any new directions for the first time in his otherwise remarkable career. ---  --- Yes, I'm afraid the machines have failed Richard D. James, and I sincerely hope he can survive in this cold and remote musical wilderness of his own creation..
I am a bit disappointed in the quality.    It looked like a possible reject off the factory line.  There are threads uncut and the velcro was sewed wrong in one of the side pockets. --- You really should not expect too much.  You may find something better quality in some of your local cheap department store chain.  
I bought this game a couple months ago and I absolutely love it! I am 14 and kids and parents of all ages will LOVE ths! it's great excerise and very challenging with cool music. It's like DDR, only with your hands. Try it, I promise you'll have a great time, I could play it all day
The learning curve on this watch if you use it for fishing may take some time.  The moon phase is nice to know about and the sunrise and sunset is pretty cool too, but I didn't give this watch 5 stars because for the money it didn't give me the one option I used more than any other on previous cheaper watches, a timer.  This one has the stopwatch but there is no timer you can set for say 10 or 15 minutes.  It keeps great time so far, but that's typical of Casio.  The backlight is very bright, enough so that you can almost use it as a flashlight, and the option on this model where you can set it for the backlight to come on everytime you hold your arm a certain way is cool.  If you're looking for a good water proof timepiece and you don't really care about the timer issue, this is the one.  And yeah I'm vain about what it looks like on my arm; it looks manly and cool
I used this product for a couple of months with no visible result. In addition it's quite greasy and since it's not made to be used on the face, we can understand that. But that makes it very hard to use along with sunscreen and whatever makeup one chooses. 
I'm a fanatic for gummy candy, especially the sour kind. But most sour gummy worms look and taste like a chemistry experiment, and most apple and (especially) apricot fruit(ish) rings taste artificial too. Haribo does a much better job; their pink grapefuit was my favorite gummy until I discovered these apple ones. They taste natural, real healthy apple flavor, less stridently sour than grapefruit. Now it's a tie for top place: apple and grapefruit. When I can't decide, I eat 'em both together. My dentist taught me that trick, believe it or not. I sometimes wonder whose side she's on...
Yes it does go and come off your head easier than most swim caps, but it doesn't keep your hair dry at all
I don't own any other superman movies but this one and it was a really good movie even though it was short.Some of the parts were funny with joker in it and some were with action were superman fights batman and that part was my favorite and the voice of superman which was voiced by Tim Daly and superman's voice was okay.This movie was the best that I rented it a few times and decided to get this movie on DVD and recently I found this at eb games for [..] and it was the last copy they were selling,oh and here is my favorite line,''It's over,Joker''.That line was a good line and I never heard joker call superman ''supie'' and that name just made me laugh,but still this was a good movie and the charcters of this movie were not so bad after all and this movie is highly recommended to any superman/batman fan
I purchased this for an Oktoberfest party, there was a lot left over, mostly because people were slightly intimidated or mostly really drunk.  The sweet tasted nicely and were decorated in a very pretty way.  I'd recommend this to anyone who doesn't want to make their own marzipan and needs to purchase a large quantity.  There are several little "flats" of the candies so you can package them seperately or give a flat away to a friend easily enough
This is first Canon product that has disappointed me with its quality. They must acquire them from their Chinese supplier for about 98 cents. This plastic device wobbles even when fully rotated to the detente position. I bought it to use with the Canon 250D close-up lens and it's barely adequate for that function. Canon should refund anyone who mistakenly bought one of these hockey pucks.
I was very pleased to find an 8 mega-pixel camera at such a reasonable price, ease of use and easy to use softwate for editing. 
Worthless. It rips off your battery door when you try to take the phone off. Flimsy and broke within a week. Not even worth the 0.01 I paid for it which is sad. :
With this software you can create a 2-D or 3-D game. --- Follow the tutorial you can download from www.thegamecreators.com (producers of the software) and you will create a real game in about 2 weeks of nights. --- [...] --- This box is the FULL package [...] The software is not as fully supported as the professional version, but for a hobbiest, it is perfect
This product is nice at first but you'll find yourself time and time again replacing it just so you don't have to put anymore holes in your home.  I've bought 5 of them over 4 years.  We have an expanding family and this things keeps on breaking.  DO NOT BUY, buy something better and higher quality so that you won't have to replace in 6 months.  PLEASE LISTEN TO THIS REVIEW.  IT WILL SAVE YOU
I bought this watch for the altimeter for climbing in Colorado - I recently went in January and it worked nearly perfect! Every location I could find an elevation marker, the watch was within 10 feet. The thermometer works well also, it just cannot be on your wrist to read the temp correctly. ---  --- The watch looks great, I wear it to work nearly every day. I would highly recommend it
I am vey unhappy with the sales professional in Nautica outlet stores. I had a very bad experience at Nautica store outlet stores. The customer service representatives are very rude and unprofessional. They basically said they don't really care if they lose one customer, other customers will  still buy. ( if that is the case, why are prices slashed by 50%...it is because people do not want to pay the full price ...)I do not think I will ever buy from Nautica. A few uncaring sales represtatives give a very bad name to the whole company
I love all of the bracelets that I've purchased from this vendor. They are cute and inexpensive... also, I've recieved so many compliments on this bracelet. I'm very pleased with this jewelry vendor
These noodles have a terrible, squidy texture and a wholly unpleasant smell.  They cook strangely and taste odd
Have had this less than two months and used it perhaps 3 or 4 times a week on slightly spritzed hair to tame the frizz.  The thing died!!  Did work great while it lasted....  Now trying a Conair, so keeping my fingers crossed
this magazine is sweet it features tons of eye candy, being plants and hot girls and buds, lots of great tips, tricks and info on the culture around pot
Like an apricot, but better, in my opinion. The downy fuzz, the sweet juicy flesh, there really is nothing like a good peach. I think they are best on their own, though some like to cut them up in a fruit salad or make a peach melba. That is fine, but I would strongly advise against cooking them. In my opinion, this is a waste of a good peach. A friend of mine swears by his baked peaches with demerera sugar and cinnamon, but he is a savage and a charlatan. ---  --- To conclude, peaches are without doubt one of the finest fruits around. There are few things as satisfying as a sweet ripe peach on a sunny day. --- 
Great product--just what I was looking for.  Service was excellent and shipping was prompt.  Thank you, thank you, thank you
I thought this video was disjointed and not oriented to any plot. Also the lighting was very dark and much of what was going on was unseeable
This is such a good mag! i loved all the crafts, animal pics, and other cool stuff. I learned how to feng shui your room and find out what a liger looks like. The jokes are funny too. this is one: What do you get when you cross a pig with a centipede?   Bacon and legs!. They also tell you cool facts like: Mona Lisa has no eye brows and most in england belong to the queen. So as you see this ROCKS! Buy it, buy it now. ---  --- -JAMI
We took this stroller to use for our 13 month old at Disney World & it was great!!  It held the bags we needed in the park and was very easy to get on and off busses / monorail / etc.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  It was great to have it in the airport too.  The only problem we had was that the cupholder was broken off by the airline when it was gate checked, but we can get a replacement. 
This comfort meter works very good.  The shipment came in time for a gift for Christmas.  One for us, one for gift. 
I highly reccommend this bag for anyone! It is a big tote, which is perfect for a college campus, the airport, the beach... really for any purpose. It is reversable and I was very suprised at how durable it is (great quality). When people compliment the bag it allows an opportunity to share its cause- which in the end is the most important part.
My 6-year-old got this for Christmas and he and his 4-year-old brother love it!  They enjoy doing the battles and coming up with different monster combinations.  It teaches strategy since they have to figure out which combinations work best.  My kids also like to just play with the figures by themselves like action figures.  A piece of advice though:  This game only comes with 2 figures so you really must buy additional figures or it won't be much fun since the point is to create varying combinations.  Therein lies the problem - or at least MY problem!  I can't find the extra figures for this thing!  Luckily, they were available around Christmas so I got some then, but now I can't find them in stock anywhere.  Also, I have not had any durability problems although I had some sound quality problems on the 2nd day.  Fortunately, it turned out that all I needed was new batteries. You really need alkalines for this game.  Overall, it's what my boys think though and they ADORE this!!!
Jonny's conversion is fine and I hope he is happy, but this album was not good if you are expecting the blues guitar work of his early albums.  If you want christan rock maybe this could be for you, but he missed the mark with me big time
Really worth seeing to learn about the life and talent of Budd Boetticher.  The collectors edition allows you to watch for the elements of the film that make it special
I'm sooo happy with all 3 of these scents.  The candy apple is definitely the most accurate and I'd sell my soul if I could only continue buying it on its own.  But the other 2 are good, too.  The cotton candy is awesome but not 100% on accuracy and the cherry sno-cone makes me start slobbering when I smell it.  Highly recommended
Like all cast iron cookware, not preseasoned, preseasoning is an absolute MUST. I use this product with the Bayou Classic Single Burner.It makes awsome eggs, bacon, and grilled cheese... whatever, with lots of space for cooking a bunch at once. ---  --- Great for camps, or just in the backyard for fun.
I really enjoy playing with this harp whenever I get a chance to because it produces a very good sound without having to blow or suck a lot of air in. I found it very easy to bend notes, in fact this is the first harp in which I was able to bend notes on. The roundedout edges are also very nice on the hands and it makes it easier to hold. It is made of plastic and not wood but that hasn't caused a problem so far. So I would reccomend a Hohner Golden Melody in any key to anyone. Although I would choose the one in the key of C, if you're a begginer because it would be easier to learn on I think
Since our bathroom cabinet is short on space, I loved the IDEA of this hair dryer! Unfortunately, the idea was more a fantasy than a reality. I only had this hair dryer for about a month before the cord-keeper button fell out (spring and all!) and the retractible cord stopped retracting. Since that was the only reason I bought this one over other models, I was sorely disappointed! Also, this dryer is so L-O-U-D that I had to wear earplugs (no kidding!) while drying my hair so that I wouldn't damage my hearing! Hands down the WORST hair dryer on the market
This book was "required reading" when I first started in the investment business 16 years ago -- It was a fabulous introduction to Wall Street and the stock market.  I have recommended it many times over the years, and continue to do so
I purchased this sterilizer about two weeks ago, and I have used it all of two times. It creates a horrible mess with water running everywhere when the lid is lifted, and I really had to wonder if the bottles were actually sterilized. I am terribly disappointed with this product, and truly caution those of you who are thinking of buying this to run from it like the wind
Music tunes into a part of the brain that might be connected to math skills. In any case, making music is fun, it's participatory and it teaches about rhythm, counting and doing things cooperatively. A collection of percussion instruments like blocks, and percussion accessories like sleigh bells are great to keep in a box for kids. Take them out and have the kids keep time along with a favorite cd or with a song they are singing. This is a very inexpensive toy and one that can teach a lot. It is also great for Christmas; bring the kids along to carol, and have the smallest kids keep time with the sleigh bells or make up your own percussion accompaniement.
I purchased this dvd for my very passionate son's 11th birthday.  When he opened it his eyes filled with tears.  He has loved gorillas, chimps, and all primates since he was very young.  I watched the movie before and was a little concerned about his reaction to Digit's murder.  It was as I expected, he cried in my arms.  His dream is to grow up and move to Africa to help in the survival of this extraordinary species.  The movie was given to him for encouragment from Ms. Fossey with all her beliefs and struggles.  We as the human race have a responsibility for all species on Earth.  This movie will open your eyes and make you realize how vain and selfish humans can be and it also shows that one person can make a difference and is still making a difference years after her death. ---  --- What strikes me about Mrs. Weaver is that she was also touched by Fossey's accomplishments and she is an honorary chair person for the Dian Fossey Gorilla International Fund. ---  --- Dian Fossey wrote this passage in her journal, "When you realize the value of all life, you dwell less on what is past and concentrate on the preservation of the future." ---  --- I hope this review helps you decide whether to buy the movie or not and brings at least one more person to acknowledge we must all do our part.
I love these magazines.  We subscribe to Ladybug, Spider, and Cricket (each for a different child).  The stories are great, as is the illustration.  An illustrator friend of mine says that it is very prestigious to be asked to illustrate a story in these magazines, and I figure it is the same for the stories.  No advertising, of course.  The thing I like the best is that each magazine is geared toward a certain age of child.  Highlights tries to be something for everyone, so we look through the magazine to find an appropriate story.  In Ladybug, we just start at the beginning and read straight through.  As the publisher will tell you, when your child outgrows Ladybug, you just let them know and they change your subscription to Spider (and later, Cricket.  That's as far as we've gotten)
The case is very big.  Why buy a small camera and end up with a big case.  The case looks nothing like the picture.  The picture is of another case. 
This little trike is wonderful!!!  My 2 1/2 year old loves it, as does our 5 year old neighbor.   The ride is smooth, and the low center of gravity allows for the racer instinct of most toddlers, without the high risk of tipping over.  I looked for a trike for many hours/days, and am so happy with this choice
Sound wasn't too bad for price. Tinny yes, but cheap. Used it a dozen times and then started having trouble getting it to play CDs. And then it wouldn't turn on at all.
this is absolutely my favorite magazine of all time.  if you want a magazine that caters to the lowest common denominator, readsomething else
I have loved this movie since I was a kid.  It is lightyears better than the Hornblower series that was on A&E.  I have read Forester's Hornblower series at least 10 times and never get tired of returning to them. ---  --- Gregory Peck is not quite the Hornblower that I have come to know over the years, but he does a great job.  Thank goodness this movie is out in DVD.  My VHS version is on its last legs
This is not the book to learn the basics of VBScript, but it's exactly what I needed; a good reference book. I got tired of trying to find syntax of commands and functions online. Now I have it at my fingertips
 Ed Klein is really so desperate in his attack that he can't find any one person who will use their names in the attacks against Hillary!  ---    What a lot of misinformation and outright lies. To actually accuse Marian Wright Edelman of using children for her own ends is short of criminal, and to insinuate that Chelsea was the result of a rape, even though on the next page he discusses their fertility search to become pregnant, is disgusting.  ---    I should have known what to expect when the first two words in the book were Monica Lewinsky! 
This magazine might be good if you were wealthy enough not to have to work, had time to work out four hours a day, had your own chef, could go on vacation six months out of the year, or could afford (or cared) about fashion. Otherwise don't bother. They sometimes have a decent or interesting article but they are so few and far between it is not worth it
I was all set to purchase this bag but wanted to try it out first.  I had great difficulty finding one locally but finally after many many phone calls I located one bag and asked the merchant to hold it till I could get there to try it out.  Firstly, the bag is nice but doesn't hold as much as I thought.  It still could have worked for my but for one thing: this bag is not designed for those with a, er.....womanly build.  It was the most uncomfortable bag I have ever tried out and looked absolutely ridiculous on me.  So glad I was able to take it for a test drive before purchasing online.  Just a word of warning to the ladies;-
I bought this thinking it would be great, but have been VERY disappointed.  The suction cups don't stick very well (especially on wood)even if you wet them first.  My daughter is able pull it right off the table and dump the mess on the floor
First, the Volvo wagon is supposed to be scaled for the Midge series of Barbie dolls, slightly smaller than regular Barbie. --- Another annoyance, it comes with a little pink roll-on suitcase full of microscopic Fisher-Price replica toys that have nothing to do with the Volvo.  I put all the tiny pieces together in the suitcase for my granddaughter and the suitcase wouldn't close. I looked on the box illustrations, and sure enough, they show a suitcase NOT CLOSED.  How could they design such a silly bunch of add-ons?  I just got rid of all that teeny-tiny stuff that doesn't relate to the inherent play value of the car.  Any kid would prefer to put her/his own stuff into a little suitcase than this mishmash of silly product promo from Fisher-Price.  Would have been nice to have a choice of colors, even approximately the REAL colors that the Volvo wagon comes in.  I just wanted my granddaughter to  be able to play-like with Grandma's white Volvo wagon.  How hard should that be?  Overall, I'm disappointed with this toy. For 28$, shipping included, I expected a better toy.  Not worth the money
I was looking for a beginner microscope for my 7 year old.  This was probably more than she needed for her age, but with adult supervision, it should last well into her later elementary years.  The package came secure and on time.  It was exactly what I expected.  It is a solid product and I prefer the plug in option that this product offers versus other products that require batteries.  The highest power (400x) is difficult view with some slides but I believe it has to do with practice.  We have been successful viewing certain slides with the highest power setting with some patience.  It is absolutely fascinating.
The printer is fast and printing is always properly aligned on the paper. Quality of printed text is as good as any decent desktop printer and that is why I bought it in the first place. I am yet to try printing photos. Because this is a mobile printer the manufacturer needs to ensure that the unit will stand up to the hits and accidents caused by regular transporting. It might mean providing a second skin or a padded bag with the uni
These strawberries are great.  They are great on cereal.  The price is fantastic.  My kids had some freeze dried berries at a "space center" but they were much more expensive.  These are a steal.  I am so happy to know where to get great freeze dried berries at a great price. 
my son is absolutely loves this dvd/games.  I have to turn off the main switch to the computer in order to keep him off of it and play with his sister. he learned so much since I got this learning system and I am totally extati
I like this product very much. It is very soft, unlike the other tubs where I was scared that my son would hit his head. The only drawback I have about is the belt....maybe in the next one they can come up with a good belt that would hold the infant. Other than that I  would recommend it to anyone. It looks very comfortable too. Especially if you have taller babies this is the best bathing system
This book was recommended to me by several people as I interviewed hiring managers, HR personnel, senior-level employees, and others for my own book on the job market.  By all accounts, my own included, 201 Best Questions is comprehensive, helpful, and tactical, an important read when one is preparing for an interview.  It is not an all-inclusive resource, only interview-targeted, but for what it is, the book is top-notch
I've owned a Tracfone for 3 years.  My old Tracfone quit working, so I purchased a new one.  I've been trying for 4 weeks to transfer my old phone number to my new Tracfone.  It's been a nightmare-after 4 weeks, 3 new sim cards, and countless calls to TracFone customer service reps, I've accomplished nothing.  My phone is still not activated, I still don't have my old number transfered, and I've wasted 7 hours speaking to customer reps.  I don't recommend TracFone
This book is beautifully constructed, concise, gracefully written, and should be of immense help to most golfers.  If you've read Ernest Jones, Percy Boomer, or Jimmy Ballard (for example) and enjoyed the insights but found it difficult to transfer the written word to your swing, try "The Keys ...": You will read a book that may finally lead you to improve your game.  My swing improved markedly after I came to understand author McTeigue's "lighthouse turn" (Lesson Two: Momentum).  
Let me count the ways. ---  --- They're great for a quick energizing snack/ breakfast/ healthy dessert, and tonight I even had one for dinner.  They are delicious and you feel good about eating them because they're good for you! ---  --- Plus you get a lot of bang for a deceptively tiny ball... they're very filling and only about 200 calories. ---  ---  --- GENIUS
She really brings a character to life.  And this short series of British comedy was really enjoyable
This gate only worked for 8 months and the latch broke!  The company would not replace it because they only offer a 90 day warranty.  They will not even let you buy a replacement part.  They want you to buy a entire new gate.  What a rip off!  Don't buy this gate, it is a piece of trash
My son really likes the way the picks make his guitar sing
I really enjoyed this book. I found it in a bookstore one day and read it for pleasure slowly. I am a theory student (now) so I wanted to see a lot more math, but aside from that shortcoming (which some might welcome) it was just a fantastic description of fluid motion and derivations of the governing equations on a simple level.
Overall I don't like it. When the screen is black between scenes and what not, their is a lot of mixed in red and other colors from interference. Buy a different one, this one is just not up to the task
I got it just today and used it for cleaning my lens. The solution might be useful, the blower is useful, the swabs can be useful with their pointed tips, but the so called "magic cloth" is anything but magic. It kept leaving lint on my lens
This robe virtually fell apart when I washed it.  It stained the inside of my washing machine.  It raveled before I even got a chance to wear it.  Do not buy this product.  I got the burgandy one.  I am so disappointed by this product I may stop shopping at Amazon
I bought this because I wanted a primer for make up, but have acne prone skin and felt that most other primers would make me break out, as some reviews have stated. Initially I did break out a little, but I kept using it becuase the rest of my skin looked so great and felt so smooth. After a week the breakouts went away (they were minor) and all I can say is WOW. My skin looks so much better, my make up looks better, I look better without make up, etc. etc. I use it with Complete Me powder foundation and I have never in all my 38 years been happier with a pair of products.
2 Fast 2 Furious is one of those sequels that comes around every so often that doesn't require you to have seen the original. I saw this movie for the first time not too long after it came out, and having never seen the original, I thought I would be lost and wouldn't enjoy myself as much as other people, but on the contrary - I left the experience much happier than when I came in. ---  --- This film is full of quick one-liners that deserve a laugh. The special effects and the car races will leave your mouth gaping open. I have heard and read that people didn't appreciate this film as much because it seemed to focus more on a plot than the first film did rather than focus more on the races, but overall, I think the balance works well. Even thinking of the plot that we are left with, I really can't see another time when a race would even be appropriate. ---  --- And as for people saying that this film is worse than the original, I would have to disagree...Why? Frankly, I have always been a firm believer than Vin Diesel is entirely overrated as an actor. (I mean, c'mon - Have you seen the Pacifier?) He's nothing more than a meat head who, while able to do pretty good fight scenes, should leave the dialogue to someone else.  ---  --- Yes, this film is for the younger crowd, and there are numerous occasions when unbelievable events take place (take the boat jumping as an example), but there is no saying that an older person wouldn't enjoy it as well...The only thing that I will say is that you really shouldn't go into this film expecting an Oscar worthy performance, or else you will be disappointed. If you sit back and take this as the fun romp that it is, however, you will thoroughly enjoy yourself
I bought these just a couple of months ago but i've already put them to the test. I went hiking to a waterfall in Mexico, I ended up covered in mud, my new shoes included. I was worried they would be spoiled (it really was a lot of mud). Then I just washed them with running water and all the dirt was gone. Besides being really comfortable, it's great to know that you can use them in all types of terrain and they will do the job.
Excellent value for money. Our 8-month old enthusiastically used this seat as a travelling feeding chair as well as a floor chair and we wouldn't have managed the holidays without it!  This seat is strong and stable, yet easily assembled/dis-assembled.  It folded flat to fit in our suitcase and has become a valuable travel companion with our young family.  We purchased this on 19 Dec and it was delivered prior to Christmas - well done Amazon
do not buy this system.  for the money there are much better systems out there.   ---  --- I bought this for my family room mainy for the small size of the cube speakers.  The main problem with the system (which bose has corrected by the way) is that the "acoustimass" component (bose's fancy name for a subwoofer) is not active (or powered) which means the base is totally inadequate and is overun by the cubes which have no mid or bass ranges.  The result is that you get a very "tinny" sound out of most applications including dvd's.  I ended up getting a sony active subwoofer and it sounds much better.   ---  --- In hindsight I would have bought a different brand than bose, but already had to much invested in bose to scrap the system completely, and the size of the cubes is nice.  Still pissed that I spent that much money on a substandard system, but hey, got sucked into the bose marketing machine
This movie is very simple, and unique. It's the kind of love story which you really believe in while you're watching because it doesn't feel phony. This can be credited to the acting, the situation, and the plot as well. This isn't about a man falling madly in love with a beautiful woman and then spending his life missing her. That's all been done, and that's what makes this film a breath of fresh air. River Phoenix shows why he is missed by so many, and really allows you to connect with his character. I recomend this to anyone who wants to see love put to true art, and be touched at the same time
This is the same as A. T. Cross black ink for fountain pens. This ink is popular with fountain pen enthusiasts. It feels good during writing. It dries to a nice, dark, opaque black color. It is not very water resistant. It is not safe for writing checks
I thought I was upgrading from analog to digital but after seeing the videos I shot indoors I liked the analog better. Very poor and grainy.  Also the focus is terrible! While filming 3 people in a row moving from one to the other the focus would blur then refocus.  I filmed my daughter's ballet recital and could not believe how the auto focus kept bluring then focusing.  Very disappointed with this purchase.  I guess it's true what they say. "You get what you pay for"  It seems under $600.00 doesn't get you much
 I tried. I really tried, but I was simply incapable of getting into this program. The lead character in Nighty Night is so thoroughly, contemptably self-centered and unlikable she makes Larry David in Curb Your Enthusiasm seem like a big cuddly teddy bear. This is a person who has not had an unselfish thought for another human being in her entire life. She's also insane. Completely. And not in a cute or funny way. She dosen't live in this world. She lives in one where the entire universe revolves around her, making it entirely acceptable for her to say or do anything no matter how ludicrous, dishonest or rude. She literaly has no idea she's a monster. I can see how that could be funny but not with this show's incredibly dry, lifeless presentation. I never thought I'd say this but Nighty Night could actually use a laugh track to let us know when the producers think we're supposed to laugh. And I hate laugh tracks.
I just finished seeing the movie and loved the song at the end and immediately started looking up amazon for this song.  Thanks to Melania for pointing out the song title at the end. I realize this CD is just a soundtrack, but typically most soundtracks also include the ending songs. It is just plain dumb not to include the best music in this CD.   ---  --- MY VOTE - DO NOT BUY THIS CD. The soundtrack is all pretty generic stuff.  BUT GET THE ENDING TITLE SONG IF YOU CAN - It's great.  ---  --- 
This item is REALLY small. I didn't read the other reviews and missed the info on the actual size of the item. In hindsight, I wouldn't have order it had I paid more attention. I think the other products from Haba (eggs and teabags) are worth the money for the size.
the product seems like a great idea, however, it did not come with attatchments for an i-pod, which is the reason we bought it.  Called the company to get the adapter and now need the mfg part number.  it has just been a hassle
I bought three of these for friends for Christmas and I have to say that I LOVED them.  And most of all THEY LOVED THEM.  They are gorgeous!  Just enough sparkle without being too much.  I highly recommend this if you are looking for something classy and slightly understated
This movie is laughable today. It's very dated, and it shows. It's not worth your time. The acting is so-so, but felt forced (like William Shatner style). The storyline is okay. By today's standards, it appears like a low budget flick
Like the other reviewer, I have this clock in my office - in my case in the middle of a warehouse. ---  --- Within 2 minutes the atomic clock had connected and set the time and date.  It has been in wireless contact ever since (there is an icon to let you know) ---  --- The time numerals are a little over 2" high and very clear - easy to read from 50' away.  The day, date and temp displays are about an inch tall and also very clear, but since they are so much smaller they don't have quite the distance visability. ---  --- It is nice to have a clock around that is always right - keeps my meetings on time - no arguement over whose watch is correct
This stuff is the worst smelling conditioner I ever encountered.  The perfume penetrated my hair and has not been able to get removed.  It took 2 days before the scent calmed down enough that it was not bothering me with its obnoxiousness.  I wish I could give it a negative rating.  I am glad all I used was a sample and did not pay money to make my hair stink
The gun broke about 7 days after my son received it and the people WOULD NOT take it back - said he'd had it too long.  I will never buy this product, nor work with this seller again.  HORRIBLE.
The skin fits well & the belt clip works well. It seems a bit bulkier than my friend's Zen skin & belt clip...but she paid about $10 more than I did! I would definitely recommend this product. I have yet to use the armband so I can't review that right now.  ---  --- My only issue is the screen protector fits into the window of the skin, not Zen screen. So the screen protector is smaller than the Zen screen. The window of the skin covers a couple millimeters of the top of the screen, but that part only tells the time anyway
I have read several of Hiaasen's books and loved them.  They were very funny.  This one is not.  It is an endless description of naked strippers.  I found the main character, Erin, to be very unappealing.  She is just so stupid.  Her problems are all of her own creation.  And she is not funny.  I think you have to be a man to like this book.  I, as a woman, just found it exceedingly boring.  I kept waiting for it to get funny.  It never did
Man oh man...I love documentaries and character studies. ---  --- Crumb, Capturing the Friedmans, The Thin Blue Line etc... ---  --- But THIS...my god, the mind boggles at the level of pretentiousness of the folks who claim to "love" or "get" this horrible mess. ---  Over an hour and a half of two crazy women who are essentially shut-ins rambling on about nothing at all in what looks like an abandoned shack surrounded by vermin and garbage a foot deep. ---  The two women in question are "Big Edie" and "Little Edie", the aunt and cousin of Jackie O respectively. ---  ---  Let me sum up the whole 100 minutes for you; ---  --- Little Edie: I hate it here. I had to leave New York to come here and take care of my mother. --- Big Edie: I was fine. I used to have a lovely singing voice. --- Little Edie: But I missed out on my big chance to make it. --- Big Edie: Oh well. You missed out. --- Little Edie: I miss New York. I hate it here. --- Big Edie: Did you feed the cats? --- Little Edie; YES!!! I fed them!!! --- Big Edie: I used to have a lovely singing voice. ---  ---  Now imagine this being repeated over and over again for 100 minutes. ---  ---  Do yourself a favor; Before you let anyone talk you into seeing this piece of dreck just go sit on skid row for 2 hours and listen to the rambling of the hobos and mental patients. ---  You'll save the money and get some fresh air at the same time. ---   --- Horrible. --- Just plain horrible
This straightener has been one of the worst I have ever used. It didn't straighten at all. I had to go over sections of my hair more than 10 times to get it at least semi straight. It did not stay straight either.<br /> --- WASTE OF MONEY!!! DON'T BUY
The darn thing broke almost immediately. ---  --- When I tried to switch gel covers (it comes with 3 different sizes) the entire earpiece came off in my hands! ---  --- What a flimsy piece of crap. ---  --- I just sent it back to Amazon. I'm never buying a Jabra product again
Very very loud-enough to make you're ears ring (thats a good sign) ---  --- Bass is very deep and the silver volume dots on one of the speakers are touch sensitive like the ipod-now thats cool. ---  --- Great great desktop speakers, and they can hook up right to your ipod. Worth the money
This is a perfect office suite for those who don't need all the new stuff that is available in office 2007. Outlook appears to be working great without some of the hang-ups in earlier additions. Probably more stuff in here than most people need, but it is easy to use and has some great enhancements
I was very disappointed in this dryer and am returning it.  It is very heavy and I am not a weakling!  It is also very big.  With my arm stretched out all the way I can barely get it to my head.  Because it is so heavy and big I have 'banged' myself on the head with the 'fingers'.  Just things to consider when deciding whether to buy this dryer. --- 
When this adapter first arrived, I thought it was great. The sound quality was excellent, and free of all the distortion and interference I get from using an FM transmitter-style adapter (there are few open frequencies in the SF Bay Area). The first day, I used it for about 20 minutes total (didn't have far to drive), and it worked great. The second day I had a bit farther to drive. After about 30 minutes, it quit. Hasn't worked again since. ---  --- I didn't expect it to last forever, but less than an hour? ---  --- Yes, it has a 1 year warranty: just send the unit back with a money order ($6) to cover the return postage. Of course, then you're spending more in postage than you originally spent for the unit..
We bought this bicycle for our son's 3rd birthday.  He LOVED the bright colors and the fact that it has somewhere for his horses to ride!  It has taken a little while for him to get used to the training wheels, but the bike stays steady while he is riding and doesn't threaten to tip.  We are very happy with this bicycle
I really had no faith before this book.  Not really sure what I should of beleived.  But this book def changed my point of view and it is shocking! Eveything just seemed ot come together and to me it just makes complete sense and I feel that this book is entirely true.   It would be great to see the world come together in world peace if they only knew the truth.  I knew the government covered stuff up but I had no idea to the extent they would goto to keep their undreground society such a secret and ruthless and would stop at nothing.  He doesn't say it straight out but the way it is described protrays this secret rogue group to be the illumnati with unlimited funding to carry out their evil intentions.  Greatest book I ever rea
This pedometer is easy to set up and use.  I tested its accuracy at the local highschool track by walking a 1/2 mile, and sure enough, my pedometer read 1/2 mile. The clip is sturdy, I haven't had any problem with the device falling off.  The leash is a good extra - if it did fall off, it wouldn't hit the ground.  My doctor gave me a goal of 10,000 steps per day, so I wear this all day long.  It is light and I don't notice I am wearing it throughout the day. ---  --- The only downfall to this device (as is probably true with others)is that your stride is measured for walking, so when you are running or doing other cardio activity (elliptical) it doesn't accurately measure your distance.  Since your stride is longer during a cardio activity (running), and the device is measuring your walking stride, the distance measurement falls short.  However, the actual number of steps taken is still accurately measured.  I suppose you could adjust the setting to a running stride when running to bridge this gap
Even though yugioh is dead, this is my favorite pack (even though i don;t get them any more). The deck that i made is an Archfiend deck, which can kill you if you don't have a spell card on the field that says you don't have to pay life points for Archfiend cards. They are also one of the strongest group if cards. There is TerrorKing Archfiend, InfernalQueen Archfiend, Archfiend Solder, and others. Even though yugioh is dead, some people still play ot, and some stores but them from you. I sold my deck for $$$, you should too.  
Like so many other small home office users, I have recently upgraded my network to 1000mpbs to help increase productivity.  Unfortunately, I originally purchased a GigE 8 port switch from another mfg. that used a fan on their switch, a VERY noisy fan.  After a month of listening to what sounded like an airplane engine, I tossed that unit and purchased this 8port Netgear GigE unit.  It is SILENT.  Basically a plug and play item due to its unmanaged nature, I have had good data thru put and no problem.  It comes with a small clip on stand for vertical storage if desired.  The unit is finished in an attractive gray and chrome exterior.  It is also small enough to live on a desktop with sucking up valuable real estate. ---  --- So, if you are looking for a switch that will not be stored remotely in some closet, this is the one that will keep the peace in your office. A+ ****
Grado has a world wide reputation for the best sound reproduction in their cans (audiophile speak for headphones) and they have the awards to back them up!  Too often though, I've read reviews where comfort is criticized and that these ear cushions are allegedly to blame.  Nonsense! ---  --- It is true that Grado cans are supraural (on the ear) as opposed to circumaural (around the ear) so you will feel the unit against your ears.  These cushions were redesigned back in 1998, offering greater thickness and distance from the transducer so that you feel more comfortable while listening through your cans AND the design allows for a greater soundstage for the magnificent Grado cans to impress you with.  These cushions, called "L-Cush" here, can be used on every single pair of current Grado cans except perhaps the $1000 set.  I use them on my SR60's, which come with a standard foam cushion that covers the whole transducer and it made them sound quite nearly as good as the SR80's!  I recommend them to you wholeheartedly!  If you google "The Listening Station," that is the place to purchase any Grado product from
This program is average to below average in it's abilities. ---  --- That said, just hope you don't need any Roxio tech support. --- Why? because Roxio's  support bites! ---  --- You CANNOT contact anyone online or by email for help; --- whenever their dis-functional "web portal" [web-based support] system traps you in an endless loop.  ---  --- I needed an couple simples updates for a pc that is NOT ALLOWED on the internet. ---  --- It used to be you could download Roxio's PATCHES from any pc having internet access.  --- Then burn patch[s] to a CD, or copy to floppy/jumpdrive. --- Then "sneakernet" the patches to the pc needing them. ---  --- NO MORE. ---  --- What happened today was that their webpage was apparently trying to download/patch a roxio product directly on MY pc. --- [EZCD5 doesn't exist on my pc]. ---  --- Instead of simply letting me download it somewhere, like to my hard drive, vs patchging it directly from their webpage to my pc, --- [which won't work in my case as I'm not using roxio, nor have it installed on my pc]; ---  apparently the morons that did the roxio webpage coding make the download/patch process STOP/END and proceed to send the customer back to Roxio's initial patch download page. ---  --- When you need a patch, all these endless loops and support games --- are enough to get me looking for a different product/different company. ---  --- If you want to minimize human contact with customers, fine. --- But let folks at least download the patches they need in order to keep their pc going. --- Don't hand over your customer support system [almost] completely to a WEB SERVER.  --- That ignorant arrangement works about as well as when companies try to save a few pennies and get rid of phone receptionists for customer service telephone calls. --- Then they let customers wade through a 100 layer deep voicemail system to find the answer to a simple problem. ---  --- IT JUST DOESN'T WORK. ---  --- If a company won't provide access to PATCHES,  --- even after I have logged into their website with username and password, [so they know is accessing their patches]  --- AND they  don't offer any type of  --- FTP site  as a download backup  option, then  --- I sure as heck won't be buying anymore of their products. ---  --- I see why Roxio bought up CeQuadrat and other companies. --- [Though I hate to see such quality companies be devoured like that].  --- When a competitor has a better product, why fight to improve your prodsuct's quality/features, when you can buy the other company out. ---   --- Thank goodness Nero is not under the Roxio umbrella. --- 
This drive has a great aesthetic design, but did not work out of the box when I received it. Amazon delivered promptly as usual, but quality of this product is definitely lacking. Look at the Western Digital... that's what I now have and have had no issues.
The slowed down almost spoken version of Downpressor Man nearly makes it worth the purchase price alone.  Sure I've got most of the tracks on other Tosh collections, but these recordings are excellent variants
I have not actually taken this underwater yet, but it appears to be well made and of similar quality to other cases. It keeps the --- over-all size of the camera/case down to a size that could fit into a BC pocket. On the downside, it does have only limited functionality of the camera through the available buttons. You can zoom and telephoto, change from camera,playback and to movie mode and shoot the picture. You cannot do any of the setup functions while it is in the case. Regarding a stobe, Sony makes one that looks a little cheezy. There is a "universal" strobe by Sea Life (SL 960D) that fits, but the fiber-optic trigger is just taped onto the flash of the camera. I'm waiting to how this works. One replacement O-ring comes with the case-replacements from sony were outrageously expensive. Color-correcting (red) lenses are about $100 from sony, but not needed if you use a strobe. (unless maybe to shoot movies?)
Portable, easy to use with any chip and really nice pix. I love being able to print from digital files on my ipod
The adage holds steady with this magazine.  What, to the hip consumer, appears to be a hopeful window into the world of cool turns out to be completely empty.  It would be insulting how hard they try to represent the scene of New York, if it weren't so embarrassing.  Get the village voice.  Try the other coast with Interview.  Just stay away from this disgusting fluff
The DAVA technology is my favored type in all situations. The combination of a flexible center and a rigid playing surface is wonderful. In addition, the pick surface is textured to enable a better grip with wet or dry fingers. DAVA is the only brand of picks I use and each type suits my every need. I whole heartedly recommend them to anyone.
Watching this movie is a very bizarre experience.  Having attended high school in the countryside, close to large clusters of Amish farms, I had heard stories from my friends at school about rumspringing Amish teenagers.  I dismissed most of them as rumor.  This movie confirmed that those wild stories I heard were probably true.  A very intruiging look at the flipside of a lifestyle most Americans cannot even begin to comprehend.  Worth a rental at the very least
All of the above reviews are correct.  They are nice looking and moderately functional.  I may pour some concrete to overcome some of the functional problems it has.  The stake needs to go deeper into the ground to keep it from coming out.  At $10.99 however, it was a great bargain, and a 4 star rating.  At it's current winter sale price of $16.99 however, it is a 1 star rating.  I'll average them weighting it's current price and give it 2 stars. 
If you like strong coffess, go with this, its wonderful! Definitely worth it
Rogers and Hammerstein's "Cinderella" is one of my favorite musicals ever! But does this rendition do it justice? Absolutely not!!!!! More glitz and fancier costumes do not a make a better musical by any means. Maybe if I was not enamored with Leslie Ann Warren or Julie Andrews who make far better Cinderellas I would have enjoyed this. I am not against a politically correct image like this story attempts but if it was done tastefully i would have appreciated it better. If you are a Rogers and Hammerstein fan like I am, you want to watch it anyway but its not merely as charming as the other ones. Its ALOT more exciting that the Julie Andrews version was recently found save your money and buy that one. However a younger audience or an audience that was not enamored with the other Rogers and Hammerstein Cinderellas will appreciate it far better
low tech and brilliant, music that seems to have channeled Zappa, Winchester Cathedral, and god knows what else.  incredibly funny, and then suddenly sad.  mr pink is a genius, you betcha.  and he explains what it is and how it is to live here in this strange quasi-city in the shadow of the industry, in the curiously full and fun wasteland of other people's dreams
My daughter just received this as a Christmas gift.  She was so excited.  My husband and mother-in-law went to the tv to install it.  15 minutes later my five year old is in tears.  I wish this had been reviewed before we purchased.  The graphics are terrible.  This will be going back to the store.  Glad I still have the receipt.
I was excited to plan out an interior design project with this tool, but ended up disappointed.  They definately oversell it as an interior design tool.  Looking at the brochure online, I really think they must have touched up the images, because I don't see any way that they could have created them with this product.  As a matter of fact, the website Punch Interior Design software package implies that they did just that. ---  --- The reason I don't give it 1 star is that the video tutorial section is really great.  I wish all software had that.  
The watch is very colorful. It is even safe to wear in the shower. However the watch cannot be read in the dark and the hands are even hard to see in daylight. It takes an extra few seconds to figure out wear the hands are. But adults who can't get enough of Harry should consider this watch
Better balance of songs on this Cd. This Cd shows growth in a the band.They are great fun live check them out if you get the chance!!!!!!!
I think I just don't like pilates because I really didn't care for this workout. Plus, you are constantly roling up and down and from years as a ballet dancer we have always been taught that rolling your spine when working the stomach will not flatten the stomach it will cause the muscle to bulk up in your stomach and you'll have a round hard belly. This is not my idea of an attractive waist line and this is true because it happened to a girl in one of my classes. So, that's the main reason I just didn't like this video
I'm more than satisfied with this scale.  I was concerned that I would have to buy a more expensive scale to get good accuracy (see reviews of other digital scales in this price range,) but I've tested it several times over several days, and my weight varies by 2 pounds or less over the course of the day.  My first weigh-in of the day is pretty much the same as previous mornings, sadly. ---  --- The neutral color (grey) and glass would blend in well with just about any decor, and the LCD screen is easy to read, with 1.5 inch high numbers. ---  --- The only thing I don't like about it is that it creaks quite a lot when I step on it, even though I'm nowhere near its 330 pound maximum load.  That problem is in my head more than in the scale: I don't think it's going to break, but it sounds like I've got two people standing on it at once--I'm not THAT fat, am I? ---  --- An added feature is that when I'm craving, I go into the bathroom and look at it, and know that it isn't going to fall for any of my excuses tomorrow morning.  So the last piece of cake still sits in the fridge.  The scale has intimidated me into not eating it. ---  --- Accurate, easy to read, easy on the eyes, and intimidating--I think it's a good deal
This sheet is great solution for difficult to change crib sheets- just lay it over the top of your pretty sheet and snap it to the crib frame.  I highly recommend it to those who don't like wrestling the crib sheet onto the mattress
These slippers are not a bargain. They fall apart within a few months and then you need to buy another pair again. Don't buy 'em. They're junk
I have been using the Fuji E550 for almnost two years, with none of the problems that have been reported by some of the reviewers.  ---  --- Here are the negatives:  ---  --- 1) The flash has mediocre range and is a little finicky. If you don't depress the shooting button all the way, it may not flash.  ---  --- 2) In bright light, the screen on the back is unusable - it washes out the image. BUT the camera has a fine viewfinder so this is not really a major issue. ---  --- The positives: ---  --- 1) It takes great pictures. Really excellent. ---  --- 2) It's small, and easy to carry. ---  --- 3) The controls are well thought out and positioned on the camera body. Very easy to use.  ---  --- 4) It has several automatic modes - sports, landscapes, portrait, etc, or you can use it on manual. I always use one of the programmed modes.  ---  --- 5) The video option is not bad at all - my twelve year old (now 13) uses it. ---  --- I was so pleased with this camera I bought one for my administrative assistant about ten months ago, and she is very happy with it. ---  --- At it's current price I think this camera is a bargain. Only reason I didn't give it five stars is because of the weak flash. ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  --- 
GREAT PRODUCT, DURABLE AND QUALITY STITCHING. WORTH ITS PRICE TO PROTECT YOUR GRILL
This item is cheap and I don't mean the price.  It will not stay together.  The plastic frames do not attach well to the mat because it is held with velcro that keeps coming undone.  The arched bars are not bent enough causing one side to pop up off the floor.  I tried bending them myself, but they always return to their original shape.  Pay the extra money and get a better mat
I have owned this for about a week and wanted to share some initial thoughts.  All in all pretty pleased with the purchase.  It was well packaged and worked flawlessly with my iPod Mini.  There are five additional templates that can be used to dock different models.  Panicked at first because they didn't have one for the Mini, but it was already installed on the model.  Cons: ---  --- - Light dimmer has three settings, but even the lowest is too bright.  You can turn it off and it can be controlled by the remote. --- - No ability to set a permanent alarm by day of week.  For example 7:00AM Monday to Friday, no alarm on Weekends. --- - Wake to music starts and accelerates to the preset (by you) volume in something like 7 seconds so it is definitely not gentle. --- - Sound is great for an alarm clock.  Don't think it will compare with a mini stereo or Bose SoundDock.   ---  --- Would buy again at the price
This game reminds me alot of the Grand Theft Auto series.  While it has many similar characteristics in the way you get around town, go into buildings, and the way you interact with the environment it still manages to offer a few original and interesting components to the gaming industry. This game has a great storyline that fans will likely enjoy.  Even if you weren't a fan of the movie this game is still a must.  Like GTA there are a few side missions (not as massive as GTA though), there are collectibles, and then you have main missions along the way.  While the object of the game is to take over New York, some of the warehouses and businesses can get repetitive, but its mostly all fun.  One plus is the police in this game tend to be less of a hassle unlike the GTA games.  This lets you keep playing rather than having to stop and restart at a safehouse or in the police station.  This helps speed up the game. The controlls take time to get used to but after you play for a little while you are good to go.  If you like the GTA format style of play you will certainly like this.  Also if you like the Godfather, the storyline to the game is great and really stays true to the movie. While its not the best game of the year it will certainly do until a new GTA comes out.  It took me about 2 weeks to finish the game playing a few hourse each night.  I hope they can come up with Godfather 2.  We will see...  
This product is exactly as described and arrived very quickly... A+++++ seller!  Will definately buy from again
My subscription was for a year. But the subscription office stopped sending the magazines even before the subscription expired. I would suggest people subscribe to Good Housekeeping directly instead
No other game looks or plays like this; The missions and locations are varied and colorful; The villians range from a fat guy with dynamite strapped to his person to corrupt law officials; And, as usual, Rockstar keeps the game play challenging but not overly frustrating; Lots of unlockables offer high replay. This is one of the most unique and best looking games on any system, period. I still throw this one in every 6 months for another go thru. The story is straightforward and engaging; Lots of really interesting concepts(machinegun in the coffin, crazy midgets, that whole 'dead-eye' thing...)and it controls very well. Another great game from an outstanding company. Hopefully a sequel is in the works.   
I had wished that I had bought this potty chair from the very begining.  I bought my son the royal potty throne from fisher price it ended up leaking.  I never could find the place that is was leaking.  So I purchased Babybjorn Green potty chair.  My son loved it the moment that I took it out of the box.  He wanted to use it in the family room.  I love it because it is only 2 pieces.  It's so super easy to clean. And it is green my sons favorite color.  Great price and great size.  I recommend this item
yesterday we where buying the christmass presents, when i saw there was the big air towel at 40 bucks, so i said to my mother if i could buy so she said yes, when i got home i began building it, after 6 hours i finished it. ---  --- And when i tried everything was going all right, so it wasn't that difficult  --- 
it was easy to order and very affordable and they were here quickly...I want to get more...thank
I purchased this CD during the lowest time of my life emotionally. Every track brought solace and comfort beyond belief, especially the title track, Deep Peace. I would listen to it over and over, bathing in the lush healing sounds. Each element, from the perfectly balanced vocals to the simple piano and violin motifs, is seemingly structured at a spiritual level. This is more than ambient music, it's true music therapy. --- 
This is a very good camera for the price range. I have always had good luck with Sony products, unlike some of the reviewers here. The resolution of the viewer window and the image quality itself is more than what I would expect from a camera in this price range.... it's pretty decent. For what most people use DV cams for, this is camera doesn't suck at all. --- I like how tiny it is. It doesn't go much past the palm of my hand when I'm holding it. Also it was very easy to figure out just by exploring the menu on the touch pad. Color graphics & icons on the menus add a nice touch. A beginner could start filming very soon after opening the box, I think. The camera feels sturdy in my hand, I mean I don't feel like the viewer window is going to break off when it's open or that I could easily break the buttons with normal use.  ---  --- As others have mentioned, you have to buy a 4 to 6 firewire if you have a mac because the iLink cable that comes with it is a S-video input for TVs. Also the battery that comes with it is the 30 minute battery but I would have bought an extra one anyway because you never want to wait around while your only battery is charging. The software CD is a do-it-yourself install, at least for Mac. It might not be for PC. I'm used to being guided through the installation process... (since at least the early 90's!) but I had to drag the folder to my hard drive my darn self.  A minor thing but I would have expected more from a major company like Sony. --- But the reason I give it a 4 star rating instead of 5 is because the firewire goes into the base, not the camera so you cannot have the camera on a tripod while it's connected to your machine. I realize this will not be a big problem for very many people but since I do stop-motion animation and use frame grabbing software, I need to have it connected to firewire and on a tripod in while I'm working. I almost returned the camera when I discovered this but instead I hot glued velcro to the bottom of the base and to my tripod adaptor so I could have the firewire plugged in and attached to the tripod....kinda ghetto. I figure it was worth it though since I got such a good camera for the price (I paid $299 on sale for it.) --- If you're looking for a decent but cheap camera I would recommend either this one or the hc42 if you want to shoot in widescreen.
   I'm a fan of Audrey Hepburn and this movie relys heavily - too heavily on her charm.  And unfortunately, it is some of her worst acting work, posey, sing-song, and superficial.  Now, if you've read her bio, and know what was going on with her and Holden, that could explain it, but still, this film is very static. ---    Like most Heburn films, a highlight is her clothes, her style, her self.  This film self-consciously relys on this when the script itself could simply have been better.  There are some very fun cameos by big performers that raise moments here.  This film would have benefited greatly by a better comic actress in the lead.  Jayne Mansfield could have been a hoot in this, Thelma Ritter too, in a very different way, somebody with less style and more off beat snap, crackle, and pop.  (Thelma Ritter and William Holden paired in a romantic comedy... I'm all ready laughing!) ---    Before I hit this too harshly, this film was intended to be a trifle, the kind of movie that has bright colors and light plot for a hot summer day that sizzles.  For that, it is adequate. ---    The remake, ALEX AND EMMA suffers very much from the same problems.  They actually improved the script, and gave the leading lady room to make some very wacky choices, but both films seem to have suffered from "settling for a star" when a less mainstream, more zany actress was needed.  OK, this doesn't stink...it has Audrey, but it certainly doesn't sizzle
Note: 4 1/2 stars is what I mean. ---  ---      This is one of the most gorgeous films you will ever see.  You can watch this film without sound or subtitles and still be enraptured. The breathtaking landscapes, the gorgeous use of colors, the wonderful costume design, the stunning dance and fight choreography will captivate you like few films do.   ---      The musical score is excellent, it enhances the mood of the scenes even further. The acting is also very convincing, your hearts will go out to these characters.   ---      The story is simple, but has some interesting twists, and is told very well. Compared to most movies there is very little dialogue, but you won't miss it.  Words are never wasted, every line seems essential.  My only qualm is with the final unfolding of events which are not bad, but were not up to the level of the rest of the film. ---      Target audience: Anyone who doesn't mind subtitles. 
Based on the reviews for this CD I decided to buy it without having sampled it. Big mistake. I love, among others, Marshall Crenshaw, Don Dixon and Peter Holsapple, but what happened here? This was so not fabulous
A GREAT PRODUCT FOR DRY SKIN, WITHOUT LEAVING A GREASY FEELING.  NOT ONLY DOES IT MAKE MY SKIN FEEL SOFT BUT IT SMELLS WONDERFUL.
The craftsmanship on this watch it absolutely top rate.  Very nice band, not flimsy or cheap. The world time is very cool
This is a nicly styled jersey that could use a fabric or fabric finish makeover. The plain polyester is rough to the skin requiring the use of an undershirt to prevent chafing. The collar is cut high enough to cut across the base of the neck leaving a nasty burn mark. ---  --- A cotton, cotton blend, or silk would have made a better choice of fabric making this an unbeatable jersey for many uses
Great movie! Pretty funny, and it has a  wonderful moral to it, but I won't give it away! Watch the movie! You'll love it
TOO BAD THERE WASN'T A RATING OF 0 STAR. THIS IS THE WORST PIECE OF JUNK I EVER BOUGHT. FIRST OF ALL WE WERE LOOKING FOR A BRAND CALLED SPORTS AFIELD. THIS ITEM FELL UNDER IT WHEN WE DID A SEARCH. WHEN IT ARRIVED IT WAS SOME OFF THE WALL BRAND.THEY WERE PAPER THIN BUT  THOUGHT MAYBE THEY WERE WARM BEING IT WAS FROM AN ARMY AND NAVY STORE. WRONG!!!!!!! THEY SERVED NO PURPOSE AT ALL.WERE NOT WARM AT ALL. .WE WASHED THEM PER DIRECTIOS ON TAG AND SHRUNK SO BAD I DON'T THINK A 2 YR OLD COULD FIT IN THEM.DO NOT BUY!!!!!!JUN
Ok! Being the richest human being on the planet called earth, Bill Gates decided that he's not wealthy enough. So he released this Microsoft office 2003, which I really think is not much different from previous edition. The price is, as usual, very expensive. What's worse is that Bill Gates decided all the pre-installed windows in new laptops and desktops come with the trial version. So mere mortals like us need to spend extra BIG money buying the full version to simply do some basic documents. --- I can see Bill Gates, being a deified bloodsucker, using $100 dollar bills as toilet paper, and laughing at us who work their butt off just to make enough money to live. SO SHAME ON YOU BILL GATES AND MICROSOFT
my son needs a watch and this is ideal for him its cheap and it non breakable
At first, this seems like a pretty good drink shaker.  The body and lid are fairly sturdy.  However, there's a separate rubber seal that sits inside the lid...  And if that pops out, which it's prone to do with mine, you're left with a leaky (and therefore useless) shaker.  The seal can be replaced with a bit of effort, but who wants to wrestle with a plastic bottle
I have a 2005 Ford Ranger.  I bought this unit and fully read the instructions before starting the install.  After that I began searching for the right connecitons on the steering column and connected up the unit.  I went online to find the correct placement of the wires and downloaded a printout.   --- The unit installed well, worked fine after initialization.  Came with a video that really helped in the installation.  I find the range on this unit to be super. --- I have no complaints
Nice Quality, but overpriced.  Does a nice job of protecting the front of the lens, and reducing glare in some situations
Sticking the solar module on the side of the garage door opener like they instruct doesn't work--the solar panel has to be right next to the lightbulb to get enough power to work.  I was able to mount it close enough to the lightbulb and make a small cutout in the cover to get it to fit--you might not be able to depending on your garage door opener.  Also the bracket that holds the laser module has too light a hold on the module, it doesn't hold it in rotational position
My table was shipped on a Thursday and at my house the next day!!!  As someone mentioned, the directions make it seem more difficult to assemble than it is.  There aren't that many parts to put together. ---  --- A tip:  Because of the weight of the box, I recommend opening the box and taking the parts to their destination individually.  Ours is on the third floor and I took about three or four trips to get everything up there. ---  --- I use it daily and really miss it if I don't get to.  I could really go for some inverting right now.  I found the cuffs very comfortable.  Shoes/boots are helpful, but my body has adjusted to hanging from my ankles even in socks.  I should get commission on these things.  The first weekend we had it, we had a birthday party for my sister and everyone tried it and many will buy it.  GREAT deal!!
This is not a good study guide for an employment law class.  Too basic and general.  This may be good for a business owner wanting basic info about hiring/firing etc, but they would definitely still need to seek the advice of an attorney
This is very BAD---doesnot work and really interfers with other programs. Almost impossible to remove it.
For those considering Outlook 2007, beware of my experience: one morning I ran Outlook 2007 to find it would not download email messages at all. (I would get an error about MAPI.) This appears to be due to an automatic office update of the junk mail filter. ---  --- One of the most important features of an email program is that it doesn't suddenly stop being able to check email (imagine being on a business trip). Automatic improvements to the junk mail filter sounds great, but if that means one morning I wake up to not be able to check email at all, then the medicine is worse than the disease. ---  --- The new features and changes Outlook 2007 really do not compensate for the lack of reliability. If you have another email program that works, I'd stick with it and not switch to Outlook 2007. ---  --- On a positive note, I was able to fix the above problem by running repair (reinstall) from the Office 2007 install program, but this took half an hour or so to run.
I bought this for a present for my 2 yr old daughter and she likes it and can turn the handle
This game is amazing. Unlike so many other star wars games, this is a first person shooter, which is a great touch to the star wars universe. I found the gameplay to be very well done with the healing stations on the battlefield and your squad always with you to revive you if you fall in battle. The coolest thing of all is that instead of carrying multiple weapons, you have attachments to one gun. The attachments are sniper, and rocket launcher. The single player campaign is outstanding, though the multiplayer is so-so. This game is simply a terrific Star Wars title
This item was durable, warm, the right size as advertised and the right price.
For average people who want a camera that just works-and takes good pics you should not buy this. I don't know about the specifics, but like other reviewers mine got stuck and quit working for no reason after a couple of months. So, I don't really see what all the bells and whistles are for if it doesn't even take a picture. It was fine while it worked, it ate batteries but the pics were good
I bought this camera after using a Sony MiniDV (very small one) camera over 8 years. The image quality of Sanyo is horrible compared to my old Sony under any condition: daylight, night etc. However price, size and easy operation makes this camera a winner as you can have it with you all the time. So if you want to use this camera as a second camera for everyday use go for it, but this is not a serious replacement to a high-end camcorder.
These are easy to use and easier to tighten than the pull through type tie downs.  These will work well to hold a riding lawnmower or golf cart on a light trailer.  They are also good in pickups to hold your load if you have  loops inside the bed.  If you're hauling anything heavier on a large  trailer, get some serious tie downs like the Keeper 05516's
The product not only did not work but blew out fuses in my car.  The mechanic who checked my car out said the device had a dead short in it.  I have written to your customer service department and asked for money back but to no avail.  I will not purchase another thing from Amazon until my money is refunded
It is an excellent movie, very well directed and the acting is superb. It awakens the natural instincts of empathy, compassion and love, for children all over the world are the same, ir-respective of color or ethnicity
my daughter would love a trampoline and i would love to buy her one but i don't know which one to get her.  the airzone 8' trampoline seems perfect but i also read the reviews for the airzone 13' trampoline which got terrible reviews.  i don't know what to believe.  can anybody help
This has helped my wife and I to lower our cholesterol.  I take it in conjunction with Red Yeast Rice Extract(this must be taken at night) because my numbers are very high.  My wife's numbers are right on borderline.  We took blood tests before and after using it and have seen great improvements.  My numbers went down 37 points in a few months and my wife's numbers went down about half of mine.  (I also take double the dose she does.)  It's a great way to keep healthy, naturally.  My father-in-law started using it and has seen improvements, also.  His dangerous PSA numbers (prostrate) even dropped radically.  We don't know if that was due to the fish oil-but he believes it was.  His dr. said he'd never seen numbers drop that much.  We tell just about everyone we know about it. 
I bought this to replace a C-Strobe light I used as a tail-light on my bicycle.  The C-Strobe was bright, flashed bright enough to make car drivers complain, and waterproof, just not rugged enough to survive being run over by a truck when it fell off my backpack.  This one was by the same manufacturer with "strobe action" and 1/3 the cost. ---  --- It doesn't flash, the "strobe action" is the way it appears to flash as you go in and out of the side ring of light.  It isn't anywhere near as bright as the C-Strobe.  I'm going to get a C-Strobe later this month from a local boating dealer
This toy does not work.  I do not recommend it.  There is no quality to the workmanship.  A total disappointmen
The shelves are not sturdy and the pockets are very small...don't waste your money, it's not worth it!
I suppose one of the great attributes of the internet is that it allows the juxtaposition of the good, the bad and the ugly. Where else could one find reviews of one of the twentieth century's towering works that variously describe it as a recipe for a police state, an incitement to theft, or as written by someone with no understanding of philosophy (my personal favourite - thanks Adrian!
I have used Corel Draw for many years, and too many had serious problems. This version seems to make up for the past with a stable system capable of most anything artistic. It is still a complicated system, though
Not as expected, too short,   nothing special for the price - took forever to receive ( about 3 weeks
never got to see it because shipping company carelessly left it on my porch and someone stole it along with other items. contacted seller and u.p.s. both told me basically I was out $45.00. tryed to report it to amazon but they intentionally have no contact info. on their web site. live and learn won't shop amazon again! thanks 4 nothing amazo
In the world of gaming, there are specialized magazines for each system (PlayStation Magazine, Xbox Mag, etc.), most of which suck because they only report on (duh) games on their respective systems.  Others, like Electronic Gaming Monthly, encompass most systems but only do it half-assed, not really giving you anything to make you think highly of it.  Then, there's GameInformer.  There are many things that set GameInformer apart from many other "gaming" magazines: ---  --- 1)  They have completely unbiased opinions about the games they play.  If the game sucks, they say so; if it's an awesome game, they'll tell you about it. ---  --- 2) Matt Helgeson (Senior Gaming Editor) and the other editors actually inform you about the game's most necessary attributes: its ESRB rating (E to M), their rating for the game (from 1 to 10), and a brief introduction to the game's faults and successes.  Best of all, however, they include screenshots from the game- and most screenshots rock. ---  --- These are just some of the reasons that GameInformer magazine is the absolute best gaming magazine on the market.  I have a subscription to this magazine and this magazine only, and I hope my review has explained why. 
This bike trailer seemed like a great deal. When I assembled it and tested it out it worked great, seemed very safe and comfortable. My daughter loved riding in it. Initially I was very happy with the product, especially for the price paid. Unfortunately after several weeks in the sun all of the white nylon straps - used for support and restraints - began detoriating and breaking. I would recommend spending a little more on a bike trailer that uses a better grade of materials
This is the perfect companion to take on your next trip.  No more excuses.  The gym is now portable.  With enough resistance to give you a decent workout.  This gym rat highly recommend these bands. 
My daughter is very happy with the product. She not only got the MP3 player she wanted, she also got her favorite color "PINK". Thought we got a great deal and it has been working wonderfully. Infact, my son is now jealous that his younger sister has a better MP3 player than he has
After hearing "I'm N Luv (Wit a Stripper)" I don't know why anyone would want to buy and listen to this CD in its entirety. I'm not going to type a bunch of long paragraphs about why this CD sucks. This CD is a waste and T-Pain is illiterate. There! I said it in one sentence. Holllaaa
House of Mirth is one of the most depressing movies I've ever seen. ---  --- To be clear: I've seen movies like, oh, say, "Schindler's List," or "The Heart is a Lonely Hunter" that treat tragic events, either in the macrocosm or the microcosm, that did not leave me depressed. Rather, they were powerful works of art that moved me and made me think. ---  --- "House of Mirth" deals with tragic themes, including human society's ability to destroy its own, and the power of hypocrisy and hypocrites. It wasn't, though, moving or thought provoking.  ---  --- I wasn't moved by Gillian Anderson's portrayal of a betrayed woman who lives by her own sense of honor. I didn't believe Gillain Anderson's portrayal of a betrayed woman who lives by her own sense of honor. ---  --- Rather, I was bored. I kept wanting the film to go faster. It's a great irony; Edith Wharton's novels are real page turners. Quick, to the point. Hollywood has yet to adapt one of her books in a way that honors this quality.  ---  --- "House of Mirth" has gorgeous clothing and sets. I didn't care about anybody onscreen, though. I didn't believe anybody onscreen. ---  --- I felt that this movie had a misanthropic agenda, and it moved its players around as if they were chess pieces, as if to prove these points: people are hypocrites, see! People are insincere, see! If a person has any decency at all, that person is destroyed, see! ---  --- I would tend to agree with all of the above points. So ... why do I need to watch this movie? ---  --- Also, as a woman, who, as Lily Bart was meant to, has lived her life by her own code of honor and paid the price for that, I felt that this movie, no less than the Polite Society it depicts so brutally, betrayed Lily Bart. ---  --- Lily Bart is just a step above a passive masochist in this film. She all but participates in her own destruction. You want, just once, for her to show some initiative, some intelligence, some ability to create her own fate. ---  --- The film denies her those abilities. In this crippling of Lily Bart, the film seems to hate her as much as polite society does. ---  --- Movies like "Gone with the Wind" that depict spunky heroines occasionally winning, and occasionally gaining some power, imo, are much easier to watch.  ---  --- One might argue that such films are not realisitic. I don't know. Even we real-life Lily Barts have our resources, and our triumphs.  ---  --- And, again, watching Lily Bart in "House of Mirth" slowly being eroded onscreen was not a feminist experience for me. It was more of an art house snuff film that utterly disempowered its female heroine.
I checked the reviews on many types of dictation software before selecting Dragon NaturallySpeaking 8 standard.  I recently had my wrist operated on and knew that I would be unable to write utilizing my hand for quite a while.  As an online student going to college I had to be able to participate in discussion boards and research papers daily.  This software was unbelievably easy to learn.  I followed the directions on setting it up so that the computer would recognize my voice.  I spent approximately 5 hours learning to program, and practicing before I was operated on.  I found that if I talked at my own natural speed the computer utilizing this software did an excellent job of deciphering my words.  I found the instructions very simple to follow.  Yes there were times that the computer displayed what I said incorrectly, but correcting it was extremely easy. --- I was able to keep up with my class throughout the six weeks I was in a cast.  My arm is still in a brace and I'm still using the software on a daily basis.  I'm actually using the software to write this review.  I highly recommend this software to anyone that needs to write research papers or that does a lot of computer typing on a daily basis. --- I am such a strong believer in the software that I know I will continue to use it even when my brace comes off. --- I found the software very compatible and easy to use even to answer my e-mails quickly and efficiently. --- This might be the perfect software to get for any college student.  To be able to look at research books and talk into the computer as you're looking up reference material is truly beneficial.  It was also very easy to stop Dragon software when you needed to to take a break think what you needed to write next.  All I needed to say was "go to sleep" and the microphone shuts off until you wake it out. --- To sum it all up the software was very easy to use and easy to set up.  I recommend it highly. --- Boca Raton Florid
 --- I'm no writer, I was just looking for a nice small notebook I could take with me while trekking to use as a travel journal.  This notebook is a handy little item to have with me in my pack. ---  --- It is of good quality, very much worth $10 if you want something more durable than your standard spiral notebook.  I like the elastic strap that keeps the book closed.  The book opens flat, and it is bound well enough so the pages are not going to fall out like some notebooks when you open and close them too much.  Small enough to fit in your front or back pocket too.   ---  --- Overall 5 stars.  The quality and style exceeded my expectations, and it was shipped on time with no errors
THE  QUALITY WAS GOOD AND THE STORIES WERE ALSO GOOD. I AM ON THE LIST WHEN THE FIRST SEASON COMES OUT. THIS IS LIKE A TEASE
it makes cotton candy in 30 minutes because  it has to warm for 10 minutes then it have to put put the suger in the middle then wait til becomes webby then wait agian to turn it off. ---  --- PARENTS THIS MACHINE DOSEN'T WORK ONLY MADE WITH SUGER THATS ALL IT IS AND ALSO IT TAKES FOREVER ? THINK BEFORE YOu BUY  YOUR CHILDREN WILL GET CAVITIES YOU WILL ALSO SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS INSTEAD OF FOOD OR OTHER NEED ---   ---  --- 
This shaver has met all my expectations. It cleans and recharges itself automatically. The shave is close and nick free. The only slight negative is the cleaning time per shave could run to 20 minutes
I got this device to help me clean around my place.  I thought it would be easy to use, and it is  not.  The pads do not stay on.  When you are trying to put them on, the solution leaks all over you.  After working on my shower, I saw no difference.  I wish there could be negative stars because that is what this piece of junk is worth.
Comes in nice display box with cushioned spaces.  A quality time piece.  Band has a felt backing for extra comfort.  The smaller items are buttons that are afixed with tie tack type closures.
Final Fantasy VII: Dirge of Cerberus is said to be the last spin off (aside PSP's Crisis Core), and the one that goes furthest into the future of the VII world. The game seems like a must-play for Final Fantasy VII and Vincent Valentine fans alike, and it is. Thinking, most of those fans probably play mostly RPGs, this game is relatively easier than popular FPS (shooters) like Halo. Being an RPG-fan, yet still wanting to learn the story of the game, I was very happy for the easy difficulty (though it can be bumped up to something more difficult and there are plenty of extras that are difficult to get outside the story mode.) The controls are a little bad, but nothing that someone can't get used to. For one of Square's second or third shooter games, this one is pretty good. ---  --- I'd recommend if you're doing what I did and playing it for story, then get the official guide so you can get all of the hidden capsules as you go (which unlocks the cutscenes and once you retrieve them, you never have to get them again). The guide is actually pretty good for this game, as well as the soundtrack. If you're a fan of the Final Fantasy music, definitely pick the soundtrack up. ---  --- Lastly, if you're a Final Fantasy fan or RPG fan, get this game and everything related to it. It's worth it. I couldn't put this game down, even if some characters are a bit under-developed. ---  --- If you're a shooter fan for games like Halo you will probably be disappointed
A nice try but just not that useful, I keep finding it falling out and U think it ended up on the couch now
Don't buy this compass if you need to know any direction. If you know about where the sun sets, you will be more accurate than this "compass." It is impossible to use in the field. A waste of money: inaccurate to the max, impossible to maintain it level, etc. Just junk. They should give them away
The idea of a nice warm wipe is great, but the product falls short in perfomance.  The warmer is designed for a non-popup type of wipe box. (If you use pop up wipes, just the part sticking out of the box gets warm, and the rest is cold.  If you use the other type of wipe box, it works ok as long as you always keep the wipe box full, which isn't always realistic for a moms and dads.  I am returning mine to the store.  :
I always buy the same size and type of overalls and this is the first time ordering this pair from Dickies.  They are very stiff and tight fitting.  They should have actually been baggy on me, being the size that they were
I have this product working in my hair right now. It is simply wonderful!  ---  --- First off, it smells like lovely Victorian rosebud-almond pudding. It has a similar consistency. I can get about three to four uses from each container and I have very thick hair.  ---  --- My hair was preciously quite dry and abused. I had dyed it twice in the last six months. After ONE use of this product my hair felt better than it had in YEARS. Silky, strong and shiny. I love this product! I highly recommend it.
A very gentle undereye cream.  I have used other name brands which extensively irritated my eyes and made them tear all the time.  This one is definitely a keeper
After playing this game for 16 days, (I finally finished it after 91 hours of game play), I now understand why this game won over 40 game of the year awards, it is just-that-good! Try not to breeze your way right through it though, or you'll miss a lot of the wonderful things that this game can bring to your gaming experience. Take your time, and enjoy it. Not your average type of game where you just mash the button to attack an enemy, this game requires you to think befor you do things. It really is a fun game to play. And overall, that's what playing games are all about... having fun!
The crib tent did not fit our crib.  It's not deep enough or long enough. I called to try and send it back and they do not allow this item to be returned. I am very disatisfied with this company and the product.
am very pleased with my purchase, speedy shipping will use agai
If you purchase this lens adapter for the Xacti HD1A, you will not be able to take still photos using the built in flash. The adapter blocks the flash and causes black shadows in the bottom half of your photos
This is really a nice product for staying fresh and clean-feeling during long flights
Alec Baldwin has always been the best host of SNL (along with Walken and Spacey) and this makes a pretty good case why. ---  --- The opening sketch with the press conference about Prince Charles is priceless.  And what could be more demented than "Canteen Boy."  Baldwin is so over-the-top in that that what is a really, really sick joke is actually funny. ---  --- But the home runs come with three of the funniest sketches of all time: The Tony Bennet Show (I was seizing during this one), The Joe Pesci Show (with Baldwin doing DeNiro) and the "Zinger" sketch, which just got funnier as it went along.  Even better was the voicemail sketch where he keep re-recording his greeting, only to listen back to it and hear a gay man. ---  --- There are a couple of clunkers: "Planet Truth" was just not that funny and maybe two others didn't need to be here.  Including one so-so opening monologue that probably was only included because it included Paul McCartney. ---  --- The bonus features include one great sketch that never made it on-air, and a great audio track by Baldwin and the Producer of SNL which provides lots of really, really entertaining stories about the cast and the sketches themselves. ---  --- Absolutely hilarious
This is a great sterilizer, it's chamber is big enough to holder 4 to 5 bottles wide neck bottles and the tray can hold quite a few nipples and cap rings.  I bought it when my son was born and after a year, I'm still using it.  It works great, saves time, and has an auto shut-off function when the steaming cycle is complete.
I received my new Fossil watch just a few weeks ago.  At first, I was pleased with the watch.  The overall appearance is nice, its very dainty with a thin band.  The green dial is a pale lime green, not too bright.  Everything was going good until yesterday when I noticed the watch seemed to have stopped working (and this is only after 2 weeks of having it!!).  I reset the time and it started ticking again, so I thought it was just a fluke.  Now it is working sometimes but is generally running slow (the time keeps falling farther behind).  If this is a battery problem already I am very disappointed that amazon would send out a new watch with an old battery.  I expect to take this up with them, as obtaining a new battery isn't very easy because there isn't a fossil store nearby.  In the manual it says to mail in the watch for a new battery, which costs $15!!  How inconvenient.  I am not impressed
I ordered 1 for my twin bed to try out.  Loved it, so I ordered a full and kingsize too!  I find I don't move around as much as I used to.  A more restfull sleep
     Sorry to say I found this nail polish remover to be extremely drying, something I haven't experienced with other removers. ---  ---      In addition, it takes several applications to successfully remove just one coat of polish.   ---  ---       On the plus side, it's fragrance free and reasonable in price
i like clinique a lot i needed powder so i got it, in beige..i also like the double pressed powder for even more coverage..fast shippin
I was making a wedding cake and the bride wanted passion fruit mousse between the layers.I said no problem. Then I tried to locate passion fruit puree in my area(Sacramento).Couldn't find it. Thank goodness for The Perfect Puree of Napa Valley. The passion fruit puree came frozen, thawed beautifuly,and tasted fantastic.What a great product
Followed all directions, added fish, within hours the fish were "sleeping" on the bottom of the tank. Luckily they had not entered the never ending sleep so I took them out putting them in a bowl of water and after an hour they started getting better.  Changed the water in the tank this time using distilled water, added fish, 3 hours later they were lying motionless on the bottom.  took them out and put them in another bowl of water and they got better. Something is seriously wrong with this tank.  Bought regular plastic tank at the pet store added fish and guess what... they are doing great!  Do not put fish in the shark tank.  They will die
Who would sell an r/c toy car that runs backwards continuously?  It was a big disappointment for my granddaughter.  Tyco's Lighting McQueen was greeted with glee when it was unwrapped, and found its way to the trash with the day's wrapping paper.  POS
I have used OneNote 2003 for a couple of years now, and it is a fantastic program.  OneNote 2007 is a very nice upgrade.  It is extremely versatile and works with a variety of organizational styles.  I have gone nearly paperless for my projects.  I can pull in emails, web pages, graphics, scanned documents, MS Office (and other) documents, screen clippings (a OneNote feature), Excel tables, links to files and web sites, etc. OneNote 2007 adds a a better, more intuitive interface, and integrates better with Outlook (e.g., the tasks work together better) and other Office programs.  (Note:  I sue Outlook 2003 at work and Outlook 2007 at home, and OneNote seems to work fine with both).  It also integrates better with Windows Mobile Smartphones and PDAs.  OneNote2007 has a Mobile OneNote component that allows you to take notes on your PDA/Smratphone, and sync them with "Unfiled Notes" tab in OneNote. ---  --- A great program that is sure to catch major traction in the coming years
I bought this camera 3 months ago and have used it a few times. Last week all of a sudden the pictures look out of focus and over-exposed. I haven't changed anything or done anything. I have no idea what's wrong with the camera, but given the price I'm pretty annoyed and Amazon.com will not refund my money because it has been over 30 days
Both our son and his wife and myself are very pleased with the undershirts. It was very difficult to find the shirts that openned on the side, so I appreciate them being offered on your site and will remember the brand in the future.
This book is an excellent guide to building and managing an investment portfolio.   It doesn't promise that you'll make millions. . . but it does provide the principles and strategies you need to create an investment portfolio for long-term growth. It's intelligent, easy to understand, and practical. 
This has been a great tool in helping my kids understand why they should not eat junk!  Highly recommended
I hate all kinds of onions I don't want to have stank breath. The taste of those vegtables don't even taste right. I wish God never made onions
these ramps work well with my lowrider saturn,i can get up on them without scraping the spoiler,extremely light.a major improvement over the old metal ramps i used as a kid
I purchased this for my daughter since I had already had purchased one for myself.  The pictures are clear and crisp.  If I had to buy another I would purchase the same
Polarizing filters are used to eliminate glare on non-metallic surfaces like glass or water. They can also be used to increase the contrast and color saturation of your image. I use my polarizer not only to eliminate glare, but also to make skies a nice shade of blue or to get some "pop" out of clouds.  ---  --- There are so many options to consider when purchasing the Polarizing filter for your needs. For instance, linear vs. circular, film or digital versions, or quality vs. price.  ---  --- If you are making use of a TTL or auto-focusing system, Circular Polarizers are designed to work with those features. Linear Polarizers has their uses, but they are manufactured differently and may not work. Unless you are certain, just get a Circular Polarizing filter.  ---  --- There are some digital circular polarizers on the market. I am not sure what makes a cir-pl lens better for digital as opposed to film. I use a Canon 20D Digital SLR and see no problems caused by using a supposed non-digital filter on a digital camera.  ---  --- Most of the time, when it comes to filters; you get what you pay for. Does that mean you need an expensive polarizer? Of course not, just be sure to get the right filter for your needs. What ever polarizing filter you get, make sure it is color neutral to prevent unwanted tinting. Spending more on a color balanced filter will save time in post. If you need multiple filter sizes, consider saving money by using step down rings.  ---  --- Currently I use the Hoya Pro1 filters, as the Canon polarizing filters I previously owned were without question bulkier and heavier. The weight might not seem like much, but when you stick all your items in a backpack all the extra bits of weight add up quickly. I can spend a good amount of time with my equipment on my back so this is a big concern for me. When it came down to the images, at times I would see a browning tint on my photos. The tint is easy to clean up in Photoshop CS2, but I don't see that problem with the Hoya Pro1 filter.  ---  --- Overall, I would recommend against the Canon polarizing filters. I originally thought, "it is Canon, it must be quality." Since then I have replaced all my Canon filters. This filter works, but comes at a cost of disadvantages to other similarly priced filters.  ---  --- PROS:  --- Can be used for film or digital cameras  --- Eliminates internal reflections and ghosting  ---  --- CONS:  --- Bulky and heavy  --- Not neutral color balance
When John Grisham introduced us to Bendini, Lambert & Locke, a Memphis tax boutique controlled by the Mafia, the idea of an in-house firm for the mob was hilarious. These days no one, least of all our hero Scott Finn, is particularly sure that organized crime doesn't just control the firm, but also the governor's office, the US Attorneys Office and the Boston PD. ---  --- Finn, who worked and fought his way out of the streets of Southie to the thick-pile carpets of Boston's Brahmin legal establishment, finds himself back among the thugs and characters of the world he thought he left behind.  When a fellow associate and friend with benefits is killed by a copycat killer seeking to emulate "Little Jack" who was terrorizing the city Finn is drawn into the fray, where he acquits himself brilliantly while maintaining his place on the partnership track. ---  --- Finn even finds a new love interest in the cop who is trying, though not very hard, to put him away. And a childhood friend proves an invaluable ally as Finn attempts to clear himself and clean up the city in the process. ---  --- If it seems over the top, it is. But it is good fun too
I like these notebooks very much. The cover is very sturdy and the pages have a nice weight to them. The size is perfect for your back pocket or jacket. I use these books to jot down notes from meetings with clients. The small pocket in the rear of the book is handy for storing business cards
No brainer. ---  --- Easy to use. ---  --- Good value. --- 
I've heard lots of stories about people using beer on their hair and I will admit to trying it once. Cynthia Sylvia Stout is a much more pleasant experience with beer blended with fresh lemon juice, cognac oil and lemon oil. It looks a little like a chocolate syrup and I didn't think it had a very strong beer scent.  ---  --- Strangely enough, the scent sort of reminds me of freshly made whole wheat yeast dough (perhaps with a hint of lemon zest), which is currently baking in my bread baker. This is a very cleansing shampoo that you might want to use when your hair is misbehaving and needs a little shine and control. You may only need to shampoo once since this really cleans well the first time.  ---  --- Using this with the Veganese conditioner will leave your hair feeling super clean and not overly conditioned. If you want a deeper conditioning experience, try American Cream conditioner which is simply intoxicating. Please don't make me live without it!  ---  --- While I enjoyed using Cynthia Sylvia Stout shampoo, I still think my first love is Rehab shampoo (the scent of Rehab is divine). This shampoo did make my hair feel silky and soft so I'll definitely buy it again.  ---  --- ~The Rebecca Review 
Most waterproof mascaras are designed to come off with an oil-based remover.  Stupid idea;   our skin has oil in it.  After a couple hours we end up with "racoon" eyes."  DOH, who needs that?  Mirenesse mascara only comes off with soap AND water, in combination.  Better living through chemistry!  Since I happen to be one of those people with a little extra oil in their skin in adulthood, I especially appreciate this fact, plus they make it in Brown/black  I'm a redhead, and am so sick of   searching for something other than black-black mascara!  It is simply too dark if you are not a brunette or blonde.  I need something with some brown in it, and this mascara fits the bill, perfectly.  For those who find it too clumpy, well, learn how to apply mascara--tweens!  This mascara goes on best with one coat, so make your first application count.  You don't need a second coat.  It won't look good, so do one coat, period.  If you can't get it right the first time, you need some practice and a mirror with a higher magnification.  If you think you need more mascara than that, think again.  Unless you are walking Sunset
The amazing thing about commentaries is that you get to discover things you never thought you would, for instance... why the screenwriter used the title  DEAD AGAIN: its based on a story he read about a woman saying she was pregnant with her reincarnated husband. --- Anyways, enough of trivia. --- This film is a great ride.Branagh is so skilled in acting and crafting of film, theatre  etc, that he had to come into mainstream films at some stage. So, he was working hard in theatre, and he ( and his wife) discover a script about a murder that gives rise to events recurring years later. --- This film's  cast is superb. If you listen to Kenneth Branagh's  commentary, you will discover the most amazing connections. And throughout, they talk of this as a noir  film, well, I have no idea what that is, but this film is a great entertaining piece, and it is in no small part to Branagh, Emma Thompson, Derek Jacobi ( brought in 3 days  before he was asked to start, a last minute call), and others who made a wonderful film, and a solid entertaining piece. --- The DVD  extras are just the commentaries, but for this  type of film, thats fine, since that is complex  enough. --- ENJO
I ordered several of these for gifts for my family.  It is one of the "forever" books to keep for the rest of your life. 
First, I've bought the magazine just about every months (for 6 months) but I liked it so much that I've decided to subscribe for it. --- If you are into the shabby, cottage, romantic home decoration then you gonna love it! --- I must tell you that the pictures are sooo inspirational, that when I put the magazine down I can't resist the urge to decorate and come up with great ideas! However these fabulous homes/shops futured in the magazine look very expensive, cost lots of bucks to put together! If you have planty of $$, then it's not a problem but the average person doesn't. So that's the time to get creative! I'd say get the decorator books out too, that will help!  --- Personally I dont' pay too much attention for the articles since about 80% of the time the Shop/Home owners only talking about how much they like to live/work in their great romantic cottage environment, which designer helpd them to get the look or which part of Europe they flew to purchase that chandalier and so on...but not a word of advice about decorating! --- The other 20% of the time you get designers, or other people talking about THE look, etc. that is useful. There's also a great list of websides at the back of the magazine where you can shop on line or at one of the first pages quite often a few beutiful object futured (sometimes it's even affordable)! --- There are not too many adds here, like in other magazines that sometimes you can't find the end of the article..so that's a big + too!
The computer I have now(about 500 Mhz)is faster than my last one, and the earlier version of Plus! worked well with my older model. However, my current model can't process most of the programs available, so I just deleted the whole package. I intend to get a faster computer in the near future, and will use SuperPack at that time. The features look pretty cool, but I can't give it a favorable rating at this time. However, when I see how it would work with a faster processor, I may re-rate my review
I spent 3 hours putting this thing together.  All the parts were there and it all fit together okay.  After I finished I noticed that it seemed small for my Deck.  I bought this unit becuase it says it measures 11'8" square.  Well it actually measures 9'8" square.  So, now I have to take it down box it up and start again
This unit is simply stunning: a beautiful, harmonic, warm rounded overdrive sound.  Way better than any of the Boss boxes, check out the sound on the Dan Electro website. ---  --- I bought this based on sound not price, but that makes it all the sweeter
One earring was damaged and instead of replacing it as I requested, they "fixed" it.  ---  --- I will not be using Amazon to purchase jewelry anytime soon ---  --- 
I bought this recharger kit specifically for a Sandisk m230 mp3 player.  When I first received the kit, I charged all of the batteries.  Upon first use I only got 7min. out of each battery, when I got 20 hrs. from the batter sent with the player.  I learned online that the batteries still have their charge, but due to the battery's "memory effect" or "voltage depression," my player thinks the batteries have lost their charge after only 7min.   ---  --- If you are buying batteries for an electronic device that detects how much "juice" is left in a battery, do not buy this kit
Please advise me if I can get a new Plu in senor Temp wire plug in this item come in defective and dont work? Please advise ASAP  --- Thanks --- Walter Ga
These shoes are very comfortable, look great but I had a terrible problem with the "ruggedness" of these shoes.  I am an avid hiker and climber and bought these shoes for the reasons that Merrill is known for, ruggedness and great outdoor shoes.  After only owning these shoes for a month I noticed that the leather sides were cracking away from the sole.  This happened on both pairs of shoes and soon there was 2 holes in each pair.  The insides ripped from slipping them on and off.  I returned the pair to the store I bought them at and got a new pair.  The same problem happened.  These shoes are very cheap and very expensive.  Do not buy!  They look great but unless you are planning on displaying them only I would stay away from them
This camcorder has an excellent form factor and conveniently transfers clips to PC via USB. However, the camera picks up the sound of its own zoom and auto-focus, which makes the video unacceptable in my opinion. The clicking and whirring is louder than the level of normal conversation. ---  --- We returned the first unit that we got thinking that it may have been a production defect, but the second unit had the same problem. Apparently, according to the manual, this is "not a malfunction"
Kids played it one time and haven't touched it since.  Bought the extra tower attachment which was a complete waste of money. --- 
I have been using this shaver for 2 weeks now and have not had any problems with it. It is easy to use and clean I have only had to charge it once so far. Even though this is my first electric shaver, it is a good deal for the money. It doesn't shave as close as a razor but it's close. I would recommend it or give it as a gift. 
This was a great addition to the "Photography Basket" I made my grandson for Easter
Very solid, nice looking shelf, easy to assemble with good instructions and all required pieces included.  It's exactly as I expected it
We've seen several versions of Cinderella now and like this one the best. When my kids were smaller they liked the Disney version with the little mice but now they have thrown the Disney version out the window. I personally really liked the Julie Andrews B & W version due to the GREAT singing but my girls prefer and love watching this version while singing and dancing around the room as the DVD plays
We received this product for Christmas in 2005 and within two weeks the console broke. We contacted Schwinn immediately and was told we would receive a replacement console. It is now May 1st and the console we need is still on backorder --- 5 MONTHS!!!!! It is absolutely ridiciulous. I call each week and I get the same response. ---  --- Unfortunately, we should have contacted Amazon within the 30 day period to get reconciliation from Amazon. Lesson learned there. ---  --- The product when it was working was fine. But the pain since then is not worth it.  ---  --- I do not recommend this product
If you are looking for a great all around camera, this is it!  Our kids play sports and are in constant motion and the sports mode captures it all.  Also love the "Last 4" feature, gets some great action shots.  We had the Fuji 7000 before this and they have definately fixed the features that bugged me.  Love the new manual zoom (if you like 35mm lenses your like this) as well as the battery drain.  I used to have to replace batteries every day, now its more like once a week with the amount we use it.  My other favorite feature is the dual memory slots for those times where I forget to put it back in the camera after downloading!  So there is always one in there!.  The video comes out great and with the new manual lens you can zoom during video shots.  In general, without spending A LOT MORE, you get a great camera that keeps up with an active "picture happy" family
As was the case with the previous reviewer, I did not receive the item that was described.  It is not a Professional Outdoor Cooker but a Commercial grade cooker.  In addition, there are no baskets included.  This set-up might be fine for frying a turkey but would not work for frying fish without additional equipment.  What you'll get is what is shown in the picture - not what is described
This is a great "little" lunch box and I stress the word LITTLE. The way the bag is made if you put a medium or large bowl in it, when you carry it by the handle, you are carrying the bowl on it's side, which is ok if you are sure you secured the lids, but then when you go around the corner fast and it falls off the seat you start to wonder, did i really close the lid on the bowl right? sorry, i got of track there. Anyway, I use this daily and it does keep things cold and has two outer pockets that are great for utensils, napkins, gum and small things. Also, I have been using for over 3 months and it is quite durable. --- A great bag if you're only going to put a little yogurt, one or two little bowls (like no bigger than 9 oz) and a piece of fruit and maybe a sandwich if you don't mind it smushed. --- I'm actually shopping for a new bag now that is bigger to allow me to have cold drinks at work all day now that we are getting close to warmer weather
It is the coolest game about horses. It teaches the most important basic about caring for horses and riding horses. It is a bit confusing at the beginning and a little help from Mom or Dad should be welcome, even though my daughter found things that I did not, it's a team effort at the beginning. After that it's just very pleasurable, and can go on for ever. According to my daughter it is very addictive (!!) and she has already Dreamer and Lets ride. OK it's not high visual 3D as the others, but let's face it, a lot more entertaining. --- In all it is a real cool game, and worth the 5 stars. Perfect gift, and good for Mom and Dad also...
The subject provided a good historical perspective on Japan's Renaissance period, post civil wars and pre-westernization. In many respects Musashi, a Ronin represents Japan's search for an identity, a country ruled by military might in the form of the Shogun, yet keeping an Emperor who they revered as a god, a god without power. This Sword Saint was a man of great prowess with a sword of wood or of steel; he was also an artist, a lithographer and an author. Yet, he was masterless, masterless in a time when righteous was measured in a retainer's devotion to his master. He was his own master, in a time when Japan had no voice, serving all, without righteous. It would take an other two hundred and fifty years or so and a world war to release the spirit of the Samurai, that being honor amongst personal sacrifice a picture painted in the person of Miyamoto Musashi struggle for perfection and personal mastery of his profession, master of the sword
I recently have become more health conscious and am trying to eat more organic foods, staying away from hydrogenated oils, corn syrup, etc. You know, all the stuff that makes you fat:) This jerky is a great & healthy LowFat snack!! It tastes so amazing you'll never go back to any previously bought brand of jerky again..I LOVE Jerky and have tried many different brands..this jerky is well worth every penny and I'll keep coming back for more..thanks AMAZON for making it affordable
this magazine really gives you good info on piloting today
I wanted to buy this for my daughter. I wanted to combine a traditional record book with fill-ins with my new scrapbooking hobby. The outside is precious, but once you open it, the pages are like a black and white newspaper material, and they have no structure what so ever. The pages are boring and don't look very durable
Yes, I did feel a difference.  Benadryl is not effective for me so I was sceptical. I am glad I found this . I use for when I need to sleep in an unfamiliar place
Maybe I'm just not pro enough to realize the ways to put some more precise reports together, but that is the only snag in this otherwise capable product. ---  --- To accomplish the reports that I need, I am able to edit the Gantt chart view sufficiently to satisfy my purpose.  So, it gets the report done, just not as nicely as I had hoped. ---  --- Tracking work is made incredibly simple.  Rest assured you can manage a hefty project with this little piece of software
I think this is actually a very good OS. There are a lot of new features and Home Premium appears to be the best Vista OS for the money.  --- I purhased a new PC with this OS and have really found no compelling reason to upgrade to Ultimate for $150.  --- Only legitimate gripe concerns drivers for non-microsoft products. Not excatly sure why this is microsoft's problem though.  --- Regardless, this OS is the smart choice for a new PC for home use. Accept a minimum required graphics and audio card until suppliers catch up with this new OS. Then upgrade. Otherwise, wait till you need a new PC
It's just like you had in Europe or Latin America, and it they send it pretty quickly. As you probably know if you're ordering it, it's delicious for cooking/coffee uses and slightly nasty for everything else
People this is a brand new game out for the v-smile system.  Walmart has tuns of them in the store for 19.99!  Don't waste your money!  This store is lying!!!!
This tripod arrived on time and in good condition. However I have to put the "heavy duty" in quotations as this item is for amateurs mostly and is made of plastic as well. The weight you can put on it is limited. However it does the job well for the amateur photographer or videographer
INport, excellent job, I love the product and would highly recommend it to anyone.  I've had several hundred LPs sitting in boxes in the basement for years and now I'm rediscovering that music all over again as I transfer the LPs to the digital age.   ---  --- The quality of the transfer is very good (imo).  For example, I was playing back So. Central Rain (early REM) in ITunes and noticed that I had purchased the song on ITunes about a year ago.  Except for an opening click on the LP version, its very hard to tell the difference between the two. ---  --- My only minor negative (or really, feature request) would be for LPRipper to somehow integrate and automate song titles from the albums so that I don't have to type them all in. --- 
I got a hold of a Windows Vista Ultimate disk.  It gave the choice to install Home Basic, Home Premium, Business, or Ultimate.  I installed Vista Home Basic, because I only have 512 MB of RAM.  ---  --- Likes: --- I like the new wallpapers and the way it looks.  My Documents and My Music folder remind me of iTunes. ---  --- Dislikes: --- Don't like that my less than 6 month old HP printer doesn't work with Vista and my USB net link cable doesn't work with Vista.  When you install something screen slowly fades out and then a window comes up asking you if you want to run the program and trust it.  It's a little annoying because it forces you to stop what your doing and answer the question before you can continue.   ---  --- Verdict: --- I like it, but the incompatibility issues are enough for me to want to stick with XP. I wouldn't buy Home Basic.  If you really want Vista, buy a new computer with Vista preinstalled or install a trial version of Vista to make sure everything works.  I'm going back to XP, until HP releases Vista drivers for my printer. ---  --- I'll write reviews on Home Premium, Business, and/or Ultimate if I ever get more RAM. ---  --- My Computer --- 2.8 GHz Pentium D --- 512 MB RAM --- 128 MB Video Car
Kiplinger's Personal Finance is a worthy challenge to Money Magazine for a monthly dose of economic and investing trends, helpful financial tips, and - in KPF's case - a kind of populist advocacy for the little guy investor. ---  --- I came to KPF by way of the well-read hand-me-downs of one of Kiplinger Letters (for which, see elsewhere on [...]) that were pressed into my hands by my mother-in-law 25 years ago.  She probably thought that without I'd lead her daughter into the financial wilderness, where we would thirst and die in good romantic fashion.  ---  --- I eventually migrated up the Kiplinger food chain to the glossier KPF and have never left. ---  --- Much of the information provided by KPF (mutual fund and ETF results and the liek) are widely available. The same could be said of the investing advice (look for no-loads with low fees, diversify, don't bail under pressure). ---  --- Where KPF excels is in the short articles and tips, which have often prodded me to take money- and/or sanity-saving moves. Two fine recent examples: the articles in the September 2006 issue entitled 'Buy a 2006 car on sale?' and '5 things to ask about silk ties'.  Both of these articles provided solid input into two buying decisions I'm likely to make in the new year. What's more, the conclusions reached by these two authors are probably *not* the ones you'd anticipate. ---  --- In terms of marco-economic instincts, the Kiplinger Washington Editors run bullish, though not quite so much as Money's more cosmopolitan-posed writers. KPF won't lure you into buying quite as many fancy gentleman's toys either, a fact that is well observed by their authors, who tend to be mutual fund companies rather than designer suit or German auto makers. ---  --- Don't get me wrong, I read other financial rags and might not be as enthusiastic about KPF if it were my only source. But KPF's monthly arrival is still always welcomed, as it has been for years. It remains firmly entrenched in my top tier
My online shoe shopping tip: Buy a half size bigger than your normal size. --- If it's a little too big, you can always add inserts to achieve a better --- fit.  I also search the web for additional consumer reviews. ---  --- PROS: --- This pointy toed boot looks really sexy - A great bargain for 30 bucks! --- It's an easy to put on short boot.  --- (It goes up to the bottom of my calf - I'm 5'5) --- The leather is shiney and has a seamless look.   --- Stains will wipe right off. --- I'd recommend these with a nice pair of jeans or even for young --- professionals to wear with their slacks. --- Relatively comfortable.  I personally wouldn't wear them all day long. ---  --- CONS: --- Leather IS stiff.  Doesn't really bend with the leg when walking. --- I think that is what the previous negative review was referring to.   --- The inside of the shoe has a nicer softer leather. --- The zipper is not the best quality. ---  --- Hope this helps you make a better shopping decision! ---  --- * Or, you can always buy, try on and return.   --- If you choose the free shipping method and you want to return the item, --- you just have to go to the Returns section of the website and --- generate a return label.  Once Amazon receives it and processes it, --- they will give you your refund MINUS the shipping cost you saved --- when selecting "Free Shipping".   --- (It is usually less than 5 bucks and you can see the amount in "Your Account) ---  --- enjoy
Was not impressed.  Narrow scoped, personal reflections, applications limited.  I also read the male companion book Wild at heart and was also not impressed
I have been buying this brand of prescription goggles for at least 10 years. The price has been gradually coming down each year. I was surprised to find them so reasonably priced at Amazon of all places. These fit well, adjust easily and are extremely durable. I swim 6 days each week and I can easily get over a year of use from each pair. Typically the gaskets begin to deteriorate long before the lenses, when used daily outdoors in chlorinated pools. Keep them stored safely so the lenses don't scratch and rinse them in clear water after swimming and you'll be thoroughly satisfied with your purchase
I've purchased many of these products. I put this in my top three. Good refreshing lemonade with a nice raspberry flavor to give it that extra kick.
Intelligently written, beautifully illustrated and designed, this magazine is a must-read for beginning book collectors and veterans. It should be of interest also to non-collectors or accidental collectors who just happen to love books. Great features on authors and genres will interest many; succinct departments will help novice and experienced bibliophiles
Any easy to use, lightweight booster carseat. Highest scores from Consumer Reports made it our first choice.
Our hero,amoral in his love life, refusing to kick his unfaithful ex-wife to the curb, and making mystery solving boring, why continue? Parker can write like no one else, but his recent plots suggest the well may be dry
The shorts I bought came way over my belly button. Made me look like a funky old man. I returned them. Otherwise the sizing was good. ---  --- 
Acorn changed the sole of the slipper from a flat comfortable sole to an uncomfortable, rubbery, poor traction giving and painful sole.  I rather have cold feet then wear this slipper
Spend big bucks and hire The Boston Consulting Group to help you with your strategy . . . and what do you get?  Hardball answers that question indirectly through sharing classic strategies for achieving competitive and economic advantage employed by BCG clients. ---  --- As a result, I think this book will be most appealing to MBAs thinking about working for BCG and potential clients who want to get a sense of what the outcome might be like. ---  --- For those who are well read in business strategy, this book will be a disappointment.  It focuses on very little you haven't read or thought about many times before.  Skip this book if you are in this category. ---  --- The strategies discussed include overwhelming competitors with superior resources (Frito-Lay versus Eagle Snacks), adjusting to take advantage of what customers want more of (more variety and better delivery from Wausau Papers), threatening competitors' sources of profits (Japanese auto makers go after the Big 3's positions in minivans and SUVs in North America), copy and improve on better business models (Batesville Casket applies automotive manufacturing techniques), encourage your competitor to retreat (attack the bottom of the market first in low margin categories and move up), refocus your business model on one set of advantages (CarMax), acquire others to build your strengths while making competitors more vulnerable (Masonite International), and change the nature of competition (get to low-cost sourcing earlier than competitors, secure low-cost assets sooner and play the Wal-Mart card carefully).   ---  --- The overall metaphor for the book has its problems.  If you play to win, you are playing hardball.  Al Dunlap (author of Mean Business) was a hardball guy, but it didn't pay off at Sunbeam. ---  --- If I read past the words in the book, the concept they authors are advancing is one of being unrelenting in developing a strategy that creates a virtuous cycle of ever-expanding resources and advantages while creating a vicious cycle for competitors of ever-decreasing resources and advantages.  "Keep 'Em Down" would have been a more accurate title for the book. ---  --- You will find scant information in the book about newer types of strategies, new forms of technology and new business paradigms.  This book is about "rock 'em, sock 'em" competition among the industrial giants of the world.   ---  --- I worked as a consultant and later as a project manager at BCG in the early 1970s, and I was struck that the kinds of strategies and clients described here have changed almost not at all since then.  I do think Hardball better captures the classic BCG approach used in the early 1970s than any other book I have read published by the firm or its professional staff.  Bruce Henderson would be proud of you! ---  --- From my perspective, I graded the book down for slight inaccuracies in places such as underplaying the legal risks in these strategies (the authors seem to think scaring off competitors with "signaling" is pretty risk-free), misstating some of the cases (did GM really crush Ford's ability to get investment grade bonds by pushing for zero percent financing? -- it looks more like mutual suicide to me), and praising more than was due in some cases (the Japanese car companies were very late to come into North America with minivans and SUVs).  I also thought the metaphor got in the way of the message . . . rather than enhancing it.      
The magazine does have good information, but not for a child...it's more geared to an adult.  Watch out though!  They like to send you notices of collection if you do not renew the magazine when your subscription is up
As a young woman I was appauled by Gurian's lack of respect for --- women as human beings.What makes me the most furious is his  --- shadowy writing which can lead a young woman to think she is  --- only worth something if she squishes herself to allow the  --- boys and men to take the lead in life.The resounding message is --- girls and women are potentially inferior and cannot because of  --- our hormones make important contributions to society beyond  --- traditional roles.I don't remember ever being taken over by  --- hormones and rendered down to a emotional bundle of primative  --- chemical reactions he believes all females to be. --- I agree with posters about this bridge brain foolishness.Gurian --- is a master at twisting words around and you have to read his  --- books being mindfull of his tricks.His book is full of agenda.
This is a very nice leather bag.  It has two pockets in the front that the flap goes over.  The pockets do not close and I have found that you can lose things out of those pockets even with the flap closed.  That is the only problem I can see with this bag
I've been looking for a pair of headphones like this for years.  I've used these for 8 months now and wear them almost everyday.  I ride a motorcycle everyday and I never leave without these.  First, the comfort is exceptional.  Even with my helmet on, I never get uncomfortable with these in my ears.  I've ridden 400 miles at a time without any problems.  Even when I need a break from the music, I leave these in because they do such a great job of blocking wind and bike noise.  I've used several other brands of canal earphones and none have been comfortable - tolerable at best, but most are painful with a helmet on.  The "bulb" you see in the picture rests in the crook of your ear, so there is nothing extending past your ear to get crammed in deep.  Second, the sound quality is fantastic.  Great bass, mids, and highs.  I've heard things in my music I never knew was there and I can't wait to listen more.  I can't recommend these enough.  I've bought a pair for my brother and may have to buy a pair for my wife because she keeps taking mine
First, I want to defend this camera's lack of an LCD viewscreen--really unrealistic to expect something like that at this price point. ---  --- What's wrong with this camera is that it tries to do so many different things that it doesn't do the one thing it NEEDS to do well--i.e., take a picture with the push of a button. ---  --- This product would be much better if you took out all the settings (what kid needs different resolution settings on a cheap camera, for crying out loud?) and simply put in an auto-flash.  As it is, you must consult the manual, push the mode button until you find the correct symbol for the flash (which is NOT intuitive, so you'll need to carry the manual with you), press the shutter button to turn the flash on, wait for the little red light to come on, and THEN you can take a picture.  Then you shut it off or it goes off by itself after a very short period of inactivity, and the next time you want to take a picture you have to do it ALL OVER AGAIN! ---  --- Oh, and did I mention that it won't take a picture if there isn't enough light (there wasn't even in the brightest room in my house), so you MUST use the flash? ---  --- Clearly, the makers of this product did not test it on real children.  Heck, MY digital camera is easier to use than this!  We never even got to see the picture quality--after trying to get it to even take a picture, I knew this was going back to the store ASAP
This character Buckaroo Banzai played by Peter Weller is an incredible individual.  A well accomplished person who is half japanese, brain surgeon, scientist, martial artiste, and rock star.  He also knows how to ride a motorcycle. BB is backed up with a special hand picked team of men known as the" Blue Blazers".  In this episode they battle aliens from Planet 10 across the 8th Dimension.  John Lithgow stars as the demented Dr. Emilio Lizardo in one of his greatest roles.  Blue Blazer Regulars such as Perfect Tommy, Reno, Jersey, Rawhide, and Pinky Caruthers add to the amusement but Pacos is in Tibet. The characters are colorful.  As "another you", Ellen Barkin plays Penny Pretty who safeguards the overthruster.  Flaws with the script would be "Why would Orson Wells be giving the news during Halloween 1938 and changing it to H.G. Wells "War of the Worlds"?  I thought he did fiction like "Citizen Kane" not report news events of the era such as the tragedy of the Hindenburg Disaster for example.  Is Orson Wells related to H.G. Wells or Tom Cruise? The movie is entertaining.  We can see why Peter Weller today stars in documentaries on the History Channel.  I only wish there be re-issues of the "Kids From C.A.P.E.R."(Civilian Authority for the Protection of Everyone Regardless) Television Show originally aired back in 1975 and before they battled indians, the original "Ghostbusters" also '75 starting Larry Stork, Forrest Tucker, & Kong. The songtrack on these shows were great. BB & The Hong Kong Cavaliers are not The Monkeys. BB lacks a decent song track. At least we get to see the devote effort of saving mankind from world destruction armed only with slingshots, boyscout knives, and six shooters unlike today where Captain America can't even save himself or maybe it's because america is only doing a job we all know needs to be done.  The movie was put together well.  It is a classic.  Jeff Goldberg also appears in this film but I don't know why.  Anyway, "wherever you go, there you are"
This popcorn is rather bland. I purchased it because generally I like Newman's own brand and I liked the idea of Organic popcorn but it is flavorless. I would not buy again. 
 --- Cold weather will be with us for a while and nothing makes one feel warmer than being wrapped in a delicious flowery fragrance - that certainly is Chanel No. 22. It's a blend of white flowers that has resulted in a scent which is both sweetly innocent and sensuous.  ---  --- Continuing in their use of symbolism and numbers after the overwhelming success of Chanel No. 5, Coco Chanel and Ernest Beaux developed yet another fragrance, naming it No. 22 for the year it was presented.  ---  --- It may have been created in 1922 but it's as up to the minute as tomorrow, especially in the new spray. 
If you are a tinkerer or a professional mechanic this tool is a must have for owners of 96 or newer vehicles. Youre blind without this information and can only guess at what is going on with your car. I keep it in the trunk of my car so when ever the check engine light comes I know instantly what the problem is. ---  --- - tas
I bought this as a gift for a friend, and it was the perfect combination of brown leather for casual dress as well as the beautiful simplicity of silver to match classier wear.  Whether you're looking for something casual or more formal, this bracelet wraps it all into one
It's solid and heavy as a rock.....yet to see the purpose of this item defeated. --- Working great so far. It's just a bit heavy to handle at times
I got my first month(a horrible Green Day issue)and then nothing! Uh,what up? Its not that good of a magazine,I just want what I paid for
Incredible follow up to Rated R which I didn't think could be equaled and they did.  Flat out incredible songwriting, amazing vocal identity and muscianship at its best.  If you grew up in the 70's as I did and miss those albums that you would play constantly from beginning to end then this album is for you. "Go With The Flow" is one of the greatest rock singles of all time but you won't be skipping any songs on this disc. Baby Boomers rejoice, rock is back
i like this game i play it 4 times in a day with out stoppin
I like this album.  Its got a nice mix of old and new material.  Along with some live material.  Great to see PE still at it in this ever changing rap game
Spare me another movie about how the big bad Catholic Church makes life dull and arduous until everybody is rescued by a sexually liberated Mary Poppins. The film's agenda is all over it and Binoche's character is just too "practically perfect in every way." 
I've never had to use this product, and don't ever want to. But it's hefty enough to do the job. Keep it in your console box or velcro it close by. Not in the glove compart where you can't reach it when needed.  --- Price is right. I've ordered one for each member of my family. They say it's the best gift so far. I think that's because it's the thought that counts.
This Suduko handheld game was not user friendly. I returned it for a full refund
This book was so badly written that I just couldn't help writing my first review on Amazon. I NEVER bothered writting reviews. ---  --- While I fully respect the authors' decision in providing the book online under the Creative Commons license, and while I do not doubt the sincerity of their intentions, the book is a total f*ck up. And f*ck up is an understatement. ---  --- The book: --- 1) Is unorganized :- ---  --- I felt I was being bombarded by information from all directions. One moment I was getting ready to test a simple "hello world" module, and the other I'm suddenly faced with a some strange esoteric block diagram showing "how function calls and function pointers are used in a module to add new functionality to a running kernel." with strange function names that were not mentioned and do not get mentioned for the rest of the chapter. How the hell did I get here? It just pisses you off and breaks your thought process and leaves you clueless and frustrated. ---  --- 2) Is upside-down:- ---  --- I read chapter 3 (Char drivers) and I compare it to real device drivers and some things just don't match. The book seems very theoretical because the "real" device drivers call some other functions that are not mentioned at all. After digging in the kernel source files and googling the internet I realize that in the "real world" there is a whole driver-model and generic objects and what not. Reading the source code documentation and some online material I actually understand how the "real" drivers work. I still don't understand the stuff in the book. I start wondering whether there is any mention of the driver-model  and I find it in chapter 14 !!!!!!! The driver model seems, in my opinion, the first step to understanding how "real" drivers work and I find it after 14 chapters of utter nonsensce!! Not only that, the authors decide that "many driver authors can ignore the device model entirely" and "The complexity of the device model makes it hard to understand by starting with a high-level view"... surpisingly it was easier to understand from online sources and the source code documentation than trying to read chapter 2 in the book! ---  --- 3) Is sadistic:- ---  --- One thing I really hated was the carrot-and-stick approach the authors chose. First they give you a small tiny taste of a topic   which finally seems relevant and just when you feel you're about to reach somewhere, they do a complete u-turn and throw all kinds of irrelevant off-the-topic rubish that leaves you sorry you were so shamefull as to expect any better. You end up confused, annoyed, and duped. Like in chapter 2 when they presented the code for the "hello world" module. OK fine. Seems easy enough. You naturally assume that this is an invitation to write the same code yourself. HAHA WROONG! The book suddenly does a "make hello.c" without showing you the content of the makefile. It leaves you out to dry with your uncompilable-"hello.c" and goes on describing IN DETAIL seemingly random stuff. You are left wondering whether the makefile must have been something too obvious to bother noting down and you start wondering whether to try to create a simple makefile or continue reading the chapter "as-is". I chose the former. HAHAHA WROONG AGAAIIN! I ended up compiling my whole kernel source tree because of something they decide to mention only 7 sections later.(At least they mentioned it?!) ---  --- In summary.. I'd suggest you buy the book.. and (as "./Documentation/ManagementStyle" for another book says): "NOT read it. Burn it, it's a great symbolic gesture". ---  --- I don't think anyone could have done a better job at making a worse technical book. If you come across any online material that "recommends" this book, *QUICKLY* discard that material too .. without thinking. ---  --- This is a -5 stars book. It has affected me personally
It is all you could dream of in a art set.  Very organized and neat, I love being able to just get right to work.  I highly recomment this product for a level artist; it is a great bargain
Very convenient reading glasses. You could hang them on your neck when not using them, and not even notice they are there. They are very sturdy, and are flexible making them almost imposible to break. ---  --- Cons: Both sets I purchased I notice them to be on the narrow side. They sometimes can feel too tight to the side of your face.  --- The glasses are also not practicable to wear for a person with long hair, as the glasses would trap your hair against your face
The mask is WAY too tight, either that, or I just have an abnormally big head which I don't think I do.  It should be adjustable, and it's not.  Would not recommend this
These are really cute and a great alternative to the standard "Numbers and Letters" version of these foam tub toys. My 2 and 3-year old sons enjoy playing with them. No complaints here
All I have to say is great album
Initially the sensation made me giggle.  After a couple uses I got used to the process and have even changed my initial thoughts that the whole timing idea was silly.  My teeth feel cleaner, mouth fresher, and I'm hopeful that I will no longer get the "floss" lecture from my dental team. --- Now that's something to smile about! 
I bought this for my son's birthday last night since he is interested in music.  As I was wrapping it, I noticed half of the keys were stuck in the up position.  I took it out and managed to bang the keys back into place, wondering how many times I was going to have to do this.  I decided to test it once I fixed it because the toy just looked horribly cheap with very thin plastic keys (you can even see through them).  The dollar store has better toys than this.  The sound is horrible and uncontrollable.  The controls are worthless.  I'm returning it today, and good riddance
This tea tastes identical to the caffeinated kombucha, only it's decaf. Great and calming.  Price is great, too
I bought these not for my car, but to clean stainless steel in my kitchen, wash mirrors, that sort of thing. ---  --- I can honestly say I've bought just about every microfiber cloth out there, and none work as well as these. I can clean the stainless in my kitchen in minutes, with no streaks, no lint, just shine, and without using chemicals (just some white vinegar and rubbing alcohol in warm water.)  ---  --- I probably added a few years to my life with all the time I've saved with these cloths. I highly recommend them
This book started well, but fell flat in the middle. What little conflict there was in the beginning was resolved halfway through. Even the shooting incident couldn't manage to hold my interest because it was resolved so quickly. ---  --- Well, I didn't bother to finish it--I have limited time for reading, and I don't like to waste it. --- 
It's a useful tool. Combined with another Norton's products GHOST, you can easily perform PC maintanence using these tools
I hate to trash on an American Classic... but this was truly horrible.  I thought my son would like this due to the flying car.  It took hours of TORTURE to get to that scene.  Horrible, horrible film.  Mindless, drawn-out banter, and weak story line.  Our copy eventually broke (stepped on?) --- we felt SOOO lucky to have it gone.  "One Star" seems like a generous rating
This is a perfect example of false advertisement. If you're like the many that i've heard of trying to order a remote for the Playstation 2, Don't order this one unless you have a newer model. The picture shows an IR unit but it doesn't come with one. So save yourself the hassle and don't order this
I haven't received this product yet and I'm pretty upset about it. --- I've requested that someone contact me about this problem and I haven't been given an answer.  I think I'm deserving of some sort of discount or at least an answer.  ---  --- Where is the product I bought???
My 3 yr. old son use it everyday to brush his teeth and comb his hair.  He doesn't tip over and fall anymore like he did on the other step chair.  The babybjorn is a bit expensive.  I found a similar chair at Ikea for a fraction of the cost. 
This is a traditional telling of the life of Jesus, from before his birth to the resurrection. --- The cinematography is breathtaking, the color, the costuming, the writing aided by Carl Sandberg is flawless and inspired and the scene of Jesus weeping and then raising Lazarus from the dead is awe inspiring. It was this scene which motivated me to write this review. --- Rather than showing us a thunderous awakening from the dead within the tomb, Stevens has Jesus lift the hem of his toga and make the difficult climb up a rocky bluff, puffing all the way to the tomb on top of a hill. Once there, Jesus strikes a pose made popular by the style of Ivan Mestrovic and the French bronze sculptors of the mid twentieth century. When Jesus reaches the high tomb, Stevens and Sandberg compose a masterpiece of prayer to the God of life before Jesus calls out, "LAZARUS! COME FORTH!"  But in striking juxtaposition, Stevens pulls back the camera, hundreds of feet from the tomb showing Jesus, the Son of the Almighty, as a mere speck against the infinity of the countryside, let alone the universe, much as the fist fight between Charlton Heston and Gregory Peck in BIG COUNTRY, shows the scale of man to God's work. However, as Jesus calls-out Lazarus instead of seeing him rise, we see the wonderment, the bewilderment, the fear and love of men at the prospect of one man raising another from the abyss. We see in the crowd, as the camera dollies, rolls and scans, the faces of the believers, the unbelievers, the doubters and the ever faithful, their reactions to a man dead three days, reawakened by an act of God, brought forth by a human being, favored by God. --- How much more effective was this direction? Rather than a straw man of seeing the dead rise, we see instead how people like us would react to such a thing, the awe, the tears of joy, the fear, the love, the attempts to reconcile with reality, the unbelievable. There was no better way to show the spectacle and that scene alone is a must-see for an aspiring  artist or film director. My only complaint about the film is a nitpicky one, Jesus' (Max Von Sydow) hair is too short. --- If you believe, clap your hands, and even if you don't, its worth the 199 minutes of your time. I saw the film with friends when it came out in 1965 and own the VHS and DVD, and watched it with a group, one of which was a self-proclaimed atheist-he had tears in his eyes at the Lazarus scene. --- 4.75 Star
I've purchased this watch from mid-watch company- as you can see It's a fab casual watch and is worth the price. --- the service was great and on time, and I am very pleased with this purchase. --- thank you
This product only works properly if you have a phone line and are using skype.  Do not use this product if all you plan to use is skype, it does not react well to this scenario.  But, if you are looking for a way to get cheap long distance for your existing phone service this is a great device
I have used Tend Skin for around three years now for razor bumps on the bikini line. Before I started using it, I had tried everything else and resigned to the fact that I'd always be stuck with bumps along the bikini line. A friend of mine told me about Tend Skin and swore by it, so I bought a small bottle. It seemed like it was expensive, but that first bottle lasted well over 6 months. It does smell like alcohol at first but the smell goes away when it dries. As far as the other reviews on here, I've only had stinging when I used it IMMEDIATELY after shaving...I think b/c the pores were still open from the shower. For me, it's been a skin saver when I'd already given up the search. I hope that the negative reviews on here don't discourage people from trying it. Everyone's skin reacts somewhat differently. Of the millions of bottles of Tend Skin sold every year, I think the half dozen people on here who didn't like it are the few unhappy rarities, not the average who, like me, thank goodness it's around.
Wonderful for getting all of your trigger points in your back especially, but also in your neck and feet.  Your body feels so relaxed after using the TheraCane. 
This was a film I was anticipating becuase of the actors doing the voice over and the special effects.  As far as animated features go this was the biggest dissappointment.  The acting was good but Robin Williams did not receive as much screen time as Ewen McGreagor which meant it wasant as funny as it could have been.  But the major problem was the story.  Yes, it did have a good moral but the rest of the films story was weak, boring at times and just silly.  I would recommend Ice Age or Garfiled: The Movie rather than this film
This car charger does what it is spposed to do and the price is right
Had mine for almost 2 years now and it works great, I use it for my violin. My teacher has no problems with it. Easy to use and simple.
We used this remote to program a Sony AV-RM3000 remote, but we need more flexibility for our HTPC.  In hindsight, we should have bought a stand-alone IR unit and something like the Girder software.  Or, maybe just an IR wireless keyboard. ---  --- This is not a remote for those seeking flexibility, or those who like to customize their media experience.  This is an excellent remote for those who want out-of-the-box usability, and don't want to bother with customization.  It's well-built, and will be exactly what many mainstream users are looking for. ---  --- Pros:  Comfortable shape, sensible layout, high-quality feel, reasonably compatible with many programs ---  --- Cons:  Doesn't do absolutely everything in every compatible application, only four somewhat-programmable keys with limited option
The instruction manual in EQ2 is quite addiquate regardless of class. Things you are not sure of are learned as you go or you can post on numerous forums for answers. ---  --- Since there are stats on top of stats and such vast areas with tons and tons of resources and itesm to be had, this book helps you get an idea of the "where" and "what". As in where you may find X or what Y actually does and realated stats. Its a reference guide. But as this game is so dynamic, this book has a limited lifspan and as you develop in the world you will find it to be "old news" rather quickly
Great movie but CD not perfoming in the last few scenes.  It gets stuck or restarts itself.  Very frustrating and more frustrating to have to return new CD
This straightener is great for thin hair... but not for thick. I myself have very thick hair and this straightener usually leaves my hair looking frizzy and very poofy. The best hair straighteners out there are about 1" thick or less and they normally have glass plates. So if you have thick hair, spend a little more money on something with a lot more quality
I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 because their customer service (communication and such) have been very good. ---  --- I purchased this bracelet a few months ago and (a few days ago) had the unfortunate experience as the previous reviewer. I was taking it off and it snapped in the middle.   Once you could see the insides, it was obviously not pure Sterling Silver as the "materials" portion indicates.  I will be returning this item for a new one (already gave my girl a matching one) and may not even wear it at all... ---  --- *very disappointing
I bought these lounge chairs because of the other positive reviews I read on them.  I have to say that I am very happy with them too.  The color is a very nice antique color that matches the set we got a Costco a few years back.  I can't wait for those warm summer days and evenings to sit around the pool and enjoy lounging in these chairs.  They are not too heavy, so they will be easy to move around.  They are heavy enough that the the Santa Ana winds we have here in beautiful Southern California did not blow the chairs around at all.  I think the price for these is a very good price for the value and would recommend them.  I only wish you could pick your color for the material on the cushions.  The beige color matches what we have but is a little drab since our house and patio cover are the same color.  I see they sell replacement cushions in different colors, but it would be nice to have a choice in color when ordering the originals
We purchased the Mega ball and have made ice cream twice in 2 weeks. The kids think its great. It takes a good half hour or more, but worth it. Make sure you have a really good stiff plastic spatula for scraping the sides of the container, it can be hard to get off. Really easy to clean
I decided to get this office suite after using it recently. I've usually worked on Office 97 and 2000, but the 2003 version has some pretty cool features not found in the older versions. The feature that I really enjoy is the Pivot Report feature in MS Access, which wasn't in MS Access 2000. This is a truly great reporting feature. You can now use Access as a front-end to slice and dice data stored on data warehouses in Oracle, SQL Server, Sybase and other enterprise-type databases. If you're used to creating crosstab reports, you'll definitely like the Pivot Report feature. Crosstabs are limited to 2 dimensions but there's no limitation on the number of dimensions in Pivot Report. ---  --- To me, the main drawback is the price. (I did get mine at around $370 at J&R, which is a great price.) I figure I can upgrade this in about 5 years time, which works out to about $70 to $75 per year (assuming that I'll be paying about $370 to upgrade in 5 years time.) ---  --- A big positive is that this is the industry standard. So the work you put into learning the multiple new features of Word, Excel, MS Access is not wasted because you can reuse the same skills in another job. Your time will be well spent. Note that the software may seem bloated but the intelligent user is able to choose and pick the most useful and relevant features of each application and ignore the features that are not useful. Different features are useful to different people... ---  --- Another positive: Each product in Office Professional is fully programmable using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) which you can use to build custom programs. This very powerful feature is sometimes overlooked when shopping for Office suites. 
Off-hand, I can't think of a worse movie. (And I think Nicolas Cage has done some truly awesome work in other films--hey, he's making a buck, here.) That's all. 1/32 star, if possible
After just over a year, my lens jammed and the display read "e18".  So I was pretty upset to discover that this is an extremely common defect - and a defect that Canon refuses to admit.  Try Googling Canon S500 e18", and you'll see what I meant. ---  --- Don't buy it unless you want a very expensive paperweight
my door handle was to the left and therefore could not use although product said that this lever could be used on all lever handles--shipping costs were more than item purchased so it would cost me way too much to try to retur
These gloves should really be called "Simulation Leather". They are warm and comfortable but the outer layer is some kind of thin black plastic that looks like leather. ---  --- I wouldnt feel comfortable riding a Motorcycle with these, if you hit the pavent with them they'd probably just vaporize.
I purchased this speaker about four years ago to complement my Bose main speakers for my surround sound set up.  At that time, I felt the sound quality was pretty good but over the years as I listened to other center channels that other people had in their home theater set ups I came to realize that the Bose center speaker sound quality was not up to par.  So last year, I purchased a Polk center speaker and the improvement in sound quality is absolutely insane.  The Polk speaker which costs the same as the Bose ($199) was far and away the better product.  The sound is cleaner, crisper, sharper...it made watching movies much more enjoyable.   I couldn't believe what I had been missing out on all these years.  The only reason I purchased the Bose was to match my speakers but that was a mistake because the sound I have now with Polk center and Bose main is excellent.   Depending on who you ask, the center speaker is the most important speaker in a home entertainment audio system.  If that's true then I wouldn't recommend Bose because all you're doing is buying the name and not the sound quality and to me that's a waste of money.  I know because I made that mistake. 
A comedy featuring four sexy stars as representatives of Heaven (Fanny Ardant, Victoria Abril) and Hell (Gael Garcia Bernal, Penelope Cruz) battling over the soul of a Mexican boxer is promising, but this attempt at satire, full of symbolism (Hell is represented by English-speaking executives, for example), is clumsily executed, only rarely amusing, and the superb Fanny Ardant is not given anything to do.  What a waste! You'll be better off watching any of the other movies each of these stars has done for more talented directors.
I actually know where Trieste was before I read this book.  Unfortunately I have never visited the city.  I wanted to read this travel book about this famous city, but after a few chapters, I wondered where the book was going to.  After the final chapter, I still do not know what the author's intentions was with this book.  Perhaps I don't read too many travel books.  Obviously the city means a lot to the author, but she did not express it clearly in her writing.  I was scratching my head at the end, and wondering what I read. --- I learned a little about the city, but not in relation to the amount of time I spent reading this short book.  The city of James Joyce and Maximillian.  The imperial port of the Austo-Hungarian Empire.  The meeting point of Slav, German, and Latin Empires.  One of the ending points of the Iron Curtain.  This city breeds interest and yet the author took us on a round about journal that confuses the reader.  I am sure the author's other books are good, her last one was not the greatest. 
I loved this product.  My baby slept in it until she was able to turn over.  She resisted swaddling, and this was a good way for us to keep her feeling secure in the crib.  I agree with the other reviewer that you must be careful, particularly with tiny babies to position the velcro sides correctly so baby will not wiggle down. 
My 3 boys (ages 4, 7 and 9) love their lightsabers so the idea of a spring activated version was too hard to pass up.  Imagine the disappointment when the fragile spring/force action is only good for about 3 tries and then it falls apart with no way to get inside and fix it.  We have 3 of them (Darth Vader, Obi-wan and Luke Skywalker). Vader was done before 9am Christmas morning. The other two are hanging on by a thread and now the boys have to be "very gentle" when they load the saber. The worst part is that the light up feature is tied to the spring so it does nothing now.  These are not rough kids and it's just a matter of time before the other springs get jammed.  Stick with the original light up sabers and forget the force action. 
These wipes are very rough.  We bought these when our daughter was first born and I ended up not using them on her because she would scream everytime I used them.  If your baby has sensitive skin I would recommend the Huggies Newborn or the Huggies supreme wipes.  Wipe your face with one and you will see how scratchy they are.  Imagine how your baby's bottom feels afterward
Love that when amazon deletes all the reviews for a product! Well, this one used to have about 3 five-star ratings. I added my two cents- this product did nothing for me whatsoever. So, some people love it. I don't get it. And, it's pretty much the opposite of an anti-oxidant, so that doesn't make sense. I pointed this out in my review. Wonder if vendors have the choice to delete all reviews if they get one bad enough? ---  --- Also, it's listed at $45 on amazon as well. from the same supplier. huh
I tried this coffee on a whim. My husband and I really enjoy our single serve coffee maker. We easily use up an 18-pak in 2 to 3 days between the grown children and us. This coffee has very smooth taste and mildly strong in flavor. It is a very nice coffee that can be enjoyed daily
The glasses are well made but I found them awkward to use. They didn't fit comfortably and it took quite a bit of time to get them on. The gimmick sounded cool but didn't work well for me. Every head is different, so maybe they'll work better for you
These tops were cute, for my 7 & 10 year old neices.  How in the world did they justify putting a size 2x on these things? 
Thank you for sharing Laci and your story with me.  This book is superbly written and shares with the reader a Mother's love for her daughter and angst over her murder.  How tragic to lose Laci.  How disgusting & heartwrenching what you had to  endure since Laci went "missing".   ---  --- I highly recommend this book to all.  Beautifully written by a loving a mother
How did he have the time to write such a picture, to co-direct it, to act in it and after everything else to write its score?  Noel Coward's energies, always remarkable, were redoubled during the second World War, and it must have seemed like another excuse to show off his patriotism, which he wore like a second skin despite his slummy upbringing.  IN WHICH WE SERVE is still worth watching, but it's nowhere as appealing as either CAVALCADE or THIS HAPPY BREED, and its focus on the "life and death of a ship" (the HMS Torrin) is strangely monomaniacal, almost constructivist.  Over and over you see unattributed bare arms hammmering away, symbols of brute strength like something from a Soviet film.  The ship goes up.  The ship goes down.  A new ship rises out of the water.  And in between Coward tries his hardest to keep you interested in the lives of the men clinging to the lifeboat, till our interest settles on three--Bernard Miles as Hardy, with his striking, long, hatchet face and the deep voice that goes with it--he should have played Ichabod Crane--John Mills as Blake, a tiny little pipsqueak who's feisty in the standard Mickey Rooney-Jimmy Cagney manner, and Noel Coward himself as Captain Kinross, tranquil with class privilege and, in the background, his glamorous marriage to the ineffable Celia Johnson (so beautiful till she opens her mouth and those bits of teeth wobble around on her gums). ---  --- Hitchcok's LIFEBOAT had the same concentration on a handful of downed and wet actors playing nautical, but without Coward's complicated flashback structure.  Coward stalwarts Joyce Carey and Kay Walsh show up as the love interests for Miles and Mills respectively--Carey, in this movie and in BRIEF ENCOUNTER as well, treated very unusually for the 1940s as a woman not in her first youth, nor good-looking in any way, who's given nevertheless a fullblooded and physical romantic interest.  She must have kissed the ground every time Noel Coward walked on it.  Who else would have written such roles for her? ---  --- The movie is trying indeed when it goes "serious," and yet that's half the fun of it, seeing how often Coward plays the "race" card--"we are an island race" indeed.  I teared up, of course I did, during the Blitz as the V-1 rockets drop bomb after bomb on London households, leading to the death of several favorite characters, and again when Coward leads his naval boys into Dunkirk and out of it again with a panoply of half-nude British soldiers sipping tea or what looks like an enormous vat of Kool-Aid.  Outside of these scenes, however, the movie is marred by its agitprop and by David Lean's tiresomeness, in showing everything at such a glacial pace.   ---  --- PS, the film was shot by Ronald Neame who later became a director himself and whose "masterpiece," THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, sometimes seems like a shot by shot remake of the disaster sequences of IN WHICH WE SERVE
As one of the founding fathers of today's heavy metal rock music, Iron Butterfly has them power, drive, and sound that made them unique in the world of rock music. This live album serves as a testament to that fact. Eventhough the recordings of live concerts from the late 1960's through the mid 1980's was primative at best (by today's standards), this live recording of Iron Butterfly captures most of the groups best music durring their prime as a chart-topping group of that era. This is a "must-have" for all Iron Butterfly fans
Darren Aronofsky's movies are beautiful masterpieces. From "Pi" to "The Fountain", going through "Requiem For a Dream", they will forever stand as timeless jewels. So they are hard to top in any way, but Clint Mansell has been able to do it every single time, scoring each of them. ---  --- For "The Fountain", he teamed up once more with Kronos Quartet and had Scottish post-rock band Mogwai join in too, to produce a score that fits the movie like a glove, in a very organic way. The central theme to the movie is instrumented in a way that works fantastically well across all the time periods the movie encompasses. ---  --- The combination of the talents of Mansell, the Quartet and Mogwai yields a relatively dark, yet breathtaking musical piece that will stand the test of time much like the movie it was meant to score
It was just what I wanted - I wear this ring on my pinky finger and it looks perfect.  Color clarity and triquetra pattern are striking
I got to page 26 and gave up.  Lockes writings lack focus and are void of humour.  I read as much as I could with patience until it became clear this book was simply someone rambling on about nothing.  Save your money for something worth reading
the very day i received the armor abs 2, i used it, and all the bands came loose that same day. i see why it is so much cheaper than the 6 second ab
I was expecting a good thing after all the positive reviews.  It was even better than I'd hoped.  The first container was entirely devoted to fluffer nutters.  I had to fight my boyfriend for the second container and he could eat the real stuff if he wanted! ---  --- Once I was down to just a little fluff stuck to the sides of the container, I used strawberries (alright, and the occasional finger) to scrape the last of it out. ---  --- A great product is one thing, but this company has great customer service, too.  I called the store because I had a question about another one of their products.  They were extraordinarily helpful and friendly.  Even though they were very busy, I wasn't rushed off the phone.  They treated me like my business mattered a great deal to them.  This is a rare thing to find in today's corporate landscape where the customer is treated like the most unimportant cog in the machine
My wife purchased this toy box at our local Toys R Us.  It went together fine, but ours must have been factory defective because the entire thing smelled like WET PAINT.  In fact, we had to return the unit because the fumes were making our daughters cry whenever they went into their room. ---  --- Little Tykes makes this unit, but they were of no help when I called customer satisfaction.  They told me just to return it and that they've never heard of this problem.
This disc dates from Monk's early period before he achieved recognition and started to descend into a long series of formulaic recordings for Columbia. So it's valuable from that point of view. It's also a wonderful chance to hear him showcased without horns although the standard is perhaps not quite as high as the trio Blue Note recordings that immediately preceded it. The best tracks both from a musical and recording quality view point are an extended Blue Monk, which many consider the definitive version, and a lovely unaccompanied Just a Gigolo, which anticipates later solo masterpieces such as Alone in San Francisco. Sweet and Lovely is in a similarly reflective vein. Much of the rest of the album has a forceful, driving quality, with aggressive use of dissonance in places - even for Monk. A particular highlight is Monk tearing through These Foolish Things
This is a great pump for a mom who only needs to pump once or twice a day. Let down happens very quickly and I can get 3 oz. in 15 to 20 min. My baby is a month old and I use this pump so I can occasionally leave my baby with a sitter. Geat pump at a great price
I highly recommend Microsoft Digitial Image Suite 10 and the free GIMP programs for ALL of your digital imaging needs!!!  (...)  DIS 10 should be out now..
Baby is happy, eating well.  What better praise for a bottle nipple can be given?  Note: Fast flow is for age six months and up, the slow/medium flow nipples by Avent are just as good (just for younger babies
The ad and description clearly state that it includes both a receiver and transmitter.  I received only a receiver. This is false advertising and is patently illegal. They ought to be ashamed of themrselves
 This is a great movie full of adventure and excitement.  Pokemon 4 ever takes place  during the period of the time when Ash is in the Juto League.  In pokemon forever ash   must protect the beautiful pokemon celbi from the evil Iron Masked Marador of team rocket. ---  --- In this movie you get to she something you never got to  she before  Professor Oak as a little boy.  If you are 7 or older than this movie is fine for you.  If you are under 7   this movie may be to intense and violent for you to handle. ---  --- My favorite part in this movie is when Celebi  makes the twig monsters  and start destroying the forrest.  Attribute to toho who created Godzilla.  If you enjoy this you the other pokemon movies.  I also recomend Digmon the Movie.   ---  --- This movie also features a short chute little min movie called Pikchu's Pekaboo which should be fine for  kids age 7 an up
I wasn't expecting Disney, but I was less than thrilled by this feature.  I'm assuming there's a genera of animation produced in the mid 70's that took the whole 'stoner' heavy metal thing and ran with it.  Many many long drawn out scenes with rock music and psychedelic colors that did nothing for the story.   ---  --- I am an animation junkie and will watch anything and everything, but I couldn't get through this whole film
Wow there are so many parts of this movie i just simply did not remember. But still a great movie, especially with the deleted scenes. They are not up to scratch but i am not holding it against afterall the movie is 18 years old. But still allot of fun to watch
This magazine should really be titled "Better Living Through Buying Stuff." It's beautifully designed but during the course of my subscription, the only important thing I've learned is how to fold a sweater. I will not be renewing
I'm on child number 2 with this chair, and my complaints are the same.  1. They tray is way too high for an infant/young toddler to reach anything.  My son is 8 months old and he can barely see what is placed on top of the tray. --- 2.  It is a cleaning nightmare.  I am still finding food from my first born hidden in this chair!   ---  --- Good points: --- -pop off tray --- -divider that keeps them from slipping out --- -cool colors ---  --- I tried a friend's cheap Evenflo chair and I loved it 100 times better and it cost over 100 dollars less
This is a very uesful tool , easy to use and operate. --- slim body easy to handle and control --- long cable to use in and out of the vehicle --- Got the cable to download updates but nothing on the web site yet --- It could use a backlight hard to read sometimes --- Overall a good tool to have in your tool bo
If you do not have a mediocre-level understanding of Chinese, stay away from this product.  Rosetta Stone has a very unique approach that might work for children under the age of seven (the critical language learning years), but for every other beginner in the language the software is almost impossible to use.  The object of the "game" is to match a Mandarin phrase (said aloud and written in pinyin) to a poor, pixellated photo.  For example, in the first section of the first lesson, you are shown a ball, an airplane, an elephant and a horse.  A phrase will be read and you have to match it with the correct photo.  It gets much too complicated after that.  Basically, it's a pure guessing game for most of the time.  I gave this product a serious evaluation even after reading the plethora of poor reviews.  I thought the unique style was interesting enough to give a chance, but I feel as though I wasted hours and hours.  I can remember only two or three words from the entire experience.  Although I have spent fewer hours on Pimsleur's Mandarin audio lessons, I am able to recall many, many more words and phrases.  Although Pimsleur's isn't perfect, it's definitely the best choice for a beginner (along with a solid Chinese-English dictionary). ---  --- If you do not know well the basics of Mandarin, this software is completely useless.  Buy Pimsleur's instead
Product was recommended by my teacher, works just as he said it would
I was very disappointed with the Ironman Speed Jump Rope. It is made of cheap plastic and, even after a month of hanging from my 2nd floor banister with a weight on the end, it's still coiled and kinked. It's impossible to jump with it as you never know when one of the kinks will bump the bottom of your foot. I would not buy it again, even for the low price charged by Amazon
I have been trying to suppress my appetite for awhile. I took TrimSpa 32 and I think that it did better than this product. I have been taking it for a week, and along with that, I have been substituting a nutrition shake for breakfast and a salad for lunch, plus working out. Dinners are healthy about 5 days out of the week.  I've noticed NO change.  I am taking these to be able to eat significantly less and still work out.  I'm very hungry before lunch and when I get home I have to take a nap and can't work out until later in the evening. I really have noticed no change at all in my appetite or my energy level, which is really unfortunate
THe pants that I ordered for my size were very small. They weren't true to size at all. I would not recommend this item to anyone
I've been making holiday turkeys for over 30 years.  This year for the first time I used Turkey Perfect...and without a doubt this was the best, moistest, most flavorful turkey I've ever done.  I told a friend about this product; she called me to rave about her absolutely delicious turkey.  Even relatives who don't really like turkey went back for seconds...and thirds...  For the first time ever we had NO turkey leftovers this year
Excellent! I am thrilled about finally finding coffee that smells and tastes just like what you can get at good hotels and brasseries in Europe. I was previously buying Lavazza's SuperCrema, in whole bean format, because I had tried it at one of my favorite Italian restaurants in Beverly Hills and thought it was great. However, it would not turn out the same using my semi-automatic home espresso machine and my low-end grinder. Therefore, for those who do not own $12,000 fully automatic commercial espresso machines like that restuarant did, this coffee is a much better choice. The Caffee Espresso comes in perfectly ground cans ready for the home Espresso machine. The Italians at Lavazza definitely know what they're doing! --- Definitely buy this coffee and enjoy
This item was the best product that I ever bought! It really works. To blend 2 colors you have to put the tips of the marker into the chamber and twist the markers. You can also mix 3 colors or 4 too. It's worth the price.
Very pleased with performance; have used it before without  problems
It is really good enough for my need. --- I have no problems so far
Ive always stayed away from the flip/slider phones because Im good at breaking things...Ive had this one for almost six months and its still going strong.  The mini sd port is awesome
A lot of work when into making this cloth, excellent for cleaning lenses of all kinds: glasses, video and digital cameras, etc. If you care about your lenses health, this is the cloth to buy, congrats 3M
This is good and healthy. It is not too sweat and not too healthy tasty. It is just perfect for me.
I bought this for my four year old for Christmas.  The net was broken on the second use when my four year old lightly banged it on our car bumper.  A week later, his friend, also four, broke one of the sticks when taking a shot with the feather-weight plastic puck that comes with the set.  Don't waste your money. Even for little kids it's probably worth it to just go ahead and buy real equipment that will last.
for me, Happy has a subtley orange undertone and evokes a sense of vibrancy and youth. As with the signature female clinique scents, you don't need much to cause a stir and it always leaves a lingering, subtle trail of sophistication
I ordered this piece and the matching chairs.  I have waited since July for them to be available.  They became availabe in September, so I ordered them.  They kept moving the delivery date and then canceled the chairs - said they couldn't get them.  So I  had to cancel the sofa as well. Now I am stuck with 2 chaise lounges and a coffee table but no other furnitue!!
My 8-year old wanted a pirate ship for Christmas, which was a dilemma because all I could find were ships for toddlers or LEGO-related ships.  This one is fully assembled (PHEW!) and when he opened the box, he jumped for joy.  The 4 action figures have the sinister look an 8-yr old could appreciate.  The cannon really shoots and the hoist loads and unloads treasures.  My son found enough small removable parts on the ship (a parrot, tools, anchor, lamps) to keep him occupied for hours.  The whole ship is hard or molded plastic, including the sails.  I'm fairly confident it will hold up in many future battles.  I'm VERY happy with this ship, but I wouldn't recommend it to a toddler or a child who looses small objects
First of all I would like to say that I was very reluctant to buy a SONY camera. After doing a lot of research for my needs I ended up with Canon 800IS and Sony's new toy T100. Ofcourse canon has the best overall ratings for ever but I wanted a stylish looking camera for my needs. Sony T100 is the best looking camera I have seen. It's features are awesome compared to it's small size. You can take it everywhere. Big bright screen on the back clearly visible in bright sunlight. It takes good indoor pictures too. I tried to play with its settings for while and thought that camera was not good. But then the best feature of the camera made it a winner for me. The auto mode takes great pictures and no need to set anything. Sometimes changing auto ISO helped to reduce the graniness but to be very honest if you are not going to blow the image to larger sizes (which would be 99% of the time atleast for me) it won't make difference. Just Point and Shoot. You get a perfect image for viewing on computers. No complaints apart from optional docking station which costs about $80. 5x optical zoom is boon to me as 3x was merely zoom. Also zomming while taking movies makes this a small camcoder with 640x480 30fps shooting. ---  --- It doesn't have touch screen like T50 and so it's responsiveness is better. I would like it bit faster though. Also camera takes pictures at very fast rate and the first picture you take is less than 2 secs. ---  --- I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who can afford it. ---  --- 
I bought this for myself to play with (I'm 35) and after all the presents were opened and toys, video games, and everything were forgotten (about 4 hours after Christmas), this was the ongoing favorite of the season.  Everybody, younger (down to 8) and older (to 45) had a blast with this thing after a couple minutes coaching. It's already on everybodys wish lists for upcoming birthdays and such.  This is a GREAT present for 11-18 boy. Fair warning though, there will be some good spills on the fairly short, steep learning curve - helmets, knee pads, blah, blah, are a must (and a video camera!
I did order half size up because of other reviews and the length is perfect.  However, the unisex width is way too wide for me.  I have a pair of Ugg men's Ultimate and they are not as wide.   ---  --- Overall, I still think Uggs are a little better and more comfortable
It's quite a bit slower than version 7.  But it looks really good and the form designer has been improved by leaps and bounds
Don't buy this here - it is selling for $49.99 at Best Buy (bestbuy.com). Wait until they lower the price on Amazon
  It is a very attractive wall clock that keeps accurate time. It is easy to  ---   view from a distant.  It also made the time adjustment for day light saving        ---   time
We had been looking for a light-weight backpacking tent with enough room for two. That seems simple enough, unless you've actually been inside of some of the "two-person" tents. Some of the expedition tents meet the size requirements, but are too heavy to be considered backpacking tents. We have just used this tent for the first time, and we are so far pleased. Plenty of room inside for two adults with large sleeping mats and sleeping bags, and a bit of gear. A large vesitibule on each side provides plenty of room for packs. I believe this will be a great warm-weather tent, with all of the mesh. The night we used it, it dropped below freezing. We woke to a ceiling (rainfly) covered in ice (on the inside). Didn't really expect that, with all of the ventilation, but as it was ice, it didn't drip on us. I'll chalk this experience up to extreme conditions until we use it in warmer weather. One thing that I don't like, although thus far it has not been an issue, is a seam running through the middle of the floor. It has been taped and sealed at the factory, but I just don't like the looks of it. I will seal it again before spring use, and edit this report, as we are sure to end up in a downpour here in south Texas. The tent is in fact lightweight and roomy, and so far, I am pleased. I will amend this report after having enountered weather with it
For a good price of approximate $4.50 (as I recall) plus shipping, I ordered the Bargaincell- Brand New Ikross Retractable car cigarette lighter adapter.   It did not work.   I suppose I could have packaged it up and sent it back (at a cost to me) and probably received a replacement. But for the cost of the unit, it was not worth my time. I've resorted to using a standard car recharger
I will keep this review simple. ---  --- For the price this is an ok deal. ---  --- However: --- The bag is a bit bulky and has no belt loop. --- The battery charger is finicky and has below average build quality --- Batteries are generic rechargeables. ---  --- You are better off finding a bag that fits your needs perfectly and picking up a separate charger/batteries. It will wind up costing you less in the long run
Way beyond my expectations.  Exceptionally fine cotton, changes colors in the light, great fit, absolutely beautiful--great delivery.  Thanks so much
I bought several things from this seller and this was among my favorites. My husband loved the way I looked in it. I must admit I was not that sure I wanted to buy something like this online...mainly because I am extremely picky with the quality of the things I buy...and also because I tend to be between sizes. But I ordered size 34 and looked perfect on me. I am very pleased with this seller. The order was shipped promptly and arrived in very good condition..
This soap works well for sensitive skin.  Smells like Olive Oil but hey that's why they named it olive oil soap. 
As always, the Nancy Drew games do not disappoint.  Personally, I quite enjoyed driving around delivering telegrams, if for no other reason than to keep my cash flow going, and to tour the rest of the town.  I must admit, I was a bit confused as to why HerInteractive wouldn't have incorporated the Courthouse into the game for some purpose, but hey, it's nice to see they have a penchant for detail.  After all, what town doesn't have a Courthouse? heh. ---  --- Indeed, this game could have been designed to be twice as enduring (and there were several ways this could have been accomplished), but to be honest, enduring does not equate with endearing.  Every ND game has satisfied me on many levels, even if a few levels were left wanting. ---  --- I also enjoyed going back in time to 1930, albeit there were a few inconsistencies regarding what took place when, i.e., the turntable revolving the wrong way, et al. ...however, a good detective will notice these faux pas. ---  --- Like I say, there's rarely any disappointment when it comes to the Nancy Drew games.  One can only hope they continue to create these games indefintely.  My only gripe is that they come out with only two games a year.  My wish would be for four or five. :
I like pasta. And tomatoes are used in the sauce I put on pasta. So I like tomatoes
I've allways got tired trying to wipe out all the dirt from road, birds and any other dificult thing you can imagine. But with the Lehm Klay ( I've also bought Lehm Lube) the dirt goes fast and easy... you just apply it and you have it. It's a Must hav
The manufacturer apparently states this case is compatible with the Panasonic FZ1 (and by extension the FZ3 which has an identical body).  I bought it and can report that it is not compatible with the FZ1.  With just the lens cap on you have to jam it into the bag sideways and then wrestle with the camera to get it back out.  If you prefer to use the camera with the lens hood adapter on the camera can't fit in the bag at all.  There's also no padding to speak of with this case.  By comparison my Lowe case for my Canon EOS Elan provides a secure, padded repository and you can put the camera in lens down with the strap on top so the camera can easily be withdrawn again.   ---  --- Targus makes decent laptop cases, but they have a great deal to learn about camera cases apparently.   ---  --- Apparently it does fit some cameras, just not the Panasonic FZs. ---  --- Considering the product is made in China one should be able to expect a bit more at this price
Recieved my Orange Monster Last September. I have worn it every day. I like the look and design of this watch but unfortunatly this watch does not keep very accurate time. Often losing about five minutes a week. I have friends who also own the Black Monster and anonther Orange monster and they have the same complaint.  ---  --- If I was to buy another watch I would not buy this Seiko again
Wow, I have absolutely no problems with this headset whatsoever. Clear sound-great range-and most of all its gorgeous. Turns heads all over the place. Man I feel high tech with this thing on. I payed $30.00 off of ebay, but that was a rare deal. Still Amazons price cannot be beat. Buy it, youll love it
I recently bought this wheel at a local Game Crazy in anticipation of the upcoming release of Gran Turismo 4 and so far despite a few problems i've been satisfied with my purchase. ---  --- The Good ---  --- 1. Great compatibility with PS2 racing titles - it works with basically all PS1 and PS2 racing games - not just Nascar games (I've been using it primarily with Gran Turismo 3) --- 2. Easy control customization. --- 3. Feels good in your hands --- 4. Well made ---  --- The Bad ---  --- 1. I wish the adjustable lap rest could lock into place (sometimes it slips back in when your taking a tough corner) --- 2. While the pedals are well made do not use them on a carpeted surface - they slip. (Customize the wheel like i did, setting the gas and brake to L1 and R1 and dont even bother with the pedels unless you have a better surface for them) --- 3. The wheel allows customization of it's sensitivity but i wish it could get a little more sensitive then it can (more life like) ---  --- Overall it's a good solid purchase if you can't afford to drop a 150 bucks on something top of the line. It's definately alot better then using a controller on a racing game.
This is a very mediocre Knights Kingdom set.  There's not much of interest going on here, and the small castle suffers from lazy design. ---  --- The colorful Knights Of Morcia are back, once again fighting against Vladek, the black knight.  Two of the good knights make an appearance here (blue and purple), and we also get Vladek, a dark soldier, and a skeleton.  The minifigs are as charismatic as ever, each sporting his own unique expression.  Vladek and his henchman have that cute "I'm evil" Lego frown.  Our knights are outfitted with the usual accessories.  Swords and shields, and a black hatchet for the henchman. ---  --- The scene is a small mountainside castle that is home to a large scorpion monster.  The creature is constructed from a mixture of regular and Technic parts, and he has hinged pieces for an articulated tail and pincers.  The blue knight is accompanied by his horse, who has a cute mini-catapult strapped to his side. ---  --- The scorpion can fit into his den at the base of the castle, which has a front gate that can be raised and lowered.  High atop the tower is a mini-catapult and a thin boom crane with a small barred jail cell dangling precariously from it.  The rest of the castle is just walls, floors, and a staircase.  This castle is very fragile.  Mine fell apart several times while I was working on building it.  On the whole, the design just isn't all that great.  Handle with care, and play with care.  Colors are mostly black, dark gray, dark red, and brown.  This set has one of those nice walls with the barred window, and some signature Knights Kingdom battlement pieces. ---  --- This set works as an addition to Vladek's Dark Fortress.  On its own, it's stunningly less impressive.  The good news is that a savvy Lego Maniac can take the castle parts and build a better castle with them. ---  --- My verdict:  one thumb up for the scorpion monster (who can be added to your other Knights Kingdom adventures), one thumb down for the rest.  Could've been better.  My advice is to get Vladek's Dark Fortress.  It's more than worth the price of admission.  For those still hungering for more Knights Kingdom action after Vladek's fortress has been built and conquered, this set is better than nothing
James, you wrote: "Ben is weak, immature, a stalker, lazy, has bad taste in women and at 21 is unable to tell his parents no when they ask him to wear a scuba suit for their family friends. Wow! Revolutionary film-making...not!"   Yes, Ben was weak, immature, and had bad taste in women. His learning to overcome his weakness, immaturity, bad taste in women, and then defy his family and Elaine's family was his coming of age story.  That WAS the point of the movie.  It went right over your head!  The acting was dead on and the subject matter was shocker when it came out!  How could you not love this movie?  Maybe you need to grow up a little to see the value.  Watch it again in a few years.  I think you will change your low opinion of this great classic movie over time.     
but leaves a lot to be desired in practice.  Just get a small electric or hand crank food processor.  This is not worth your time
Although a few of the tracks seem inspired, it's mainly Mulligan going through the motions with Getz, with very little chemistry between them.  "Anything Goes" and "Scrapple From the Apple" are nice  enough but beyond that it's weak.  Mulligan himself didn't speak very  highly of the recording session, saying that he enjoyed his other dates  with Desmond, Webster, and Hodges, but mentioning that "Granz wanted  that session a lot more than I did."  Of course, it would be quite out  of the ordinary to hear anything but negative remarks about Stan Getz and  his sparkling personality.   Save your money and go buy the 2-disk reissue  of "Meets Ben Webster".  Or, if you don't have it already, the  seminal Pacific recordings with Chet Baker
I am not Jewish, but you don't have to be to enjoy these songs. This album happens to be one of my favourites of the Putumayo releases. A couple of the songs were instantly familiar to me even though I thought I knew none of the songs when I bought this album. Each and every song on here is wonderful...some are traditional folk songs while others are newer compositions. The 23 page booklet includes a 3 page history of Jewish music, and each artist has a page about them, including a photograph. I highly recommend this album to just about everyone. My husband is Arabic and he too loves these songs. Music truly is borderless
The pendant is striking, shiny, and great to look at.  The diameter of the pendant is the size that I expected and the necklace itself is adjustable so you can choose how high or low you want to wear it.  Great purchase, would buy it again
I took the TV out of the box, plugged it in and nothing.  After pushing the on/off switch repeatedly, it finally came on.  Picture and sound were terrific so I was very pleased.  Turned it off with the remote.  Of course, the TV wouldn't turn on again with either the remote or the switch.  Pushed the switch about 10 times and it finally came on.  I called Panasonic customer service who could not do anything to fix it by phone.  So now my new TV is in for a warranty repair less than 24 hours after I received it.  Talk about frustrating!!
I have tried many different sports bras and this one is truly wonderful
These are the best tasting lollipops you will ever have.  Because of my 2 year olds food allergies I discovered these and now her doctors office is purchasing them, even the hospital my husband works at.  These are allergy free and amazing!!!!!!!!
the kid who wrote the 5 star reveiw is wrong. he needs to go to preschool. first, the pagages arent free, if they didnt come w/the maker no one would buy it. second, this kid says it cant get any better, but it cant get any worse!!!! the 1 star reveiws say to go to mc donalds if you want a mc flurry, but dont go there and support them thats just what they want you to do so they can earn more money!! go to DQ or just make one yourself. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PEICE OF JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
While the flavor is unique, three of the five packets of nuts were rancid! To say I am disappointed is an understatement. Unfortunately, this is not the first time I have had problems with the freshness of food products purchased from Amazon.  ---  --- Now, one to the two non-rancid packets. I got through one in a few days, and I was working on the other ... them I realized I had a major head-fog, you know, like a hangover, but without having had anything to drink. I gave up the nuts & it went away. For me, that's a tell-tale sign of additives in food. Not a good choice for someone with chemical sensitivities.   ---  --- I purchased this on a SD recommendation. But it was a complete & utter waste of money for me. 
The boot is beautiful, but because my feet are wide they are uncomfortable to break in. The price is reasonable.  Hope to wear soon
I HAVE HAD THIS MOTOROLA V171 FOR A YEAR NOW AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. THE FEATURES ARE SO EASY TO UNDERSTAND. THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPS FOR NET 10 WIRELESS ARE VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND. THIS PHONE IS A NET 10 WIRELESS PHONE. NET 10 WIRELESS IS A SUBSIDIARY OF TRACFONE.  I WOULD THIS PHONE TO ANYBODY LOOKING FOR A PREPAID CELL PHONE PLAN. I LOVE IT BECAUSE ONLY FOR A LIMITED TIME YOU GET 300 MINUTES FREE UPON ACTIVATION OF YOUR PHONE. I WOULD ALSO STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT IF ANYBODY PURCHASES THIS MOTOROLA ACTIVATE IT ON [...] ITS A WHOLE LOT EASIER THAN CALLING
***** --- This Bedtime Tea from Yogi Tea is an caffeine-free herbal tea that is relaxing and a natural sleep aid. Bedtime Tea is made from organic licorice root, organic spearmint leaf, organic chamomile flower, organic skullcap leaf, organic cardamom seed, organic cinnamon bark, organic St. John's Wort leaf & flower, organic rose hips, natural orange flavor, valerian root extract, organic raspberry leaf, organic English lavender flower, stevia leaf, and passion flower extract. The taste is mild, delicious, herb-y, and very slightly sweet. It is subtle and lovely. ---  --- I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Bedtime Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make. ---  --- There is a warning on the box that this tea is not to be used during pregnancy or while nursing. If you are taking MAO inhibitors or other prescription drugs, you should consult your physician or health care professional before use. There are no other cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. ---  --- Best of all, it works...I love drinking it before bed to relax and drift off into blissful sleep. This is a great tea that I highly recommend. --- ****
I tried to use these to relieve the pain but they did not work for me. They were hot and of course they also showed right through any top I was wearing. I had too much company after having my baby to use these they required too much work and attention
Barry Levinson's Diner is a rich panoramic snapshot of a time, people and place that's treasured by those of us who lived through that period and had paralell experiences. He's a master of his craft and so are all that contributed to this work
She is so cute! I love the real hair, I've made loads of crazy designs. Also, I made a discovery, if you squeeze her tummy, she cries, falls asleep or says "I luv you mama"
Huge problems with the LCD screen, two cameras within one month after purchase showed the LCD "shattered." One has already been shipped for service and the other one will be going in tomorrow.  Sure it is easy to use and produces great pictures, but the LCD problem is a definite negative.
When I bought this, the other review wasn't posted yet. Now, please benefit from our two reviews. This thing is a total joke. Useless, too small (I have larger hotel samples). I too would like to return this, but I just don't have time before Christmas. Amazon should NOT offer this item. It is a complete let down, over priced and just a joke. No fooling
The product does everything they claim save one. It won't work inside  Windows XP (service pack 2). But it will work when you boot from the disk. That isn't a problem in my view. Therefore I have no complaints
I keep this frame on all day and night. The LCD backlight should last longer than 4 months but mine just burned out. --- The quality of the pictures are okay if viewed from a distance but the low res. is not good if viewing up close. ---  --- There is no external power controls or a remote so turning this unit on and off is a drag. Regular LCD backlights should last a few years even if it stays on all day and night. This one just lasted 4 months. So the image is almost non-existant now. In the glare, you can barely make out the image so it's still there but with no backlight so good as dead. ---  --- I would recommend a more expensive Philips ones. My friend has had it for about two years and it's still going. plus it's higher res and and has more controls such as a timer function and also can play video clips, which this one can't
The earrings arrived in a Jewelery box, so they would make a nice gift.  The earrings seem to be well made.  The post has a notch  to prevent loss of the back.  The ameythyst stone is so pretty---I've gotten a number of compliments on these earrings
We have in the past owned an In Step single jogger.  It wasn't perfect but it certainly met our needs.  It always needed to be tipped back to change direction and it rusted a little because we left it outside.  If we had stayed as an only child family it would have continued working but with the addition of another baby we decided to sell it.  After being in transition for over a year and now that the weather is warming up we decided to get a double jogger for strolling.  We purchased the In Step Run Around LTD 2 Jogging Stroller in hopes it would meet our new needs.  The problems of the single stroller seemed compounded in the double stroller.  My husband had no problem getting it together but complained about the cheap caliper style break... it doesn't stop the stroller and barely even slows it down.  It took him the same amount of time to work on the break as it took him to assemble the whole jogger.  After that we placed our three year old and our 18 month old in it for a test ride.  When placing them in we encountered our next problem... the seats even at the highest point are super reclined.  They wanted no part of laying back but instead were both utterly thrilled to sit far forward and mess with each other. As for the straps a six inch long safety label sewn to the webbing made it almost impossible to thread them through the front buckle. So off we set on our test drive.  It was really hard to push and almost impossible to turn.  After a while we figured out that letting the kids sit so far forward threw off the balance of the whole jogger.  The only way to make it partially work was to let out both seats to the fully reclined position, criss-cross the shoulder straps and constantly yell "Stay down kids...if you sit up one more time I'm going to sit in it and make you push me!"  Well we got home from our test run and my husband pulled out the cardboard box and with a resigned air began the job of taking it apart.  I don't recommend this item.  In all honesty our Radio Flyer Pathfinder Wagon does the job more effectivel
I've been using SpySweeper for 2 years now.  It generally does what it is supposed to do.  However, it was nearing time for me to renew.  SpySweeper becomes a huge, irritating nag when it comes time to renew.  Not only does the software bug you all the time, but Webroot sends out reminder e-mails too.  With 3 weeks left on my subscription, I decided to renew, mostly just to get rid of all the nagging.  Well, guess what? - the renewal process reset my expiration date.  Rather than giving me 3 weeks plus 1 year, the renewal starts immediately, and ends in exactly 1 year - which means, that I've been ripped off for 3 weeks of paid subscription.  Maybe Webroot thinks their users are too stupid to notice this deceptive practice of moving up renewal dates.  I've complained to them - and if they don't make amends, then I cannot recommend this product to anyone
My daughter loves this earring 'tree'. It looks great and is very practical as it holds multiple earrings
I just received two of these bra-less nursing nightgowns (sm), a robe (sm/m), and the two piece tank pj set (sm).  I'm almost nine months pregnant and have gained 50ish pounds and despite the other review about not fitting during pregnancy, it (and the other items) fits and stretches well while holding its shape.  I will wear this now and indefinitely after the baby comes: it's apparent that it will fit me well after baby too. --- The quality of the fabric is substantial enough to hold large (and engorging) breasts without the need for a bra.  It is strong but breathable, and not flimsy so it slightly smoothes out quirks of the pregnant body. --- The length is a little longer than most - it slightly covers my knees -  which is what I wanted so slit is nice to have for normal strides walking, easing out of bed, hiking up to use the washroom, etc. without tearing the seams.  --- As the description and the other review indicates, the cups can slide down for pumping or nursing. --- I'm very happy with the colors, design, and construction of all items.  Due to the volume of my order (directly from the [...] site, I received a high quality FREE minky dot chenille blanket that came rolled and ribboned in a nice tulle bag.  I would definitely get this for other expectant or new moms
i am very pleased with my purchase .The item came to me in 3 days via dhl in a new condition well packed and safe .Recomended for reasonable prices .
This is a great shaver.  If you are in the market for one, considered the Remington R-960.  I am of Afro-American descent and was very skeptical about buying a rotary we shaver.  I had always gotten excellent results using Remington shavers that were of the micro thin type to tackle the tough turf around my mug.  With its ergonomic design, it was very easy to manipulate the shaver around in tough areas.  I had considered purchasing that of another brand until I discovered that Remington makes one and now... I'm loving it
Ha ha ha hah ha hah!  That's Stirling laughing all the way to the bank.  Or at least I hope that's what he is doing.  But sadly I suspect he more likely feels his Wiccan/SCA/DnD-infused vision of a post-apocalyptic society is a reasonable, nay, likely path we'll follow should selective physical laws break down.  Quick!  Stop me!  I feel the need to wave my sword, sing a Gaelic song, and break out my cauldron!  The genre requires we make a leap of faith.  And as a fan of the genre, I do so willingly.  But having made the leap, it is annoying at best to be forced through this "Tolkein as faith" drivel.  But as I will likely read the entire series (remember, I love the genre) I have to hope that Stirling leans towards the "thanks for the buck buddy" and is himself laughing at us all.  But a picture is worth a thousand words and his mug on the inside cover tells me he believes this nonsense! ---  --- My recommendation?  Read the book.  Laugh a bit.  Maybe laugh a lot. But do this with the library's copy, not one you paid for
I've run my Panasonic KP-4A sharpener for nearly a decade, with nary a hitch. It chisels keen points quickly, with a little accompanying noise that wouldn't be disturbing in most situations. In fact, the pitch tells you when the sharpening is achieved. Seems unbreakable to me, as long as one does not force pencils downward--just hold them steady and in 5 seconds, the job's done. Its sleek, compact, cordless design works on any desktop
Product arrived as expected.  I've had the tooth brush for about a year now and I love it.  One complain I have is that the interior of the brush head can get pretty dirty.  It cleans up pretty well with a soak in warm water and bleach.  I have not tried soaking it in Oxyclean, that might work even better. 
Hey, BRRRRRUUUUUCCCE! ---  --- What's the deal? Just about every major Top 40 artist has had their catalogs sonically updated EXCEPT YOURS. ---  --- Why can we buy the "Tracks" editions, and get glorious HDCD-encoded sound, but "Town" sounds like it's coming out an AM radio? ---  --- OK, you did your best, but Dubya's back in the White House for the next four years, and Kerry's home in his underwear watching the Weather Channel. You should have plenty of time on your hands now... GET BUSY! ---  --- Let's see some remastering!
Since I also have a two year old, it has been so great to have this wrap.  I can go to the park with him and not have to leave the baby in a stoller and I can keep my hands free.  The best part is that my baby falls asleep in the wrap usually within five minutes.  If he is fussy and I don't really know why, it is so easy to put him in here and take the kids for a walk.  The only drawback is that it is a bit comebersome, so I wouldn't use it if I was only going to have it on for a few minutes.  This is such a great way to get the things done that you need to do while still staying close to your baby.  And the wide straps keep it from hurting my back at all
This is absolutely the best bottle on the market. After working in daycare and as a nanny, I had a preference for these.  Then after my sister had my nephew and used them I knew the minute I found out I was expecting that I would be using them too.   ---  --- The reason that I love these bottles so much is that they are very easy for baby to latch onto.  Most other bottles use very small nipples whereas these use a nipple that is quite large, more like a breast.  If you think about how a woman's body is made and really look at the nipples you will see what I mean.  Being able to latch on better allows them to eat better and have much less gas and spit up. ---  --- I also love how easy they are to warm up in a bottle warmer or crock pot.  Because they use the liner, the milk can heat up much quicker than a standard bottle with thick plastic - a very important thought at 3AM!!! ---  --- Some people think having to always by liners is costly an annoying.  But not really.  100 eight ounce liners will cost about $8 and will last about 2 to 2 1/2 weeks.  So not as bad as you might think.  (If this is truly an issue for you, consider the Advent bottles.  They also have relatively large nipples.  But because they do not use a liner, you cannot eliminate the air from the bottle and they take much longer to warm up.)  ---  --- 
This bag is very small. My Canon 20D fits nicely with a small lens, but you cannot fit more than one lens with the camera body. We kept the bag for informal use when we only need the body and one lens to avoid always having to carry a bulky bag
I have used both Paperport 8 and Paperport 9 Deluxe for over a year so I am qualified to report. ---  --- Both pieces of software have some form of severe incompatibility with Windows XP Pro.   ---  --- I cannot really get version 9 to operate.  Everytime I try its like cold molasses.  Click...wait....wait....wait...wait...and then lock up. ---  --- I'm very experienced.  I've been working with PCs since 1991.  Every other piece of software I've loaded works very well...except for Paperport 8 and 9. ---  --- In theory Paperport 9 should be fine because it converts all scans to PDF which is more or less a universal file format.  However theory is a lot better than reality. ---  --- Support is nonexistent from ScanSoft.  If you pay the $19.95 per incident, you still do not get a solution. ---  --- The ScanSoft forum is always either not working (another bad sign) or it's full of people complaining about the software and lack of support. ---  --- Unfortunately there are not a lot of alternatives, but doQments looks promising. ---  --- Avoid Paperport unless you have money and time to waste
hey, ---  --- I have been using Min shampoo on/off for about six months, and can no longer go off the stuff because when I do there is  dramtic difference. As far as the smell goes, I don't need to smell like a coconut or a Bloomingsdale, just make it pleasant or oderless and give texture and fullness to my hair. I don't think it smells medicated, (unlike reviogen) but just doesn't have too strong of an oder. If more people knew of this product more people would be happier with their hair.
This lens does ok at magnifying about 2x max.  On full zoom, the magnification was not as sharp as without the close-up lens
I recently ordered a Kodak camera from Amazon.com. With that I also ordered this battery & the camera bag. Everything was delivered as expected, EXCEPT the camera. Over 2 weeks later I was notified the camera is not available. Now I'm stuck with a battery & camera bag that I can't return because they came from another seller. The camera I bought from a different seller came with the bag & uses a different battery. Now I'm out the cost of the battery, the bag & the shipping charges! Thanks a lot
We looked at many TV stands to go with the Sony TV we were buying.  Only a few were worth considering, but finally decided to go with the Sony unit designed for our specific TV.  Am I glad we did!  It has hold downs to secure the TV and the cable straps at the rear are easy to use and make the installation clean and clear.  Very nicely designed, along with being good looking
My son received this as a christmas gift, and thoroughly enjoys it. This is not a regular DVD. It is designed to go with the "Read With Me DVD" system (a separate remote control that works with it on your TV). A previous reviewer was not aware of this, so it should not have received a bad review for consumer error
I absolutely adore Elle Decoration - as several other reviewers have noted, unfortunately, the American version can't compare.  The spaces are gorgeous, and infinitely more imaginative and vivacious.  All of my American magazines (with the exception of Interior Design) get ripped apart, with a few pages pulled out and the rest tossed - Elle Decoration always gets saved in its entirety. I highly recommend - these magazines are eye candy, and they are truly worth the extra cost of an import.
I have been using this for my face for over 10 years.  It is very inexpensive (especially compared to other cosmetic brands) and cleans well without irritating or drying the skin.  I also used it on my 3 kids.  It comes in handy on the changing table, especially when the wipes were not quite "wet" enough to do the job!  It is also great for any spot cleaning anywhere on the body without rinsing.  It can just be wiped off without leaving any residue.  It is very gentle, even for newborn's skin
I really enjoyed this movie however one of the more interesting parts of the movie was not fully developed.  Ian Mckellen's character was supposed to be homosexual .....he is in love with Vincent Perez's character.  It was a pretty subtle subplot in the movie and while I was watching it I was thinking....hmmmm is Ian Mckellen's character gay? I read Roger Ebert's review of the movie on [...]. In his article Ebert says the movie could have been more interesting if this plot was further developed....I agree. I really enjoyed the movie but I thought Ian Mckellen's character was very interesting and if his desires were further explored it could have turned this fairly ordinary romance movie into an extraordinary movie
Hi, I just wanted to let everyone out their know: that this stuff works.  ---  --- I have had problematic hormonal acne since the age of 21. I'm 27 now.  ---  --- After I graduated from the university and started working a real job, the stress went straight to my face (you all know what I am talking about). Unfortunately for me, I am allergic to benzyl peroxide and I have extremely sensitive skin. I also do not do well with tea tree oils and most sulfur and acidic products (basically anything that can kill acne - leaves my face itchy- either swollen like a tomato or is ineffective and I have painful acne bumps...which would you rather do?). ---  --- I was a little hesitant after reading the ingredients and noticed that the cleanser had sulfur in it and there was also a jar of pure salicylic acid for blemishes. But, after using other philosophy products for my hair and body - I decided to give it a try. Hell, what's another 50 bucks if it can clear my acne - and if not I can always send it back. ---  --- I started using it about 3 weeks ago and my skin has had a tremendous transformation. I finally feel like my acne is under control. I recommend this product fully and it is my duty to tell everyone this after suffering with relentless acne for so many years.  ---  --- The cleanser is awesome and needs to be in a larger size. The blemish serum is extremely drying, so if you are sensitive like me read the directions and take it slow - don't reapply throughout the day, until your skin is ready. The day and night face creams are cool. The day one is kind of like glue and seals in the treatment - the entire day! That's why it works, because it is on your face until night time when you wash (I can even faintly smell the product). Then you use your night hydrogen peroxide cream, yes not benzyl. Yeah, this cream is intense as well. So take it slow until your skin is ready.  ---  --- One thing that I do recommend is that if you wear make-up, use the purity cleanser (not in the kit) to initially clean your skin and then use the acne cleanser. That's what I do and it works for me - so I will share it with you. ---  --- Another thing I do is I will take a little bit of the hope is not enough SPF moisturizer and put on very little on my super dry areas. Remember this acne kit is intense and you may be prone to drying out and peeling - so some oil-free moisturizer can help hydrate the area around the acne. ---  --- Well that's about it. I hope this helps you and let's you know that your acne can be tamed and doesn't have to run your life.  ---  --- Take care, --- M. Rodriguez --- Surprise, AZ ---  ---  
This is actually a review for more than one product (Pimsleur and Rosetta Stone) ---  --- If you are willing to spend 1-2 years learning a foreign language but have limited time (weekly), lack the ability to immerse yourself in that culture for 1 year (the best way to learn the language), can't attend classes, can expend some budget, and want the process to be challenging yet fun, here's how to do it: ---  --- 1. Buy a good English-Foreign Language Dictionary. --- 2. Get the Pimsleur Course for that language. (Check Ebay for used copies) --- 3. Buy the Rosetta Stone Program for that language. (Costly. Try the online monthly subscription option if your budget is tight.) --- 4. Get a Basic Grammar Language Book (Barron's highly recommended) ---  --- Putting it all together. ---  --- 1. Listen to the Pimsleur Program during your daily commute-1 lesson per day. (Take the weekend off) DO NOT go to the next lesson until you have a 80% recall of the material. THERE IS NO NEED TO BE AT 100% RECALL before going to the next lesson. (Trust me on this on-avoid my pain) ---       Using this method, you can get through ALL Pimsleur lessons (Levels I-III)in 1 year. THE FOCUS OF PIMSLEUR IS SPEAKING SKILLS. ---  --- 2. At the same time, use the Rosetta Stone lessons on the weekend, with one 30 minute to 1 hour session. Go through the guided exercise followed by the test. THERE IS NO NEED TO GO THROUGH EVERY LESSON (TYPE) for each program. After you buy the product, you'll know what I'm talking about. THE FOCUS OF ROSETTA STONE IS LISTENING SKILLS.   ---  --- 3. Review the basic grammar of the language as you go through the 2 above. ---  --- 4. Contrary to what Pimsleur says, look up any words for spelling, and likewise, for Rosetta Stone, look up any words for definition you don't understand.  ---  --- Bottomline: Despite what they advertise, these are not stand-alone programs. Also the secret to recall is anticipation, meaning an 80% success rate for Pimsleur is ok and 70% success rate for Rosetta Stone is okay before moving to the next lesson.  ---  --- You don't get any extra points for making 100% and this effort can be counter-productive (burn out, boredom, and frustration before finishing the lessons.) ---  --- Your goal should be to get through all of the programs and lessons and the experience should be challenging and fun. Afterwards, you can take your trip to that country for the total immersion experience, and after the first 2 weeks, you'll see how well spent your time was with the programs.   ---  --- Note: I've used the Japanese, German, and Korean Pimsleur Courses, and Rosetta Stone German and Japanese Programs. I've also spent extensive time in all 3 of those countries. Learn from my mistakes. ---  --- Good luck and have fun.
What a wonderful game - addictive and motivating! If you want to be able to make original sentences, you might need something more in depth with a bit more grammar, but for "Eazy Speak" this is right on the target! Fun for any computer user! ---  --- Looking for Spanish curriculum for younger kids? Try Flip Flop Spanish which has a CD with the writable workbook
The gym is very easy to assemble, took me about 45 minutes on my own.  The book supplies several different workouts, hitting every major muscle group, and you get good resistance in every workout. You won't get great range of motion on all the workouts, there may be times when you'll need to lean back or put yourself in a different position in order to get a full stretch, but those are minor adjustments you'd probably have to make on any other type of equipment.  The gym itself is light, easy to move around the house, and doesn't take up much space. It may be too light, and not sturdy enough in some instances, and you will need to stand on the frame in the stand-up workouts.  --- The price is outstanding, at 180 dollars. You're not going to find a better deal than this, and the workout is very comparable to the far more expensive Bowflex
I used to like good charlotte, enough that i bought this CD, but i really don't like them at all anymore.  They try to look all punk, but they are pop.  They whine a lot.  I think it's time to get over the fact that their dad left and they were uncool.  they should at least stop doing songs about it.  They have some ok melodies and words, but for the most part all their songs sound the same.  Good Charlottes first two CD's were almost good, but this one is bad and really whiny
It was a gift and I was pleased with the good quality and workmanship
The code reader is a very good device with an excellent price. I fix my car and I saved money. The diagnostic for a car is almost 80 dollars in the auto repair shop, with that money I bought my own code reader
When I first got this camera, I was satisfied.  It is complicated to use (definitely not intuitive) because it does so much with so few buttons that you need to scroll through endless screens at time sto do what you want.  However, it took pretty good pictures.  However, soon after the warranty expired, it began to overexpose pictures and we couldn't stop it from doing that.  We tried to contact Fuji but have gotten no response.  My wife found that this is a common problem (overeposure and lack of response from Fuji), which is probably why they have a lot of refurbished ones to sell.  Hopefully, they have fixed the problem but I wouldn't bet my money on it.  This camera has given us more frustration than it is worth
The best part about my ijoy 130 is the price I paid.  Day after Xmas Linens and Things had only the floor model left.  Got 20% off of that plus signed up for the credit card to get another 10% off.  30% off made the chair $500 instead of $700.  I am in it as I write this!!!  Very nice and relaxing.  Sometimes the "percussion" setting is a little too hard in some spots but otherwise it's great.  I would agree that I wish it went a little further up the neck.  I just sit a little lower in the chair for it.  Not sure if it's worth $700 just because that's alot of money but I've got no problem with $500.  I think my wife and I will get alot of use out of it
The software is terrible, slow and glitchy. I have to start and close it multiple times to get it to find the player. The operators manual is just under 100 pages, so have fun learning the intricacies of the controls. Granted, the hardware is cute and the variety of functions is impressive--assuming you have sufficient spare time to study the manual.
Don't listen to the reviews that claim that this lens is not a good choice for cropped sensor cameras (IE the 20D, 30D, Rebels etc) the Canon L lens are the best and this particular lens is no exception. I have had the lens for less than 24 hours now and am in love with the sharpness and color already.  ---  --- Great lens, great color, so well built, super sharp, just watch out if this is your first L lens, you'll be hooked. ---  --- This is a lens you will have for many years, great investment
This is one of the truly great Handel opera recordings of the last twenty years. As usual, Nicholas McGegan proves himself to be one of the two or three greatest Handelian conductors of our time. The singing from beginning to end is first class. This opera is known for the famous largo "Ombra mai fu," but the music in this entire performance is a sheer delight
 --- Fast and easy to make, delicious to eat, and no sugar or fat !  Buying in quantity is economical and efficient
My family always enjoys Mini Wheats and this shipment was no exception. Everything was just as tasty as store-bought. I have recommended Amazon to family and friends. When I had a question, Amazon was right there to solve the problem.
Well I guess the title says most of it. I am not happy with them they turn a dark brown just walking across the yard so I have to put them in the washing machine with bleach A LOT. Then the place where the laces go at the top are all frayed. I've tried to was them by hand with bleach so it wont fry but it dosen't work they look the same as before. But they are comfortable I also like the high arch in them. They are pretty when they fist come out of the box but if you are planing on doing any outdoor actives I wouldn't recommend them
I came across this looking for angel pendants.  I bought this one and the matching earrings.  I absolutely love this pendant! Wear it all the time and always get compliments on it.  You can wear it year round! One of the earrings fell out of my ear the first time I wore it!  Wouldn't recommend those! But this winged pendants is beautiful
This is a heavy/thick robe, I expect it would fit a man 6' tall perfectly. I am 5'8" and the sleeves are only slightly to long but, I don't even notice now. The comfort level is amazing, this is so incredibly soft and warm you will put it on as soon as you get home and take it off when you go to bed. I cant speak on durability as I've only had it for a month or so but, you most likely will not be dissapointed with the feel. I got the brown color and I love it, I feel like grisly adams in this thing..
This necklace is beautiful.  The chain is not skimpy and the heart locket itself is really pretty.  A great alternative to an expensive locket at a fine jeweler.  A true steal at a sale price of under $30.00
This morning I spilled coffee on my "million dollar" white dress shirt.  It left me with three large coffer stains.  I remembered that I had my Tide To Go in the car.  After drenching the stains with the solution and rubbing them per the directions, most of the coffee stains had disappeared....what remained, however, were large coffee colored rings at the edges of where the solution had spread.  So, most of the coffee stain was gone, but I'm left with the unsightly rings...not quite as noticeable, but there're still there. ---  ---  ---  --- 
I am sooooo very happy that agave is now available in the large container.  This brand is the best of the agave. --- 
This product is great! Very refreshing. It tastes just like you are drinking it straight from a young coconut.  It doesn't have any added sugar & it's only 60 calories a serving.  I just wish it were cheaper...
Needs more shoulder buttons.  Other than that, is good
Was surprised by the price compared to other movies, but it was worth it
I was impatient to buy the successor of my beloved Treo 650, and did so last January by upgrading to the Treo 680. I have been a faithful customer of Palm technology since 1997, and for the first time, I am disappointed. Of course, I still have the friendly Palm OS, tailor made for smart phones. I also have upgrade compatibility for my 15,000 records stored in the Treo's four main applications. But the minuscule battery of the 680 forces me to curtail Versamail sync and phone conversations, and its clumsy command bar results in unexpected commands (contrary to the 650, buttons are too close to each other). Reliability of the 680 is also left to be desired, especially compared with the 650 after firmware update. Finally, I use Intellisync for dual sync with both user-friendly Palm Desktop and heavy duty email MS Outlook; the acquisition of Pumatech by Nokia results in a clumsy new release of Intellisync for Treo: Intellisync new version added a record number in the "note" field of all my records ! I quickly reverted to an older Intellisync version and I wonder what will happen when I need to upgrade with  MS Office 2007 compatibility... Nokia's low blow to Palm ? It is time Palm responds with a decent dual sync solution of their own. If not, it's decided: I will switch to the Pearl
As a complete newbie to XML this was a good starter.  As I got deeper into XML I found several mistakes/deficiencies in the book, and sometimes the author just flat out seemed to not know what he was talking about.  For instance, the claim on page 86 that (#CDATA) is a valid DTD element content definition is flat out wrong.  His description of Schema element declarations (pp. 114-115) teaches that using globals/refs is the only way to define complex elements, and is inappropriate for his example.  He makes no mention of globals at all, leaving the reader confused.  I have ceased to trust this book as a valid source of XML information
It seems that all previous Quickbook versions will not run on Windows Vista and I had upgraded my system. So, I bought Simple Start as the least expensive way to get a Quickbook product to run on Vista. Turns out Simple start runs fine on Vista BUT you cannot load a company file from earlier versions. Thus, Simple Start was simply useless to me. When I called Intuit customer service they said that for another $100 they'd give me a license number that would unlock that feature. By that time I was committed and had no choice. Talk about getting ripped off!!
As a novice astronomer I really enjoy the sharp, steady view with these binoculars. The view is fairly steady even with the I.S. off - depending how stable you are of course. My binoculars cost more than my telescope !! And my telescope is a decent one too. But I think they are worth it. You see so much more in the night sky than what the naked eye can see - by far. They are of course great during the day too. Their weight is not much of an issue for me, although each person is different depending on their viewing habits. I think a hard carry case would have been the best but it's not a big deal for my use. I recommend this pair of binoculars to anyone who is serious about great quality and performance
I use it with my Nikon D70, and am very satisfied with it. --- I most often use it for long exposures, for taking picture that include myself, and for taking pictures of my 6-month old daughter, who stops acting naturally when she notices I hold the camera, so I place it on the tripod, and take pictures of her.
This is perfect for the desktop.  It excels at destroying credit cards, DVDs, CDs and Floppy Disc.  In an emergency you can use it to shred paper, including staples. ---  --- Because DVDs, CDs and Floppy Disc are dense, they lay flat, and take up very little room in the debris basket.  Since paper is light, it will bunch up, filling the debris basket fast.  If you do a lot of paper, you want to consider a paper shredder with a larger basket. ---  --- Because it is shredding polycarbonate and metal, the feeder slot snuggly fits DVDs, CDs, and Floppy Discs.  This reduces the chance of high energy debris.  Do Not look into the slot while shredding.  Because of the snug slot, feeding paper into the MD100 is not quick.  If you want to shred less than 8 pages, but cannot leave your desk, you can use the MD100.  If you want to shred more than 8 pages, or can leave you desk, it is better to use a paper shredder with a larger feed slot and a larger basket. ---  --- This is also a personal shredder, if you need to shred from more than two minutes at a time (approximately 24 DVDs or CDs or Floppy Discs), you should get a commercial grade machine
i got to get it off my chest.  this camera takes great photos and they print out wonderful.  BUT, the camera has several down sides:   1. as all have said, it eats batteries big time.  this is a pain.  2. it recharges slow between flash and between non flash.  forget about catching a great spontaneous moment.   3. not durable.  i dropped mine out of the case from below waist hight and it does nto work at ALL.  i am sure by the time i send it in and pay for shipping and repair i can buy a new one that is cheaper and more reliable.  any suggestions???
Ch.9 - Heated Moments - graphic details of a girl starting her period. Writing makes it seem that a girl's period is something wrong
The picture is good and the combo was convenient.  However, after 1 year, the DVD broke.  Now I have just a TV.  This is the problem with combos.  It is better to get components separately
This item is more of a foot and ankle massager if you have long legs.  I am tall with a 37" inseam.  This item is not made for someone who has longer than "average" legs unless you're looking for a foot and ankle massage rather than a calf massage. 
It was really cute when I got it.  Two days later, the color started chipping away. The stones started falling off as well. I was so disappointed when it happened since it looked so nice when I got it. I do not recommend buying it.
That's the drawback of buying a new thing on the internet because you can not feel or smell it. I bought the whole set as I am a sandalwood fanatic. i couldn't have been more disappointed, this thing whatever it is does not smell like sandalwood. a complete waste of money
The book uses cartoons to emphasize the text. It's always interesting to see what common words different cultures use to describe the human condition.  Wastes a lot of space, though.  Worth the price
Okay, after reading several reviews, I decided to buy this anyway for a few laughs.  Boy did I get my moneys worth!  It was so incredibly BAD that I was first cringing in horror before I started laughing.  The characters, especially Hiei, were so screwed up and the voice dubbing was so unfamiliar that in the end it had me laughing.   ---  --- Now, I'm a die hard yyh fan, but I give it high marks just because it was so much fun to watch.  Put me in a good mood for the rest of the day.  If you arent pressed for cash and up for a few laughs i'd definitely suggest  buying for th he11 of it
Atomic watches are highly-accurate quartz watches which are synchronized each day with a time signal broadcast from the definitive U.S. Atomic Clock in Ft. Collins, Colorado. Thus, all atomic watches are always accurate to within a fraction of a second at any time. Since atomic watches adjust automaticaly to and from daylight saving time they are the ultimate in accurate watches. Casio makes -- and Amazon sells -- a wide selection of styles of atomic watches to suit various needs and tastes, but all are equally accurate. The Casio G-Shock series is especially rugged and the solar powered models, such as this, never require battery replacement. Atomic accurary, solar power, and G-Shock ruggedness is an appealing combination at a quite reasonable price
My 21 month old toddler loved the star crayon, and so did I initially.  However, during its first use the red crayon fell out of the plastic holder.  The problem is the shape of the crayon is like a round piece of candy.  My son picked it up and was about to put it in his mouth when I saw what had happened.  Personally, I would not use the product given the choking hazard that it presented.  Otherwise, I would use it with care and watch your child carefully as they play with the product. 
My wife and I love this product.  Now, it's not for backpacking, but it does work great as a car camping or base camp stove.  It does require one of those disposable propane tanks (which can be tough to dispose of), and it might make sense to get the carrying case (not seeing it attached here).  But besides that, a great, simple stove which can be used in all kinds of conditions
This is a terrific tour of Hawaii.  The photography is incredible and it shows Hawaii's breathtaking scenery including beautiful beaches on Oahu and Maui, Mt. Haleakala and Waimea Canyon.  The music's great and the narration includes lots of travel tips as you're completely immersed in a Hawaiian vacation - volcanoes, exciting nightlife, surfing, scuba dives and hulas that "were so alluring that the missionaries banned them".  The only person who would not like this DVD simply doesn't want to unwind and relax during this fascinating travel guide.  After you see this you'll want to explore this paradise yourself and this DVD will help you plan your trip or your honeymoon
this movie is so good i can't even find it anywhere. if you come across a copy of this buy it. it is reminissant of american history x, or slc punk in the fact that it is mostly about teen-aged boys comming of age. while the first two movies were aimed at a pirticualy sceen, this will hit home for the rest of us. drugs are bad!! :
My 1 1/2 year old son really enjoys this toy. he loves putting the little men on top.  He doesn't play with the toys on the side, guess thats for younger kids, but he does enjoy the shape sorter and the drawbridge opening is cute and holds his attention.  I find an advantage over the classic Fisher price is that he can't as easily just rip the cover off and toss the pieces in when he gets frustrated.  At this age, I find the Alphabet pieces a waste and wish there were more shapes to sort.  Perhaps when he's older he'll enjoy the letters as well, but I doubt he'll still be interested.  Overall, cute toy that holds his attention while many do not.  Main drawback is that there are only 4 shapes to sort
I bought this Dakota backless booster for my nearly 6 year old.  She previously was using a Jupiter Komfort Kruiser XL100, which I loved.  The Komfort Kruiser was a booster with a back, and although it still fits her to this day, she was eager to move into a backless booster.  I think the Dakota booster works great.  It gets her to the height she needs for the seatbelt, but allows her to feel more like a big kid by not having a back.  This booster is a quality item and large enough to fit her until she will be old and large enough to no longer require a booster.  The pocket on the side is handy as well, although does not work well with drinks (I advise buying a bottle holder to put on the arm rest!)
AFTER 2 NIGHTS OF NO SLEEP BECAUSE OUR 18 MONTHS OLD SON FIGURED OUT HOW TO FLIP HIMSELF OUT OF THE PACK N PLAY (WITH JUST SHEER UPPER BODY STRENGTH!)I WAS SO RELIEVED TO FIND THIS CRIB TENT AND IT WAS A PAIN TO PUT TOGETHER (IT TOOK ABOUT 20 MINUTES) BUT WELL WORTH IT BECAUSE IT WORKS...HE HAS STAYED IN THE PACK N PLAY AND DIDN'T SEEM TO CARE AT ALL THAT HE WAS "TRAPPED", I THINK KIDS DO LIKE THE PLAYFULNESS OF A TENT. MY 4 YEAR OLD WAS JEALOUS! THERE ARE A FEW DOWNSIDES...ITS A PAIN TO SET UP AND BREAK DOWN AND IF YOUR USING THE PACK N PLAY FOR OVER NIGHTS AND TRAVEL IT ISN'T AS PORTABLE AS COULD BE...AND I HAVE AN OLDER PACK N PLAY, ITS FROM '02 WHEN WE HAD OUR FIRST BABY SO THE ENDS ARE HIGHER THAN THE SIDES SO THE CLIPS HAVE NO WHERE TO CLIP ONTO BUT IT HASN'T MATTERED. THE SIDE CLIPS HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TO KEEP OUR STRONG TODDLER IN PLACE. OVERALL THE PRODUCT IS EXPENSIVE AND A PAIN TO SET UP BUT PRICELESS BECAUSE IT LETS THE WHOLE FAMILY SLEEP SOUNDLY AND SAFELY!
I've read all of the reviews . I too own this model . It does what it was designed to do . BURLWOOD is much more ....overpriced ? People sometimes need to be taken by the hand . Especially the overpriveleged . You don't know what it's like to be rich untill you've been poor . AND...you don't know how good your winder is till' you find the proper direction . AS in all things , others are not going to do it for you ALL of the time . BUT in this case I'll make an exception . Some watches wind in both directions...you know - GO BOTH WAYS ? AS do a lot of ....back to the winder lesson , and some only go ONE WAY . Find out what way you need to go and GO THERE !...PROBLEM SOLVED ( help me..this isn't working...oh , PLEASE ! ) The moral too this story is "in a plastic world try not to always have WOOD !! GOD gave you a brain . Read my revie
T-mobile has the worst customer services. Sometimes, It is the company's mistake and they still blame it on the customer. Since I started my plan, I had a problem reciving my bill on time. So, the company start charging me $5 late fee for four consecutive months. Also, when I tried adding additional features such as their text-message-bundle, the change on the account did not take effect till two days later, and I was charged for 10 cents for each message I used in these two days,and It costed me an additional $4. Every time I tried complaining to their customer services, they just wouldn't listen. I am starting to get the feeling that they are just trying to maximize their profit. More than once, if I stay long-enough on the line, they put me on mute so they don't have to listen to my complaining. I feeling that I am being treated like dirt not like a customer. I had the worst customer-services experience with t-mobile. Also, the reception is not the best in the country. I had friends who were using the same phone as the one I have but different network, and they were getting services in places where I don't have it, and they pay about the same amount of money
The old DVD from 1997 looks better than the new HD version. I've compared the two, and the first DVD had good color saturation, dark blacks and looked right with the heavy red and brown palette. The HD version has a blue-green haze covering everything and the picture is too bright. They also removed the film grain and made the image look smooth and creamy. The sound quality is better now, though, and the image of course is higher resolution.
The cursor is so minute it is difficult to see it. ---  --- Makes the game unplayable in most suitable environments. ---  --- Design issue could be fixed easily
Great Product!..My wife gave it to me as a birthday present and I thought what a cheap gift..But who would have ever thought this would actually save me a year of tickets
This stuff is so boring. I can't believe people still listen to this stuff. Seriously come on people! I laugh every time I see some guy trying to play this stuff anywhere. Plus Busta has admitted to having "relationships" with men if you get what I mean. Makes you wonder about a lot of rappers....
BOUGHT THIS ITEM FOR MT SON, AND HE JUST LOVES IT. --- HE PLAYS WITH IT ALL THE TIME, FROM THE TIME HE GETS HOME --- FROM SCHOOL UNTIL DINNER TIME, AND FROM AFTER DINNER UNTIL BED TIME
I have to admit I was a little hesitant in sending this to my mom for Mother's Day.  There were so many mixed reviews from most of the Wine Country Gift Baskets.  My mom got it a few dasy before Mother's Day (which is better than after I guess.  She absolutly loved it.  Everyone said how lucky she was to have such a thoguhtful daughter.  So Yay!! I am thrilled and I will order from WCGB again
I originally planned to purchase Locin floss to replace the DenTek, but I'm not too pleased with it so far. ---  --- PLUSES --- ======= --- -Each individually wrapped floss. --- -Doesn't contain floride. ---  --- MINUSES --- ======= --- -Flimpsy handle--almost not usable. --- -Wrap is not 100% sealed. --- -flossing head is shallower and narrower than the DenTek
This product work perfectly in the Epson printer! The quality of printing is great!
These Colombian D'Ordado pods work well in my Krups Home Cafe machine. The overall flavor is good. I do like my coffee a little stronger, so I use 2 of these pods and the two-6 ounce cup setting for a nice, big mug of morning coffee
I was disappointed in this book.  The art and techniques illustrated are of the type one might expect to see on a TV Craft Show.   I would instead recomment Robert Wade's watercolor book.    
I've rarely had bad experiences with Microsoft mice or keyboards. Usually they tend to have above average design and put thought into the product. ---  --- They evidently didn't hire the "good" designer to work on this product however as this mouse has 2 glaring faults. ---  --- #1: The shallow height and shape of the mouse is such that it offers no support for your hand whatsoever. This causes hand strain and inconsistent hand placement as you use it. You never get the feeling that your hand is in "the right position". ---  --- #2: The side buttons are in brain dead locations. Why this is I have no idea, as other Microsoft models put the left side button right where your thumb would be if you move your thumb up slightly (the way it should be). On this "gaming" mouse the left thumb button is much too far forward causing you to have to practically re-adjust your grip on the mouse just to press it. Couple this with problem #1 and the lack of surface contact with your hand causes the mouse to skew under your hand as you press the button thus turning your player to one side when you didn't intend to. Just what you don't want when throwing a grenade. ---  --- The right button is sort of click-able with your pinky and is actually the more accessible button, but it feels more due to luck than planning. ---  --- I have to wonder if they even tested this design with any gamers at all before putting it out on the street. ---  --- I give it 2 stars because for the attempt at wireless feel with the thin cord, and it looks visually appealing. Calling this a "gaming" mouse however and charging a premium for it is a joke you should spare yourself being the butt of. ---  --- Rating: Not Recommended
Learn to Play Chess with Fritz and Chesster 2, continues where the first CD left off.  Like the first CD, this program may take some guessing regarding what exactly is one supposed to do, and clicking on the crown in the upper right corner helps to navigate through the game.   ---  --- This program is really good for grasping the basic tactics and strategies because your progress is measured and you have to develop certain skill proficiency before moving to higher level and learning more tactics and strategies. ---  --- The CD covers some popular opening moves, middle game tactics like pins, forks, skewers and deflection, and mating strategies in end game.  With practice on this CD, you can begin to win some games, and then move on to Learn to Play Chess with Fritz and Chesster 3, which is out in German, and is supposed to be out soon in English
I was going to buy this camera for my teenage daughter today, but after reading the reviews I decided that it is not a god risk if the customer service is that bad and the screen seems to break without any kind of impact.   --- I'm sure it takes nice pictures, but a lot of cameras take nice pictures.  I have to go where the service will at least respect you. 
The shape of this pendant is very flattering (elongated, draws the eye downward).  It looks great with the "Windows" hoops I purchased at the same time.  The chain is nice, and as with all Zina sterling - the silver is very polished and beautiful
We are delighted with our new chairs and table.  The products were well-packed and came in excellent condition.  The chairs are sturdy, ample and comfortable even without the cushions.  The cushions that come with are very nice, but too thick for my liking.  The chairs have an additional feature of leveling pads on the bottom of each leg that can be screwed in or out to accommodate uneven surfaces.  The table is big enough for a full dinner for four, but small enough to still feel intimate. We now spend a lot more time on our patio
Its effect very much depends on the climate you live in. If you live in a colder and dry climate, especially during winter it does exactly as it promises - great moisturizer, lines are diminished, as is puffiness. I really love using it - I am 35 and currently living in a cold and dry climate. But in hot and sometims humid climates, or during summer it just doesn't work as well - I don't know why. I like it a lot and this is my 3rd bottle, although I am using it as a seasonal eye care
In my previous review, very happy to receive my KC shoes but to my surprise these were a "disappointment"!  Very cheap looking, there were some visible defects (noticed right away), too small and the bottom of the shoe looked worn. Tribeca's are my favorite KC shoes but again, if you wear a 9, go a size up for a better fit and comfortability.   ---  --- Good luck, shoe shoppers
Our local Macy's recently offered free skin typing and the samples to go with it. I really only went to pick up a free moisturizer as I've found with some judicious sampling you don't have to pay for that item. Instead, I fell in love with this soap (and got free moisturizer too-hooray!!) ---  --- When the sales rep first handed me the bar soap, I balked. I've known people who've used Clinique but just the idea of washing my face with BAR soap freaked me out. They do offer a liquid version but the rep told me the soap was a better exfoliant. I can't say for sure if that's so but I can say this really is a great face wash. I was addicted after one use. And since it is a bar of soap, you'll get a really great sudsy foam. It has a mild, pleasant scent and it washes off easily. I have the mild version and I just love it. My skin feels clean but never tight and not only does it not cause breakouts, it immediately calmed the one I had. I'll definitely be buying more.  ---  --- I do want to add, however, it is drying in the wintertime if you have normal skin and I had to switch to a cream cleanser. It may not be a problem for oily skin. For dry skin, I'd really avoid it in the winter at least. ---  --- You still ideally need a makeup remover before the soap. I also became a recent convert to Clinique's Rinse Off Foaming Cleanser. But even if you don't want to use that product, remember that removing your makeup is a separate step.
My boyfriend just found out the hard way that he has a wheat gluten allergy. I've tried experimenting with different non wheat fours, but they're expensive and don't turn out very well.  (And I'm a good cook!) He especially misses shortbread and butter cookies, so we were thrilled to see these in a local market!  They're a little different, but they're good! This is coming from someone who hates store bought cookies.  I'd pick these over most wheat flour cookies any day
I received them OK none broken or cracked. This price beats Walmarts price and these cases are as good as any slim cases I have ever used. I like the translucent back better than the black ones at Staples
I bought the SR-60 after a lenghty review on the internet. My goal was to find the best available headphones for a low budget (around $80). I have been very satisfied with the SR-60. The sound is great, confort is incredible. Since sound is not contained they may be somewhat annoying for surrounding non-listeners. So if you are looking for first quality sound, low budget headphones and don't care to much about the looks, these are the ones to go with. 
I just received the 2007 version, and could not be happier. Like other Moleskine products, this weekly planner is of excellent quality. --- The layout is very simple, and the size is perfect for a purse. Each day in the week is allocated about 7 lines, with three days on one page, and four on the other (Sat and Sun share their space) --- I have owned notebooks of the same size (with similar leather cover), which I used daily, and have never experienced any problems with binding.  --- Overall, this is an excellent planner!
Fast delievery, great price and quality, we will enjoy it many years to come
I wasn't aware the only swords that existed and were noteworthy enough to grace the pages of an Encyclopedia were European. Seems to me much is left out by ignoring the Eastern blades
I've used Adobe products for years and years and will continue to do so
These are just delicious--and I like having the controlled portions in the bags--a very satisfying snack for 150 calories
I grew up with the original DS.  I also saw the two "spin off" movies: "House of Dark Shadows" and "Night of Dark Shadows."  Needless to say I was extremely excited about the "revival," and I wasn't disappointed.  I felt that Dan Curtis was actually able to improve upon the original, by tightening up the script and employing wonderful actors who fit like the proverbial glove.  The original Barnabus was played by Jonathan Frid who was a Shakespearian trained actor and, Ben Cross is a member of the Royal Shakespearian Theatre in London.  I loved that the revival was able to be more overtly sexual, which as any fan of vampires must know is an essential element of the myth.  And I must say this series lived up to my every expectation.  Dan Curtis took the original and made it completely accessible to older viewers who have such fond memories of the 1963 soap opera.  I looked forward to 3:30 every day after school.  It's too bad that the Gulf War killed it.  Yes it did!  I was there.  After the Sunday, Monday miniseries, that Friday was to air the first "episode."  However it was pre-empted by coverage of the War.  Too, too bad.  I taped it, but unfortunately the last few episodes were accidentally taped over.  I am so glad to know that I can order it now in it's magical entirety.  I'm ordering it right now!  Thank you Amazon!!!!!!! ---  --- If you are a fan of things that go bump in the night, you will LOVE this series!!!!
Very good movie.  Great acting & plot.  Very touching.  I am very glad I own this movie.  I will watch it very often
I thought this product was easy to use and produced decent results.  It works better than some of the more expensive software; I have tried at least a half-dozen similar programs, but I keep returning to this bargain-bin favorite.  For the money, it is an excellent value. 
Perhaps a pediatrist who knows better designed this shoe's insert, but I hated it. It felt half-there. There was good cushion at the back and felt like none at the front - like those "orthotic" deals that come on infomercials. Well, it didn't feel good on my tender forefoot so I sent them back. ---  --- On the other hand, the shoe looked great. I guess, if you really want it, shoe can go shopping for some Dr. Scholl's
Takes FOREVER to shave - and still doesn't get everything - still have to end up shaving with a razor.  Frustrating - but good concept
I am a new subscriber, have received two issues so far. This is a fascinating magazine, beautifully laid out, and well written. In the first issue I received (which I have now read almost cover-to-cover, something I Never do with magazines), there were articles about Dog rescue in Asia, the science of the historical relationship between Dogs and their humans, emotional vignettes about the love between Dogs and humans and so much more. --- I like the reviewer who likened this magazine to the New Yorker about Dogs. The first issue was chock-full of everything from useful tips to weepy stories to fascinating science. --- I made an effort to cancel all of my magazine subscriptions recently, simply because I do not have the time to read them all. This one will remain. In fact, I may start archiving this magazine-it is that good! All of our guests inevitable pick up the magazine, drawn by the crisp graphics, and retained by a healthy variety of reading. --- Obviously, I am a fan. I have barely started the second issue, but from skimming the articles, I have full faith that I will not be disappointed. --- Subscribe and enjoy
I do video work and was attracted to the sale price and extra height of this particular tripod.  Come to find out, this model does not have a fluid head, meaning, if you do any panning with a camcorder, it won't be as smooth as you'd probably like it to be.  Also, at the end of a pan the head tends to "unwind," causing your panned image to back up a little ways.  Thus, I think it's rather misleading to label this as a "Photo / Video" tripod.   ---  --- Additionally, I don't really care for the cheap feel of some of the plastic knobs and adjusters.  Finally, mine came with a few, very minor cosmetic blemishes, almost as if it were used. ---  --- Instead of video, I'll be utilizing this one as a microphone mount. ---  --- If you want to do video, please buy a tripod with a fluid head.  You'll love it, I guarantee that. ---  --- That's why I give this one 2 stars
If you do not yet own Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here AND The Wall, do not even consider purchasing A Momentary Lapse of Reason. AMLOR is junk by comparison. ---  --- That said, very few rock albums ever made can hang with those three, and AMLOR certainly has its bright spots. "Learning to Fly" and "On the Turning Away" are as good as anything Pink Floyd has ever produced. Some of the other songs are adequate, but this album does not contain the front-to-back brillance of the earlier Floyd releases. It's definitely worth having, but make sure that you have the others first. --- 
After I read the reviews on this toy, I wanted to cancel my order. Thankfully I didn't because my kids love it. I have two boys 5 & 9 and they love bowling with this toy. My kids have played with it since we got it in Feburary. In the reviews, people said the toy broke soon after playing with it. My kids play with it all the time and we have not had any problems. Everything still works great; the pins, the sound, and the ball return.
My son received this when he was 15 months old and has never stopped playing with it regularly.  He loves putting things in the back and zooming around the living room.  Great buy
After buying this camera I was pleased for the most part, as the interface is extremely simple and the picture quality is very good. It's a sleek, smooth design with minimal buttons, thus little confusion. There are 3 things, however, that I'm not happy with. One is that it takes double A batteries, and eats them up REALLY fast. The second thing is that there's no secondary viewfinder, just the LCD screen. The LCD screen is large, which is great.. but this is why the battery life is so low. You can't turn the LCD screen off, so batteries go fast. The third and final thing I dislike about it is that there's no AC adaptor, so whenever you plug your camera into the computer or the TV, not using it to take pictures, you have to run it on batteries. That is, unless you somehow find a compatible 3 volt AC plug, which is neither on the Vivitar website, or anywhere else online that I can find made specifically for this camera. I'm a little upset that it came with no adapter, as that would be SO useful for a camera that eats up batteries. I reccomend rechargibles if you're going to get this camera
I especially like this product for traveling and sitting in waiting rooms. My only complaint is that you have to hold it just right to see the puzzle clearly on the screen.  It has a contrast adjustment, but it not very helpful.  It also has a lighted screen option which is not very good either. A great improvement would be a screen with greater contrast. 
I had the La Crosse WS-2310 "Professional" Weather Station for 2 years, and it was NEVER fully functional.  I had to return the unit 3 times, as well as do a store replacement once, and I used the system for a year without the wind speed unit working - I simply didn't want the cost of returning the system yet again.  The software is absolutely horrible, and during the 2 years I had the system, there was never any software upgrades at all.  Given how deficient the software was, this was quite surprising.  For example, there is no calculation of daily rain amounts or monthly rain amounts.  The system is too stupid to differentiate between days.  The date recorded to the simple spreadsheet database is always one day off (yesterday's date is recorded today).  Overall, the software looks to be a high schooler's science project done the night before it was due. If you're going to purchase a La Crosse system, plan on spending money on 3rd party software, as well as allowing about 30% of your purchase price in product return costs. La Crosse tech support is non-existant: call & get a recorded message to leave your number & they will return the call - but they NEVER do... and I do mean NEVER!  Send an email and the same response - NONE!  It's a very frustrating joke.  After 2 years, I gave up and purchased a truly professional system from a competitor.  My only regret was having waited 2 years to throw in the towel with La Crosse.  I give La Crosse 1 star only because there is no 0 star rating
I have a hard time believing that the author has ever seen an episode of TNG. I had to force myself to finish this book it was so bad. By far the worst Star Trek book I have ever read.  If you want a good one read 'Federation' and stay as far away from this one as you can
this boat seemed like a great idea, and my 7 month baby does like it. it gets him in the water, which is fun, but i cant even take my eyes off him for one nano-second. he has fallen over the sides, he has fallen forward between the seat and tube. the seat is so small and there is so much space between it and the tube. my babys legs fit fine in the leg opening. this boat is dangerous. i am looking for a new one
I was impressed by the look of this bag.  It really looked like it would seal the contents well.  Unfortunately, it did not.  I tried several times, and each time, the contents of the bag were soaked! --- Fortunately I tested it out with just some cash for a day at the pool... and only ended up with soggy money.  If I had put my cell phone and watch in the bag, they would have been ruined. --- I DON'T RECOMMEND IT
I just don't know where to start.  There just doesn't seem to be a way to describe the comfort.  You will just have to try them on to believe it.  My neighbor, mother, husband and I all swear by this product.  Accept no substitutions.   Attractive...no, but the comfort will blow you away
The best out of three guide books I looked at, and a must for the first trip to the big island. 
After being into the "techno" scene since my first party in 1993, this is one of the best videos I have seen describing the DJ feelings. You really get a feel for how a DJ thinks. If you at all interested in the DJ lifestyle or are interested in DJing this is a must have. It have great insights in the minds of some of the best DJs around. Plus Nigel Richards does a great job with the "How to DJ" part. Not only is this for the "newbies" but for those who have been around a bit. Plus he makes learning fun with his comments and body mannerisms. WOW that sounded like an infomercial
I love this product, and the rest of the Pack-It system, beyond all reason.  I've given them as gifts repeatedly. ---  --- In effect, they give you "drawers" in your suitcase, and sub-drawers within the drawers of hotel dressers.  It's easy to take out a pair of slacks without disarranging everything else.  ---  --- The 18" folder works well for womens' shirts, blouses, and slacks.  I can easily fit say three pairs of slacks and two shirts into it.  If you want to carry more or fewer pieces, it's forgiving.  I use it for suit jackets too, folding them in across the width of the folder. ---  --- I've used mine often over perhaps 8 years, and they still look like new. ---  --- A standard-sized 21" roll-aboard suitcase will neatly hold: 1 18-inch folder (this product), two full-sized Pack-It cubes, a small pack-it sac holding travel adapters and rechargers, a toiletries bag (not from this sytem) and a pair of shoes (squeezed).  It also works to omit the cubes and use two 18" folders, depending on the clothes being packed.
I recently became a fan of Body Shop products and am only sorry that I didn't try them sooner.  Their products are all, without fail, of superior quality.  The Satsuma line especially is wonderful, and is my favorite scent from the Body Shop.  It is the juicy fresh smell of tangerines/oranges.  I have read some reviews that it reminds people of a creamsicle type scent but I completely disagree with that. I have never liked creamsicle scents and I love Satsuma.  It is not cloying or too sweet.  It is a very pure scent and I always feel clean and beautiful while wearing it.  One other thing to note about this product...  I do not always like perfume oils because the scent is not always accurate when compared to other products in the same line.  I am not sure if this is because sometimes the oils are so concentrated that they smell like "too much".  The Satsuma oil is not like that at all - it smells true to the rest of the line.  The scent also lasts for a long time after being applied, due to the fact that it is a perfume oil.  A little goes a long way - I would not be surprised if the bottle lasted for over a year.  I love this product and give it my highest recommendation.  
What a beautiful bicycle!! I thought it was black and white from the photo but it's a really lovely forest green and white. It was really easy to put together myself.  My husband is really excited about it. He's pretty tall and this bike is more comfortable size for him than his last cruiser.  Very happy with this purchase! Great price too!  My own Schwinn cruiser came from a local shop and was twice as much. 
Great towel for the gym or after swimming.  Very absorbant and I also use one to cover the circuit machines when I use them
I purchased this watch for my father as a gift.  The blue face is beautiful, the numbers are easy to read, it's light weight and keeps perfect time.  He loves this watch and has had many compliments since he started wearing it
light, intricate, and very cute! They came very quickly, and the price was very fair! I have a second piercing in my left ear and I like to wear one there so along with my other jewelry I always have a fairy whispering in my ear :
Okay, it's not one of the fancy, traditional mags but I found loads of things that generated ideas. The sections showing design elements carried through the house were my favorites.  It may be on the advertising end of the spectrum in some regards, but I liked seeing similar (but different) approaches to the same design goal by various manufacturers.  Having all the web addresses made it easy for me to follow-up on designs I liked, and I didn't have to worry that the editors were trying to curry favor with their advertisers by pontificating on the merits of one item over another. ---  --- I'm a visual learner and this fit the bill. Unlike another reviewer who would suggest that this is due to my gender, I think that people respond differently to the same presentation of material.  Don't write this off because it's not a marquee magazine--try it first.  You might just like it.  And by the way, I do read and like magazines and books that have no pictures, too
these earings are the worst! they are way too heavy and the rocks on the bottom weent the same color! on was grey and one was black! I dont recommend this
This is a great little barbecue.  From carne asadaa to teryaki flank ribs, this little guy does a great job.
 My 2 year old grandson loves balls of any kind,when I found this activity set I knew he would really enjoy it,he plays with it for hours. The only downside of this is that he cannot keep up with the balls. It would be great if this company would give parents,or grandparents an order form to get replacement balls to give this fun toy longer life
Very well satisfied . It's great for a kid to learn to tell time,and the design with velcro strap makes it very adjustable
I found this product good, i have no problems with it what so ever. some people say just buy a dvd player but then you have more wires in the back of your tv. Also if you want your x box and dvd player to go into one suround sound or stereo the is great cause you get to have a dvd player and a x box in one wire going into the speakers. this is also great if you dont want to spend any more money on buying another dvd player and you already have a xbox. i have my xbox upstairs with the dvd adapter, and a dvd player down stairs so if i want a change of secnery. ---  --- i love my xbox and it's adapter i have no problem with the remote either
If your a Pacino fan this is for you one of his earlier films --- This deals with a lawyer not a crooked lawyer but a good mostly honest lawyer and all the things that a lawyer has goon through or could go through this is a instant classic and the story to the movie is excellent  ---  --- Highly recomende
This is great-my daughter looks for reasons to use and wear the quick gems
I purchased the non-premium kit ($9.99) with a Silicone skin case cover and 2 screen protectors (one for each screen), but it is the same case.  The problem is that the silicone skin cover is slippery, twice as slippery as the Nintendo Lite without the cover. We thought that washing them in Dove dish soap would wash away the slipperyness, but that didn't work. After handling the cover, your hands have a slippery residue on them.  The other issue is that the cover is so thin that it is little more than scratch protection, not impact protection.  The screen covers that come with the non-premium kit are ok, I guess, but one of them had 2 defect particles that were raised (trust me, the screen was clean).   ---  --- I purchased 2 kits, and I had one screen protector defect and my wife accidentally broke one of the silicone covers hinge straps with little effort.  I do not recommend this product at all
i ordered this last fall for a 40th party it looks nice but after a windy day a piece of the top broke off and after that it all fell apart because it didnt have any support from the broke top rail
Product was supposedly shipped 1-4-07 and still do not have i
I DIDN'T RECEIVE THE MAT YET. BUT I ALREADY ORDERED IT, I AM  DISAPPOINTED TO SEE, OTHERS GOT THE SAME ITEM FOR 12.OO DOLLARS. AND 9.99. BUT I AM PAYING DOUBLE THE PRICE
If you want to do the same exercise over and over.. but with better make up and cuter outfit go ahead. ---  --- If you want better exercises and articles look to Oxygen or Women's M&
I added these batteries to an order of a few other things, and didn't realize that they were going to ship this separately from Circuit city. Make sure if you pick this, that you are getting something else from CC, or else you will end up like me. With a huge box (you could fit 4 Tom Clancey novels in the box) shipped to you with a pack of batteries and end up paying more for shipping then you spend on the batteries
Maybe beginning ones were a bad batch? Had mine months now and it works great. Everything it says, it does. No problems  keeping it in the system and did not cause any errors.
This was the most user unfriendly Turbotax I have ever used.  The Schedule C imported misinformation, had to keep forcing in the correct info. And I just found out my State taxes were received showing I owed a completely different amount than what I had electronically filed.  I have used this program for years, but after this, NEVER AGAIN!!! Let this be a warning to others
This dryer works great but it gets pretty hot.  Watch your ears and fingertips
I like this case very much for my Blackberry.  It definitely improves the grip on the Blackberry especially when I'm using it as a phone.  It also serves as an excellent protector when I throw it in my purse.  My two problems are that I wish there was more variety in the colors available similar to the Speck Ipod protective cases.  (Come on guys!  Women use these items too!)  Also, the rubber strip between the screen and the keyboard has become loose and not fitted to the Blackberry in the week that I've had this case.  Other than those two things, this is a great, not bulky case. 
Worked well five times. Then it slowed down and made cutting more difficult despite removing head and running water through it to clean, as per instructions. Then it would run before cutting, but upon trying to edge trim my moustache, it would stop immediately, as if a single hair could jam it. Removing head, as required for cleaning, showed that bottom part with its drive motor worked fine, with a rotating metal stub that fit loosely into a poorly made plastic part that moved the blade. It appears that this plastic part's stability, shape and alignment changed after a few uses allowing hairs to jam its movement. A poor design that shouldn't have used plastic. Do not bu
I've read many books on meditation and while each of them answers some of my questions, Jack Kornfield's book, A Path with Heart, answers every one save those that must be experienced first-hand in one's own time.  His  voice and advice is articulate, intelligent, humorous, open, patient and  wise.  He starts out by telling you a little about his own experience, goes  on to cover the basics of vipassana meditation and then leads you bit by  bit deep into the issues every meditator and spiritual seeker must face.   What I love most about his teaching style is that he gives gentle,  practical advice on the day-to-day, minute by minute stuff to do to  explore, commit to, love being on the path.  If my house were on fire and I  had to grab only one book on my way out the door, it would be A Path with  Heart
AFI finally release a live DVD, and as a portrayal of the band as it stands now, it is very impressive. It does lack older, more hardcore punk tracks, but that is to be expected as the band grows and matures into the  band it is now. Each album progresses towards more epic scales, and songs balance beauty with power. "I Heard a Voice" captures this on film, and the fan gets to witness AFI at their most grandiose. Watching vocalist Davey Havok sing "God Called in Sick Today" while being held up by the audience is amazing to watch and gives this reviewer chills everytime. The masterful command of theatrics from each member, especially Havok, creates a powerful feeling unable to fully describe but easy to appreciate. The setlist itself is perfectly put together, with the only gripe being the exclusion of "Kiss and Control." The rest of the songs display all facets of AFI, from the fast paced "Dancing Through Sunday",(which includes a nicely executed guitar solo by guitarist Jade Puget) "Kill Caustic", "Death of Seasons", "Totalimmortal" and "A Single Second", (the last of which features a guest appearance by Nick 13 of Tiger Army) to the slower paced "This Time Imperfect" and "Endlessly, She Said" as well as all of their recent singles, and a few more cuts from their latest releases "Decemberunderground" and "Sing the Sorrow". Extras are geared towards the fans, with Despair Faction interviews and the inclusion of videos from their massive scavenger hunt prior to the Decemberunderground release, as well as a poster.  ---  --- Each band member has their moments to shine, and are all very capable and talented muscians. Bassist Hunter Burgan and drummer Adam Carson lay down a solid foundation as well as background vocals, as Puget layers his unique guitar sound and obvious mastery, in this genre, over the instrument. This is all built up to allow Havok to use his unique vocal approach to wander in between melodies and notes, mixing powerful singing with a fantastic screaming voice, to create beautiful atmospheres of sound that can crash down on you just as easily as it hypnotizes you. ---  --- The quality of the sound production as well as the video edits are fantastic. Unlike other live DVD's, where the concert is edited to the point of a music video, "I Heard a Voice" has just the right amount to not make you forget you are watching a live dvd, but also add to the overall effect of the performance. The sound is very clear, and the sound levels are perfectly set to allow each member to cut through the mix.  ---  --- This is overall a very stellar production, and fans who have already embraced the new direction of the band, as well as new fans and casual fans, should find the dvd to be quite entertaining and a very worthwhile buy
product functions well, and looks good. --- If I could change one thing, the swivel action is just a little looser than I would like, but definatly not a problem
This was my favorite episode as a kid.  I was so happy to see I could download it to watch with my kids
I got this system for my 18 mo. old who was playing a game by sticking his leg through the slats of his crib and then claiming he was "stuck".  They have helped prevent him from doing that any more.  However, if he's in the mood, he can easily dismantle the entire contraption - so it won't work to keep an older child from tearing it apart if they want to.  In fact, the two end panels had to be removed because he wouldn't leave them alone.  All in all though, I think the mesh "bumpers" do what they claim and they work well at keeping toys (and pluggers) in the crib instead of out on the floor
Great magazine.  This is not my typical type of read, because I've never considered myself as someone into computers or multi-media.  But the great thing about this magazine is that you don't have to be someone that already knows a lot about technology to learn about the latest gizmos.  It tells you about them in simple terms too, no high-tech vocabulary needed.  I feel informed whenever I read my monthly subscription, of the better products to purchase, as well as the politics behind the big computer and internet companies
I really could not tell you anything, as I still have not recieved this game, despite having paid for it over a month and a half ago
I use my belt holster with all the phones i've owned, my i530 is no --- exception. This belt holster feels really well made, it has a strong belt clip which is good for how hard I use it. A big plus is that I can use my phone while it's in the holster
I bought this gadget with the intent of monitoring my daily steps to get an idea of where I was currently to establish some sort of baseline so that I could get a reality check on my activity levels.  I opened the box, read the easy directions, set up my personal step measurement (just measure off the distance of your 10 steps), and clipped it on my pants and forgot about it for the day.  I was surprised to find out that a corpse could probably move around more during the day than me! Over the next 6 days, (this pedometer keeps track of 7 days of steps for you); I literally stepped up my game and went from 756 steps with NO aerobic exercise on day 1, to 7,880 steps with 30 minutes of nonstop aerobic exercise on day 3! Every day has been getting easier to achieve the 10,000 "normal" steps, and increasing the aerobic steps too (which are tracked separately). I can press the mode button, check out how many miles my steps translate to, kilocalories burned, aerobic steps, and compare it with the past 7 days as well. It has turned out to be even more fun than what I originally bought it for. I actually feel better, and the fun part is that I am trying to beat my own personal record from the previous day! This has been an eye-opening experience for me, and I keep this on or in my pocket all the time now, just to make sure I keep a mindful eye on my steps and aerobic activity for the day
que maravilla comprar por amazon.com todo llego en perfecto estad
All the reviews so far sound like personal friends of B.W. who are puffing the book. The book is simple and would require more information. So why not just go buy a book with more information.
The title really says it all! I make a point to keep a soup can packed with these next to the pencil cup on my desk. I haven't gotten the two confused yet
The Satinelle Ice Epilator does exactly what it is supposed to do: remove hair quickly and efficiently by the root. What an advantage! Hair does not reappear as quickly as it does shaving, and when it does, it is not the sharp stubble that happens with shaving. ---  --- I don't think it hurts much, though some spots may be a bit more sensitive than others. The trick then is to simply lift it up off of the skin and stop momentarily.  ---  --- I am very happy with this product
I bought this for my 3yr old twins, and from the first showing, I kept hearing giggling and laughing as they watched the cartoons. My girls already are familiar with some fairy tales, so they really loved "The Three Little Pigs" and "The Pied Piper". I highly recommend this DVD and think it is a great buy for parents with young children
I don't know who these people are, but they will give praise for ANYTHING!  Ms. London is a wonderful singer, but the producers must have given her sleeping pills.  This is a boring CD!  Like Peggi Blu, who won Star Search, her record company "toned her down" for her debut album, with banal and boring songs with that stupid hip/hop "dum de dum" Mary J. Blige beat, which will send you to nowheresville.   ---  --- Aretha Franklin's boring SO DAMN HAPPY was so awful, it's no longer available.  She went "Mary J." and almost lost the crown off her head.  Because she's Aretha Franklin (Queen of Soul) she DID manage (somehow) to get a non-deserved Grammy for "Wonderful" from that CD.  The Grammys also presented The Queen with her 17th competitive Grammy for her "A House Is Not A Home" mess.  What MUST they be thinking? ---  --- Well, LaToya London won't be considered for ANYTHING for this hip/hop mess.  She should get serious about some R & B (I mean the REAL r & b) and leave this light-weight fluff alone.  LaToya, you have a great voice -- use it.  Contact Sam Dees, Jo Armstead or Ashford & Simpson and BEG for some material! And, as Madame Rose would say, "Sing Out, Louise!!!
I love this book! It is a terrific blend of hand-holding and concrete advice for writers. Each chapter takes the writer/reader through the tough questions we face when we sit down to write: How do we begin? Where do ideas come from? Is there a ritual we can create that will help us begin? I like the fact that I could use this book as a resource. In other words, I did not have to read it cover to cover. Rather, it truly serves as a guide, a mentor's guide, that can serve me as I continue to write. I really liked the movie section,  where Cathleen Rountree uses movies to make points about the writing process.  I found those sections inspirational and useful. If you want to be a writer or if you are already writing, I urge you to Buy this book
I admittedly have not completed the full book, as it is thick.  However I do find that the narrative focuses on the reactive rather than the proactive tools needed for DFSS.  For example almost all the examples given in section 2 talk about an existing system or process and there doesn't seem to be any design examples and how the stats are used to solve the design problems.  I therefore think the book is more about Six Sigma than DFSS. ---  --- Barry
I grew up with this, and introduced my husband to it a few years ago.  He likes HP MUCH better than A1.  I use it on steak, hamburgers, meatloaf and roast beef sandwiches! ---  --- Try it out
These are by far the best tasting Spirulina bars in the market. The  whole line is more desert like in concept, so of course they are sweet & chewy. People with IBS probably should not eat finely chopped raw nuts and should read ingredients before buying!! ---  --- The food is safe for celiac, and most food allergens (AGAIN READ THE LABEL BASED ON YOUR DIETARY SITUATION!) ---  --- The bars travel very well and although they may bend and mush, because they are naturally moist and chewey, melting? Never. All the bars in this line travel great and can sit for months in hot or cold. ---  --- These are particularly good for athletes and people on the run. ---  --- Oh, and the price, come on, there is nothing else that even comes close for the size and quality
I only got the first issue, but it seems to be focused more on poets than other writers (hence the name).  i dont enjoy poetry but i love writing fiction.  They might do well to keep the two separate, especially the contests and events.  It's an attractive format and very upscale, high quality literature reviews and advice.  The stories are well written and enjoyable, although i think writers digest offers more for fiction writers
Very politically manipulative primer that only gives 5/8 of the story. I add 1/8 because the author does acknowlege some of the huge problems caused by unbridled global capitalism, but then quickly glosses them over basically saying that these effects are unfortunate, but that free global trade is best for everyone in the long run. There is a lot of interesting incidental information as various terms are explained, but too often this reference becomes a one-sided sermon for free trade. These are the same deceptions that Robert Reich started pushing under Clinton. Repubs kept the song going without missing a beat. Most of both Dem and Repub reps support neoliberal policies - the rich get richer in both parties. Feel free to read to learn about terms, just be aware that the author is leading you down a highly biased path
This is a vary good game one of the best on the PS2 these are my top ten favorite fighters  --- 1) Asuka Kazama --- 2) Christie Monteior --- 3) Ling Xiaoyu --- 4) Kazuya Mishima --- 5) Jin Kazama --- 6) King --- 7) Eddy Gordo --- 8) Nina Williams --- 9) Anna Williams --- 10) Devil Jin --- The only bad thing is Jinpachi Mishima cant be unlocked which sucks the DevilWithin mini game is ok Arcade is ranked overall the games is awsome and addicting you'll be playing for hours on end later.   
My daughter loves the sticker maker but she used the cartridge in one day and still has plenty of stickers left to make and I can not find the refills anywhere.  They need to make the refills for these types of toys easier to get.  I am to hesitant to buy the bead maker now because of that and I know my daughter would like it but It's a waste if it's a one time use and upsets my daughter
I bought two of these as a gift for my husband.  He'd previously bought himself one of those eletronic tie racks and the thing fell apart while he was trying to get it installed.  These were ready to go right out of the box, no assembly required, took up less space in his closet than the 3-4 hangers with ties wrapped around them that he had, and have made his tie collection managable and easy to select from.  The cushioned tie "hooks" ensure the ties will not slip off, and also that they will not be damaged.  A breeze to organize his vast tie collection.  And he's loving this product
This product is not worth the money.  It does not keep the car cool and was a waste of my money.  Beware of products that only make money for the inventor
I saw the other review that said it didn't work for V173, but I bought this anyway for my V170.  It also doesn't work for V170.  Why Amazon is advertising and selling this product as a Motorola V170 charger is beyond me.  I guess sometimes the products are mislabeled. 
Multi-element add-on lense used with Kodak DX-7590 provides good wide-angle capability.  Note that this is a very large add-on lense (screws into DX-7590 extension-piece which costs an additional $20).  Does the job well in most portraiture and scenic applications, however two caveats: --- (1) Slight curvature of field in extreme corners of wide-angle shots (ie, corners of shots may be noticeably out of focus).   Suggest cropping to 95% of original picture to maintain sharpness across plane. --- (2) Size of lense will render pop-up flash and outside the lense focusing system (Ultra-sonic) less functional. 
Before I get K10D, I experienced with Olympus E-500, CANON XTI, Nikon D80. --- I used Olympus E-500 to take lots vivid color pictures that I love very much, but no water resistance and no second Display window, also only 3 focus point makes it not so enjoyable. Same thing happen to Canon XTi, no water resistance and no second Display window make it little hard to use when you need to change settings. The Nikon D80 is a great camera but also have no water resistance and shake reducer build in on camera, the color tone of D80 isn't the kind that I would love. Finally I bought Pentax K10D, the feeling of the body,the water resistance, shake reducer,auto dust remove,vivid color tone,etc...makes me feel the K10D is the way to go. Only complaint would be the Limited Edition Lens are hard to get. Get it while you can
When putting together the mobile section of this item, I was very disappointed in its flimsiness. It looks like just a few knocks will cause the screws to break from the plastic.  --- When I turned it on I was disappointed a second time, this time by the irritating buzzing sound that the mobile makes as it rotates. It's so loud you can't hear the music, which is a shame because I'm sure my son would enjoy looking at the moving lights. --- The third disappointment - the buttons are VERY hit-and-miss. Sometimes the music buttons don't work (the lullaby one worked eventually once I mashed it in really hard). That I could live with, but it's fiddling with the other controls that is really irritating. Control for music off, lights on/off and rotation on/off all seem to be tied up in two buttons. If you have the music and lights going, then turn on the rotation, the music and lights will go off as the rotation comes on. Then you have to press buttons in whatever order seems logical until you get them all going the way you want them. Please bear in mind I am NOT particularly daft - I managed to figure out my TIVO remote in a day or so - but the controls for this baby's musical mobile make no sense to me. I thought at first it was supposed to be deliberately challenging in order to stimulate 'baby's natural curiosity', but after two nights it really got on my nerves, and if I can't figure it out, I don't see how my one year old is supposed to. I can only think that there is something very screwed up with the circuitry in there.  --- I'm not dismissing this item all together. The music is lovely - not too simplified and not too electronic-sounding. The Minute Waltz is particularly nice (I've noticed my son scans for it). The lights are lovely too, and do look pretty when they're moving if you can stand the buzzing. My son has come to depend on the music to amuse himself with as he falls asleep. BUT, if you buy it, I'd recommend testing the buttons and the motorized rotator before screwing the very flimsy mobile pieces together in case you need to return it.
The author is a sociologist and tells of testing the opinions of two groups as to OJ's guilt. [There was no test as to the extent of their actual knowledge!] You won't learn anything new from this book. It has a long list of books on the subject, but the author gave no ratings or summaries on them. Were they all equal in quality? ---   --- The OJ case received more publicity than the Oklahoma City bombing or the Clinton impeachment. The National Association of Editors and Publishers has never told of the reasons for its play in the news. Could it have been intended as a distraction from other news? In May 1994 the newspapers carried stories on how North Korea was ready to attack and start a war; this was repeated weekly. In 1999 I read that President Carter had been sent on a diplomatic mission to North Korea (must have been a success, since the propaganda stopped). ---   --- Could the double murders in Brentwood have been well-publicized as a distraction? Isn't two murders a day the usual LA statistics? How many other waiters (just from Mezzaluna) were murdered each year? Are murders by organized crime often solved? ---  --- The book "Killing Time" noted that restaurants and health clubs (in LA and elsewhere) were often used a fronts for drug dealing and prostitution. If this explains the murders, you won't find much in this book. [My experience is that most white Americans made up their minds in June 1994 and never let the new facts interfere with their prejudgment.]
A few of my favorite painters are contemporaries of Still, so I saw it as my duty to see the Hirschhorn exhibition.  Well, I picked a dead day and had the show to myself and simply put I am now a fan.  The book is great and David Anfam's addition to the book is especially enlightening about the work of Still
I purchased two chairs, one for me and one for my husband. For me the chair is perfect. I weight about 110 but my husband who is about 270 it is not so good!! (Chair is way to small for him) I love it for myself because when I take my children to the beach it is very easy for me to carry along with all the other beach accessories!! I would recommend it for someone looking for a light weight chair that is easy to bring along places
I bought this same mattress in 2004 for my first son, and we never had any problems.  Easy to clean and firm; yet soft enough for my son to sleep through the night starting at 3 months.  When we were surprised at the news of a second, I bought this from Amazon on sale--the fabric design is different (blue and white checks), but otherwise it seems the same to me.  But one comment: if you don't get it on sale here you might try to buy it in store because the shipping is around $20.  It depends on what you're willing to pay for convenience
I love this carrier (I bought it in Feb 2007). My daughter loves it too. She can sleep very well in it. The only problem is it can only hold up to 22lb, while mine is already 17lb (she is only 3 months). I guess I don't have too much time to use it. If this company could develop a one which suits for big baby, I will definitely buy it. --- ji
I've had this for about a week, and it seems to be working very well. The "autoscan" feature is very nice since I seemed to forget to switch between "city" and "highway" with my older units. ---  --- The voice prompts are very clear, and the automute keeps the annoying beeps to a comfortable level. ---  --- I've had several radar detectors over the years, and this one certainly seems to be the best so far. It is also rated very highly in the amgazine articles I found
These are thin solid and dark patties that cook up tasteless, juiceless and unburgerlike in texture.  Completely unlike their advertising and unlike the regular beef patties sold at the supermarket.  I will never buy Omaha Steak products again. ---  --- Omaha Steaks' customer representatives are very nice however.  I wrote to them telling them about my experience and they said I could dump the scary meat and they would credit my card.  Thank you very much.
Incredibly useful!  Exactly what I need all in one place
haven't tried cooking with them yet. but they arrived quickly and are not damaged or bruised in any way. they are beautiful specimens. i immediately vacuum sealed and froze them
Guys I Cant Tell you how much u'll leave other software and stay with ableton ! rememeber Sky is the limite in ableton
We bought our Performer about 2 years ago from our local hardware store. It was the best purchase we ever made! Its a beautiful thing to have a charcoal grill with a gas ignition....about 15-20 minutes you're ready to grill. For the people who own a gas grill and are considering the Performer but are concerned about dealing with charcoal...its a piece of cake (we had our reservations too!) and you're going to wish you switched sooner. Food never tasted so good
Hello world,Wowee zowee, very "wacky" little gem. Remember seeing the cover when my Dad took me into the video store, I was around 6 or 7 and it stuck in my mind. When I was about 21 or 22 one of my friends flat buddies had it on Beta tape, so I borrowed it cause I still have a Beta(really shouldn't have mentioned that). A true slasher basher not for the timid, truly written and directed by booby hatch patients, and were they found the actors is beyond me! Filmed in georgeous New Jersey of course not far from the original Friday the 13th. Its a real winner!!! Creepiest Mom ever. Love her old dodge or plymouth?
The strawberry milkshake shower gel smells just like Bonomo turkish candy I bought when I was a kid. I like it but I think the shower gel is overrated due to exposure on QVC.  Other shower gels are creamier than this. I'll enjoy using this and the Eggnog then go back to making my own
I had high expectations when purchasing a laser range finder for use on the golf course. After a lot of research, I settled on the Pro Tour Laser.  --- As previous reviewers have stated, this unit is very hard to stabilize.  I have a feeling this is true of all lasers.  --- Even with supporting both elbows on the hood of a car I found this unit very hard to find yardages for objects beyond 150 yards paricularly when bright sunlight is present.  --- On the golf course, finding the flag and obtaining a yardage at longer yardages is almost impossible if there are objects behind the flag such as trees or landscaping.  --- This unit has been returned and I have gone to a standard handheld GPS instead. Once the center of the green is initially saved as a waypoint, this is a very reliable and quick method to get a yardage, you just have to convert feet or 1/100's of a mile into yards. I do this with a chart taped on the back of the GPS. Accuracy is about 2-4 yards which is good enough for anyone but a vey low handicapper.  --- I am staying away from a laser finder until golf courses uniformly put reflectors on their poles. 
WATCH IS A VERY STURDY AND WATER RESISTANT TIME PIECE HOWEVER, THE RESIN BAND IS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AT TIMES
If you are a Christian, this book isn't for you. It is full of blashphemy, concluding that we must "... forgive God" and that we must love God "... even if He isnt perfect". Kusher even has the will to say that "...God would not be God..." without our love for Him. At one point he reduces God to an aminal saying that in the garden of Eden, when God said "...let US make man in OUR image" he was speking to animals and creation. Kusher explains that God created the world, and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution. ---  ---   Since when was God in need of forgiveness? Isnt it that "... God so loved the world" and it wasnt us that loved God? I have no words in describing this book. It is full of error, because it does not base it self on the Gospel of Jesus Christ. All this book does is frees you from the thought that you are a sinner, and that it isnt your fault, and that actully you are a good person. Why do bad things happen to good people? Wrong question. There are no good people in the world in the first place. " for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God..." The world is in sin. The world DOES NOT HAVE GOOD PEOPLE!! Only by the grace of God, through faith in Jesus Christ you are made righteous. I beg you in the name of Jesus Christ to stay away from this book. It hasnt helped 4 million people, but it lied to them. Kusher, please turn from your ways and come to Jesus, then will you understand the life question "WHY"
When Foxfire first came out, I had no interest to watch it at all. Recently I became a huge Angelina Jolie fan. The main reason to watch the movie was her. Jolie is great as usual. She gives everything into her character and is very good. The reason that films like these don't get as much publicity as their male counterparts is because they are all are so stereotyped and labeled. And while the generalization about most "female bonding" films is true, the same could be said about the men. And what makes each film stand apart is the emotion and ideas of the characters. The plot is based on real life situations, and the characters and the charisma they deliver is what makes the film so liberating and exciting to watch. The girls are learning life lessons, growing up, experimenting, facing hard issues and learning to cope and understand each other.  ---  --- Angelina Jolie has some brilliant lines and poses as an almost Mother-like figure, affecting their lives forever, sheltering and explaining, and persuading the girls to take an extra risk, or risks, rather. It's very intimate and she does an incredible job playing "Legs". It isn't meant to represent what all girls do, and don't bother looking for a movie about lesbians guys. It gets very ethereal at points and made a point about bonding and unity. Don't bother looking for deep intellectual comments either, because the most poignant scenes are sullen and the actresses use their eyes over words.  ---  --- The opening scenes are good, the way they introduce the oppressed victims, and you see the wide-eyed looks as are often given by people who are afraid - but who will later look for comfort in Legs and her new-found posse. It is all set up very well. And the touching ending scenes provide closure, showing how very real, and sincere, everything has been. It's not sugar coated in any way and let's you take a glimpse into a female perspective that does not revolve around whether or not they have a boyfriend, and whether their hair and make-up look okay. And if at least 1 girl can watch a movie like that, or read a book like that, and be inspired enough to raise her self-esteem and not let anyone walk over her, then it has made a good impact. After all, it's simply not often movies about self-proclaiming girls rebelling get in this much of a spotlight, right?
I bought this shaver about one year ago. For years I was using Braun shavers and was happy with them but decided to try competition. In spite of few people on internet who mentioned short lifespan I gave Panasonic a try. ---  --- Shaving is fine, it runs quiet and you get 5-7 shaves with one charge.  After about one year it started making strange noise and you get only 3-4 shaves with one recharge. Month later slowly went dead. Exactly as some other people wrote on bulletin boards, what make me to believe to those people writing reviews.  ---  --- You would expect more shave for $100. Today I went to buy Braun shaver.
The performance given by Poitier will not dissappoint. This movie version of the play is done from the view point of the son as oppossed to the view point of the mother, Lena. This work is timeless
I took Passion RX because I am 31 years old and have a very low sex drive and no passion. I had great success the first week I took this product. In fact I was so pleased, I bought 2 more bottles. However, the second week, I went back to having no sex drive. And even though I am continuing to take Passion RX, it has not had any effect whatsoever since the first week.  I take 2 pills each day in the morning, and have done so for over a month.  I suppose everyone is different but I won't purchase any more. Plus I just saw a webpage from Consumer Health Digest that gives it low rating compared to other products: http://consumerhealthdigest.com/top25female.htm?source=overute/Passionrx&OVRAW=passion%20rx&OVKEY=passion%20rx&OVMTC=standar
I am amazed. My mom sent this to me after I'd complained about already being eaten alive by mosquitos this year. I don't just get bites; I get huge, oddly shaped, so-itchy-they're-almost-painful, welts. And I am that person who attracts every single biting insect. I have often wished that I sweated DEET. However, I don't. ---  --- I tried this dubiously, first in the morning--I'd been getting bites every day between 8 and 10am (even with high % deet). --No bites.-- I still didn't believe it. I used it again that evening--after a rainstorm had come through--from about 6pm to 10pm. No bites! It comes with a belt clip, but I left it outside at one point when I came inside. The second I left its side, a mosquito landed on me. ---  --- I have, since then, used it several more times, no insect spray at all, and it's been very muggy around here. Absolutely no bites. I have seen a couple more bees than usual, and it turns out that the ingredient this blows out (geraniol) is said to attract bees. Not a big deal to me. ---  --- It apparently doesn't work for everyone. I have always assumed that there is some sort of chemical I give off that makes mosquitos head straight for me, bypassing everyone else. (I might be at a party where no one else even sees a mosquito and I leave with over a dozen bites.) I wonder if the geraniol somehow combines with whatever it is that I put out and neutralizes it. This could explain why it would work for some people and not other people. ---  --- At this price, it's worth it to find out if you are one of the people for whom it might work! I figure if I replace the cartridge every 2 weeks (~$3.50/cartridge), I will even be saving money because I'd been going through 1-2 cans of high-deet bug spray per week
Whatever product Sony brings to the market, you can always be sure that you are buying a Top Quality Product, and these sony memory card for PS2 is just the perfect exampl
We ordered the double stroller because it had really good reviews and it sounded like it would fit us perefctly. --- Our children are 2.5 and 10 months.  Our 2 year old has almost outgrown the back as her head is higher than the back support.  Also with in 6 months we had two different stollers because both has issues with the rain shield,and peek a boo window cracking, also the black out line seam came apart from the red fabric.  The kickers was when we pick up our stroller from from the airport in Mexico and the latch mechanism gave away when  my two kids were in it.  It cloapsed because the locking system melted..... oops, I guess someone forgot to check that on part of the test!!
Ok good CD. im not suprised. Ok jaheim may not have the b best voice but his music is good and it goes will with the voice that he has.  Yes yall this album does use profanity but the songs actually have meanings. I like that daddy thing song, and like a dj. This album looks at issues from a mans  point of view. Ya know we've heard the angry woman and how the man did t his and that now jaheim looks at it from a males view. Ok yall i know he is not the first one to do this but he did it well. Also this is a break from that [...] that is played on the radio.
Good quality. Beautiful color. However had a side zipper which my husband didn't like as much as a top zipper
My 13 yr old wanted this and a waveboard for Christmas.  Since his dad and I are divorced, he ended up with both.  I got him the flowboard and he LOVES it.  Of course, I tried it too and was shocked to find it was actually easier for me to play with than his regular skateboard.  There is no chance I'm even going to try the waveboard, as I do value my intact bones.  I've been wanting to learn how to snowboard and this definitely gives the feeling of snowboarding, but without the snow!  It's well made, fun and definitely a hit
WOW! I couldnt believe that they actually made a hitch for my sports car. The car manual said that it is not possible to put a hitch on the RX8, but I really wanted one to accomodate my hitch bike rack. I ordered this one and it fit perfectly - in fact the holes in the hitch mounting bar lined up with holes already in the car frame, like the car was designed to accept this hitch! It only took me about one hour to install - didnt even have to remove the tires or jack the car up! Very easy installation
This figure is one of the best in the marvel legends series. I have over forty of the marvel legends figures and this is the tallest. The hair on his body looks real and his joints aren't to tight, but not to lose either their just right. I couldn't wait for them to release more Exiles members like Noctourne, Blink, Morph, & Mimic. I wasn't very happy to see the marvel legends series coming to an end with the seperation of marvel from Toy Biz the last series are going to be realeased later this year. I'm glad to see Psylocke & Falcon before the series end, but what about the wildly popular She Hulk. They've got the loser Sabertooth from the Exiles coming out, but not She Hulk. If you're going to bring an Exiles to the series at least bring characters we like. NOCTOURNE, MORPH, BLINK, MIMIC!!!! 
I really like this cd a lot and I am looking forward to seeing them live
people say that the iquest stinks because it doesn't have all their text books. but i honestly think that even though it may be a little different, there's no harm in learning new things.
Buy the Baby Bjorn before you waste your time and money on this hunk of junk.  No matter how I tried, I couldn't wrap my baby to where I felt he was secure and safe and comfortable.  Plus, it took forever and my baby had no patience to wait for me.  By the time he was in, he wanted out
QBQ! by John Miller is simply amazing. This little book is a grand slam all the way! QBQ strips away all the excuses and reminds us again where it is the buck is supposed to stop. If you're looking for an instruction manaual for leaders, here it is. People don't need tricks, methods, myths or secrets...what they really need is a tool that helps them step up to the plate and be accountable for their own results. One of the biggest weaknesses of the American workforce is the ability to accept responsibility and accountability for our own actions.   Bravo for QBQ
I didn't use this particular product but the version that came with my computer which was slow but not the end of the world. The problem I had with them is that they aoutomatically renew your subscription without giving any warning that they are going to do it. I had a 2-year subscription and they send me an e-mail 2 years later saying they charged my account with never telling me that I was in auto enrollment! When I called to complain they of course had someone who couldn't inderstand me and I had to spell my e-mail address THREE times and was told it would take 3-5 days for the refund to be processed which is crap because I work for an online store and its easier to void a sale and cheaper for the vendor to do a refund the same day! I asked for a manager TWICE, the second time they came back they had the nerve to ask me if I was interested in an upgrade and subscribing to their magazine, and was put on the never-ending hold until I gave up 37 minutes later which was probably the plan all along. SO I called my bank and put a stop payment on the automatic payment. Now I am searching for another protection program and calling their customer service before my purchase to see how it goes
If I could give it a zero or negative rating I would.  When VIBE was introduced, it was a relevant, interesting magazine that exposed me to new alternative, r&b and hip hop artists.  The mag featured all kinds of artists not just who's hot right now, it also featured hard hitting expose articles that were relevant to not only the hip hop community but the world. ---  --- Lately I've noticed that it's nothing more than a fluffy version of The Source.  I hate a lot of new rap music that's out and didn't appreciate mags with rappers I dislike on the cover. And is it me or does it seem like since Mimi took over, all of the female r&b singers' covers and stories are HORRIBLE (we won't even discuss that disgusting Brandy cover)! ---  --- This magazine SUCKS now and the only time I check it out is while I'm in line at the grocery store.  Yes, the subscription rates are cut to the bone now but that is because the quality is supremely lacking.  I'd advise the curious to check issues out at newstands or where ever before wasting your hard earned money on a subscription
NO eye piece cover - you put your eye on a hard surface --- hard to focus --- hard to find objects --- I lost a pair similar to these that were much better
IT was advertised and NOT IN STOCK so I was unable to get it
We were extremely disappointed with this toy that we bought as a Christmas present for our four year old son.  The parking garage came with pre-drilled holes and needed to be assumbled.  Unfortunately, due to poor quality, the pieces did not line up correctly and we needed to sand some of them down in order to make the toy functional.  It would also have been helpful for the manufacturer to include one or two spare screws in case they got lost or destroyed during assembly. 
I do like this t-shirt.  I liked the organic cotton and the general style.  But I will never buy American Apparel again.  Not only are they VERY labor and union unfriendly, their ads exploitive of young girls (I mean, I can tolerate some of the young models in general, but these are particularly young girls in amature porn-looking situations), but a friend's daughter had a particularly unsavory experience working in one of their stores.   ---  --- I know I can find a cosy organic shirt elsewhere.  ick
I ordered this brand because it had the least amount of sugar. --- The cherries were gritty (dirty?, sand?) and did not have the tart taste of locally purchased dried cherries.  Now I'm stuck with a whole box of them that no one in my family wants to eat
If you don't need outlook but do need powerpoint, this is a great value.  Before, you had to be a student or teacher to get a good price (full retail $150 now).  Office 2003 standard even on eBay is still going for $175 plus.  This does not offer anything much beyond Office 2003 but the new ribbon format is not difficult to learn.  Also, don't worry about file formats.  You can re-set the default format to prior formats so that anything you send out can be read by earlier versions of Microsoft Office. 
I have never written a review like this before but felt compelled to do so in this case. Those considering purchase of this printer should be aware that the claim that it will work with pict bridge connections is NOT true. I purchased this for my wife thinking that it would be a nice compact simple printer to operate where we could easily print pictures of the grandkids. She and I both have newer Nikon digitals and the pictbridge connection will not work with mine at all. With hers, we can make a connection and, following drections carefully, we can get it to 'energize' the printer but the printer will only print intermittent photos and not of good quality. The printer will not pull the paper though properly. (We have even changed batteries in the camera to no avail and had a tech savvy son-in-law look at it.) I read reviews by others, but feel this printer is simply not reliable. I wanted to share our bad experience with those of you evauating a purchase. ---  --- In my opinion, Canon should be more forthcoming with claims about interface with other cameras. I'm in the process of trying to return it to Amazon. We're going to buy an HP, which I should have done initially. ---  --- Thank you
people this is easy listening at it's easiest. Every song is and will be a candidate for adult contemperary rotation in 2 years, that is if it isn't allready. I don't know anything about what they have done in the past, except for a song I remember being played on the radio a few years ago. Must have been on the album prior to this. But that song sounds just like two tracks on this one. Not only that but if there wasn't a pause in between these mini mediocre fests I couldn't really tell any of them apart. Horrible music with no feeling or soul, not even creative. don't waste your time with this.
We got this in lieu of another similar one because it was in stock, but lo and behold it only lasted a week. Our son lays on his back and kicks everything in his crib, so when he kicked this, the knob securing it to the crib through the strap broke off. Luckily the broken piece fell on the floor and not into his crib, where it could have posed a choking hazard! Pass on this and get a Fisher Price one - Ocean Wonders or the one we got, Flutterbye Dreams, which he loves
This weight bench is too short and is almost impossible to use in a completely horizontal postion. You would have to be a little kid for it to work. After working along time to put it together I found neither me nor my 6'2" kid could use it effectively
The product came well-packaged and unopened. I really needed instructions on how to open the packaging. But once I got it opened and installed, the product works as well as promised. The set-up and ribbon menu is a lot more user-friendly than 2003. I downloaded the trial version that Microsoft had offered, and I must say that this is the best Office product offered by Microsoft to date
For the last 15 years I have been a manual razor user.  I decided to try an electric razor and after researching found the Norelco 7745X to be just what I wanted.  I can say that I am glad I did.  It is very quiet and the lotion dispenser definitely makes shaving a joy
Christmas morning, my daughter tears the paper off this toy and is soooo exited. What a disapointment. Nothing I did caused the tail to wag, the leg to move and no licking action. I changed the batteries, still nothing. After hours of trying to get it to work, I went on line here and read somebody elses review about rubbing under the collar VERY HARD. Finally, the tail wagged, the foot moved and then, it actually licked. What a piece of work, very cute but WAY too much work. In time, I will eventually rub all the fur off under the collar. Save your money
If you want your child to know the true & Bibical account of Jesus' birth...the shepherds came first! --- An angel announced His birth the shepherds hurried to see Mary, Joseph & baby Jesus. --- They were first on the scene. Some chronicle the kings coming as much as three years later. --- I will return my three sets & order the one with the bells & whistles AND two shepherds!!
Boring, tasteless and unoriginal. Photographer has an obvious fixation...which has kept him from paying attention in many cases to contrast, tone, and line. One star for the big you know what, the real model here. I'm sure book has its merits, but they aren't artistic. Putting my copy up for sale
I wanted it for my collection, however you can sift through all the youtube stuff and end up with the same video for free if you want to do the work
Expensive, but a small amount makes a big difference. Excellent conditioner for dry, thick hair. Also, very pleasing fragrance. The best hair treatment I've found for my straight, coarse, dry hair. Highly recommended
I was deeply dissapointed in this lens hood.  Given that the cost is about 10% of the cost of the lens for which it was intended (the 70-300 IS in this case) I expected it to be of stiff durable polycarbonate.  ---  --- -Positives- --- fulfills the basic function of a lens hood- prevents flare, etc. ---  --- The bayonet locking system is excellent, much easier to deal with than scew-on type lens hoods. ---  --- that's about it. ---  --- -Negatives- --- The polycarbonate is so thin I half expect it to be translucent. ---  --- The hood must be gripped by the base to remove it, as grippng the thin end of the hood may break it; or at least it feels like it may break it. ---  --- Its very long.  Especially on the 70-300 which is already a long lens, this makes a fully extended zoom about a foot long.  That's pretty conspicuous. ---  --- It's very overpriced vs. generic lenses ($50 vs. $5-10 for rubber or metal). ---  ---  --- I traded it in and went with a kalt rubber lens hood.  2 stars for the great bayonet design, but the rest of it is weak
I bought the 3.5 x 5.5 ruled pocket version. By my standards, the best notebook I've ever used. The perfect size for my jacket or pocket. Acid free paper for long-term archival storage of my notes. Good to use an acid free ink for even longer storage (gel ink pens do not work well with the Moleskine's paper though). Looks professional, and I get a lot of nice comments about it. Much easier to use than turning on my PDA and slowly typing in notes with my thumbs. I also really like the fact that it will open completely flat on a table for easier note writing and reading. When this one is full, I plan to buy another. Price is higher than most, but with this Moleskine, you pay for the quality
The oil must be removed through the oil drain to properly evacuate the contaminated oil from the crank case. And the oil filter must be replaced to prevent contamination of the new oil.  ---  --- Maybe you'll find this product wonderful and a cost-effective alternative, what do you do with the oil syphoned from the engine? A small but important cost of the oil change at a garage is for disposal of the oil.
Let me first say that I did not purchase this mini stepper through Amazon, but rather directly from the Discovery Channel Store. Two weeks after I submitted my review of their product on their web site, however, they still have not seen fit to post it. ---  --- I used the Discovery Electronic Mini Stepper daily for 29 days (30 minutes per day) before the cable around the pulley-wheel broke. This seems to be a consistent problem with this piece of equipment, judging by previous reviews on the DCS (Discover Channel Store) web site. Being inside the 30 day return window, I sent my stepper back for a refund. Customer service, I must say, was excellent...only the product itself was cheap and substandard. ---  --- On a related note, this is the third mini stepper (various brands, not all DCS) I have owned in the past year. They have all broken down in one way or another. Feel free to look at some of my previous reviews here to get the details, but the bottom line is that this will be my last mini stepper. ---  --- Take some advice from me when I say that these machines are built for people who are beginners in the world of fitness. That is to say, if you intend to use a mini stepper two or three days per week for 15-20 minutes, then you may be satisfied with one. However, if you are at an advanced or even intermediate stage in your workout routine, then don't even consider one of these machines - you will destroy it, trust me. There's just too much that can go wrong -- pulleys cracking, pulley cables breaking, shocks leaking...and I actually broke the frame of one stepper. Through all of this, I have learned one important lesson about exercise: keep it simple. I am now having great success with some simple resistance bands (many varieties are available here at Amazon) and cardiovascular exercises (e.g. regular old jumping-jacks). I get a better workout than any I ever got from a mini stepper, and I'm feeling great and even lost a little weight in the right places :-) ---  --- Honestly, if you want to save yourself some grief, please learn from my experiences and avoid the horrible cycle of mini stepper destruction. Just buy yourself some resistance bands, maybe a jump rope, an exercise mat, an instructional video/book, and then get to work. Exercising to tone your body and lose weight isn't easy (and if it is, then you're probably not doing it right), but you can make it easier by not wasting your time and money on junk like this
What a joke, not worth the money. I put it in the container to pull out the oil and it dies half way through. Swapped batteries, pulled it out, washed it and looked at all the parts. It was either used and resold to me by amazon, or it was defective from the start. And since they have a 30 day return policy, I am now stuck with it, I will see what eastman says next. VERY disappointing, I will go back to the old way of just pouring it into a funnel with a coffee filter in it
I bought Bead Fantasies and Bead Fantasies II at the same time after reading the positive reviews; I wish I had looked at these books before buying. There are pretty motifs that I will incorporate into my beading projects but I find the small typed directions overly simplistic and the diagrams are too small. I'm glad this isn't my first beading book or I would feel totally discouraged from trying any of these projects. I won't be buying Bead Fantasies III.  The Art and Elegance of Beadweaving and Coraling Technique remain my favorite beading books. --- 
Polanyi sets forth an incredibly relevant, radical, and all too plausible theory in this book. ---  --- Going beyond a mere analysis of how the market system functions, Polanyi endeavors to answer the question as to how the market came about. Polanyi's answer will not be pleasing to libertarians, he argues that a free land and labor market can only come about through government intervention, and must be sustained through further intervention. He also argues that the market ransforms the nature of social relations. Usually, economic relations were a result of social relations, under the market, it is the latter. ---  --- Polanyi attempts to show how a market for land and labor came about in Britain. His argument that government "enclosures" created it through dislodging the poor and turning their land into sources of economic production is convincing. However, other arguments Polanyi advances simply demonstrate a central government repealing the interventions of subaltern governments. ---  --- Polanyi's argument that there was no "rent-seeking" (he doesn't use that term) involved in the enactment of state intervion in the economy ("proving" that this intervention was objectively necessary is suspect. One 19th century investigators conclusions don't serve to overturn the implications of public choice theory. ---  --- The greatest problem with this book is that Polanyi doesn't do too much to back up his arguments. He fortunately has a section called "notes and sources" where he lists his research material, but I'd wager that most of this is difficult to find 60 years later
I was very hesitant to purchase this bike because of all the problems other people reported with parts coming damaged/rusty. The only problem I had was the bar on the rear-bottom wouldn't fit all the way into the slot to put one of the screws in. I tried really hard to get it in, but it just wouldn't budge. Luckily, I could get the screw in on the other end, so it is relatively secure.  --- The bike is a bit wobbly when your riding - now I don't know if this is because of my problem with the bar, or because that's just the way it is. but I don't feel like it's going to fall apart or tip over or anything. --- Over all, this is a really nice bike. The price is absolutely the best for what you're getting - especially if you choose the free super saver shipping. I got mine about a week from the day I ordered it. I don't think you will find another bike comparable to this for the price. Most recumbent bikes at this price don't offer any kind of resistance, what to speak of programs or the pulse monitor.  --- It is really quiet - I can do it at 5 in the morning while my daughter is sleeping in the next room and not have to turn the TV up too loud. The seat is a bit uncomfortable, but it's not that big of a deal considering the price
I used it in Brasil and had it developed.  I was very happy with it.  It was the very first time I've used a digital camera
This are excellent and I can dry my SUV with all three easily.  After a few wrings with each towel they begin to get too wet to dry efficiently.  I definitely recommend it for the DIY car detailers
Had this set of speakers for close to a year now. They really are nothing special for the price. ONE problem is when running them on battery the signal seems to drift (if you lock in a signal at all)! They do come with power cord to plug each speaker into AC. I have outside wiring so this is no trouble. TWO if you walk between the transmitter and the speeakers the music cuts out.If you plan to buy these and run them on battery alone, and mounting them in a high traffic area (I mounted mine high above head level), DON'T PURCHASE THEM
As a beef eating Hindu I am very much interested in finding how cows became holy for Hindus and beef a forbidden thing to eat. I browsed through this book in a book store and found it to be very disappointing. ---  --- First, it appeared to be intended more for creating controversy than for informational purposes. It clearly had a bias which turned me off. ---  --- Second, I am generally up-to date on current issues and remembered that it did not generate all that controversy as mentioned on the cover of the book. There were some rumblings but nothing of the sort described on the covers ("the government of India demands be ritually burned"). ---  --- Later I searched on google with the book title and words "ban", "government of India" and found no news reports relating any government of India attempts at banning this book. There were no reports on ban by Allahabad High Court either. All I found were book reviews on the book and other articles written mainly by political commentators known for their leftist opinions.  ---  --- Third, I found some material on internet on how the author misinterpreted much of the scriptures to support his conclusions. ---  --- It basically left me disappointed and I am still searching for some reliable and accurate material on this matter. --- 
The chocolate war ---  --- The chocolate war was one of the best books I have ever read...NOT! The chocolate war portrayed a very inappropriate scene. The boy jerry was supposed to sell chocolates but refused, but the book sidetracks and talks about naughty things and also swears a lot. I would not recommend this book because it seemed inappropriate. I don't think that this book should be available to children at a middle school level. This story might be better if the bad words and other bad things war taken out. I think that the story line seems great when jerry denies selling the chocolates because of Archie. Archie is a suspicious character that knows every one. I wish this book was more school appropriate, but it isn't and was a horrid book. Therefore, this book would be great if the author published a book with the Sam story but more school appropriate situations and words
These are very nice quality and comfortable. Everything was as expected and came in just a few days
The problem with Computer Shopper is, it's neither a serious trade magazine like PC Mag, or a shopper's paradise like its former self was.  If you want hardware tips, Maximum PC is way better.  You can find pretty much everything in Computer Shopper for free on the web ..
So delicious and so healthy.  Fresh and crunchy - much better than peanuts.  I love these soy nuts
I was very happy with the previous model DSC-N1, which took very nice pictures just with pointing and shooting. But this one, while I only had chance to use it indoors and outdoor in raining weather, it really disappointed me. The pictures are always blured due to too much exposure, I used auto flash, for which the camera should takes nice pictures as it  is a point and shoot camera and it is 10.1MP!  ---  --- I'm going to try more when the weather gets better but most possible I will return it, I just can't accept the quality of the indoor pictures it takes. I doubt I was unlucky and got a bad one, I can't believe a 10.1MP sony camera takes so poor pictures. And after reading the previous review about the terrible Sony custmer servce, I decide I will avoid Sony customer service, and the camera will just be returned.   ---  --- Note: Found the review by Cecelia Choy "cece" on March 13, 2007 mentioned the same problem I had. I didn't have this problem with my previous model DSC-N1.  ---  --- April 17, 2006: I bought a new one and it takes nice pictures now! Suggestion for those having the same problem I had before -- exchange for another one!!
Though still not quite enough battery for the juice-sucking Q, it is worlds better than the included battery.  I would love to see a clip on the back to attach the original battery as well to swap when the extended one dies
If you don't use this phone, it costs $3/month.  Normal hours til 9 p.m. it's 12 cents per minute, which is a bit less than half of what most prepaid phones cost.  Perfect for my occasional use and for locating family members when I'm in transit and feel that I simply must know where they are and what they are doing.  I don't use cell phones much, but if I must have one, I might as well have one that doesn't make me worry about another huge bill.  For kids who think they can mangle the budget, forget it cuz when the card is used up -- that's it kiddo.  Once they use up the card, the only number they can dial is 911, but that's it.  Bonus features: clock is always accurate and it has a great alarm which tells me when to get up to go to work and another to tell me when to go home at the end of the day.  At some point, I might not be able to live without this. 
I actually got the Snug Tub Deluxe.  This version comes with inflatable rings that baby can stack on the inflatable post.  It also has an attached inflatable fish that wheezes when you squeeze it.  I used it for the first time tonight and my 6 month old baby enjoyed the freedom to splash and play.  My only caution is to use something to keep baby from slipping.  I put her baby sponge underneath her to elevate her and propr her up.  This was also good to lean her back to wash her hair and to keep her from slipping.  I'm glad I bought this instead of the EuroBath
This mag is for people who think they are computer experts because they can change out a video card or follow directions on changing an OS setting. ---  --- Shallow coverage, and some of the lamest humor you will ever come across. ---  --- It is nothing more then a rehash of what is freely and easily available on the internet. There is nothing original in this mag, ever. Also it tends to copy and paste much of the issue from 12 months earlier. All the main articles are nearly the same every 12 months. Don't believe me? Take two magazines that are 12 months apart and compare them. ---  --- The reviews are also weak. nearly every month you will see: THE FASTEST SYSTEM WE EVER TESTED!!!!! YAAAAAWWWWWWNNNNN. Who cares? Anyone who knows even the slightest about computers knows that speed is not the most important attribute, even for gamers. Besides, does it really matter that system y is .00005% faster on their poor testing system then computer z? ---  --- The second star is for Mr Halfhills column. It is the only part that is consistantly interesting and the only person there with real technical know-how. ---  --- Read toms hardware and whatever tech news you want, learn how to use search engines, and skip this pointless mag
This works pretty well to get back and forth between classes, although you can tell that it's a toy at heart. If you're looking for something fun and easy, I recommend this scooter
i've used this cream for years.  i like the way it feels and makes my skin look.  i'd recommend it to anyone. 
I love this item.  We bought 2 cases for our sons before we left for vacation.  It can hang from the seats but they just held them on their lap or layed it on the couch in the van.  The boys arranged everything in the case so the battery even fits in it.  I was glad about that.  I'd recommend this item.
This is another wierd book by Shirley MacLaine: it is neither interesting nor a helpful guide book for pilgrims. The book is just a long rambling new age rant, published because the auther is "Shirley MacLaine".  Too bad really. Don't waste your money on this one.
A time saver.  Slap in on while still wet right after your shower; instant moisturization if you've got to jump in, jump out, and go.  And it smells delicious
Once you get used to all of the keys being flat, it plays well.  I like to put it in my backpack to take to school, or to play in the park
Tastes just like the red curries you get at a Thai Restaurant.  Add more or less depending on your spice level.  Not salty at all.  Flavor is great.  Mix with some vegetables, tofu, and coconut milk to make an amazing Thai meal at home
Okami rates among the most beautiful games I've ever seen.   ---  --- The main point of the game is that you're the reincarnation of a god, awakened after a hundred years to dispatch of the evil that's overtaken the land. The entire landscape is bleak and dead--affected by the evil, and it's your task to both fight the ultimate evil, and restore the land using various techniques you learn throughout the game.  ---  --- One of the really interesting aspects of the game is that, since the main character is folk tale diety (in the form of a wolf), the player can affect the environment of the game by drawing with a calligraphy brush. A circle stroke in the sky creates a sun to turn night into day. Another stroke across a dead tree brings it bursting into full bloom. A slashing stroke across your enemies cuts them.  ---  --- My only minor complaint so far is that perhaps it does a little too much shepherding in terms of letting you know where to go next. However, this doesn't detract for the game overall. At the same time, the player does have a good deal of freedom--I haven't felt railroaded through the storyline at all.  Perhaps the extra guidance will make this game more accessible also for people who aren't usually gamers.   ---  --- If you're looking for something visually interesting, occasionally humorous, and with very different gameplay from the usual fare, Okami is highly recommended. 
Dont dwnld " Survivor, "Thunderstorms & Sacrifice" ". Its my fault for not reading the whole thing. you would think that the last episode would be the finale , but NO, its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4. I didnt even get a full 45 minute episode. No finale. I got rippped off. $1.99 dwnld not well spent. Dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending. Because they dont have that episode, not even the reunion show
ah... ---  --- um... ---  --- well, my brother picked this up not too long ago, and , well... --- it sucks! it's the WORST of the whole series! --- i thought it would have to do with the mask Michael wears in the others, but not a FICKEN THING!!!!!!!!!!!! ---  --- I gave it two stars because i liked the killing scene in the hospital, but then i took one because of how bad the rest was..
These pods perform poorly in my espresso machine while ground beans perform very well. It could be the filter for the pods but the espresso comes out uneven from the spouts and the flavor is not very strong
We got this for our 21-month-old boy, who LOVES music and was always trying to play his dad's guitars. It is the perfect size and looks just like his daddy's black accoustic. He absolutely loves it. The manufacturers were smart and put the tuning keys on the bottom of the neck, as not to draw too much attention (which helps maintain the life of the strings). My only complaint is that the bridge is not secured so it is always coming lose and falling into the body of the guitar. I keep intedning to superglue it on...Otherwise I think this is a great toy for toddlers who are into music.
IN A NUTSHELL: FAST - IDIOT PROOF - MADE FOR ON THE GO - 5 CALORIES ---  --- This is really a very handy way to have a refreshing drink ready to go when water is just too bland, by itself. ---  --- Just open the packet, empty the contents into a bottle of water [how much H2O according to your taste] and shake it up. Viola -- refreshment in an instant. Or, you can put the bottle [plastic] in the freezer and have an ice-cold lemonade later. ---  --- WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT -- ---  --- 'Crystal Light On The Go Packets Lemonade, Drink Mix' tastes great, has very few calories, is an ideal carbonated beverage alternative and most of all --- IT'S EZ TO MAKE ON THE GO - FAST. It's also rather reasonably priced. ---  --- MY ONLY RESERVATION -- ASPARTAME ---  --- Some people do have bad reactions to aspartame but most people know, by now, whether or not it affects them adversely. I would rather have 'Splenda' as the sweetener, but maybe that will be available soon. ---  --- Through Kraft, there is a neat website which contains nutritional and other info about Crystal Light -  [http://www.kraftfoods.com/CRYSTALLIGHT/] ---  ---  --- [I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY] ---  ---   --- 
Jeff Buckley sounds like what Marc Bolan would have sounded like if Bolan had taken Perry Como as his musical muse.  Seriously, think about Marc Bolan trying to sound like a '50's crooner and you'll know what Jeff Buckley sounds like
I absolutely am addicted to these.  I was taking Lipitor for my cholestrol and couldn't have pink grapefruit juice or eat pink grapefruit, which I absolutely love.  But these satisfied my craving for it completely plus it didn't interfere with the meds!  I brought the bag to work and put them in my candy jar on my desk and have gotten several other people hooked on them! They're the best
The band is excellent and this album is just shy of the high quality of the first.  However, the encroachment of our free use rights as legal consumers by the major record companies will not stop until they see a negative financial impact from pushing these copy crippled products. Don't support these products
The chair has simple pre-set programs (I basically use only the full-body massage), but also allows for designing your own massage by choosing specific movements and massage area.  ---  --- Of course it is not the same as a real massage and not as good as the $2,500 chairs, but offers a great way to relax your back muscles at a great value
Just started introducing the potty to my 19 month old and he loves to sit on it and "practice". So far so good......
I bought the DVD based on all the positive reviews, and I think prospective buyers should be warned that not everyone finds this a 5-star movie.  My husband and I, who love old movies, hated it.  My teenagers just found it completely uninteresting.  It was apparently made about the time Alaska became a state, although it deals with an earlier time period, and the movie has not aged well.  The story was uninteresting, the direction was uneven, the comedy (mostly bar fights) felt forced and awkward.  Stewart Granger did not seem to know what he was doing or why his character was there.  Fabian's acting was unmemorable and we felt Capucine was miscast.  We got bored and spent half the movie pointing out to each other how little the sandy beaches and desert terrain looked anything like Alaska (it was obviously shot in southern California).  I gave it two stars because I was able to sit through the entire thing, but I spent most of it asking myself "why?  Why am I wasting my time like this?
This little toy is cute. My 11 month old son LOVES BLues Clues and loves this toy. He will hold him on his lap while he watches his favorite show! Its really cute
Contrary to the product description, this stool is not heavy duty! The actual seat itself is made of very flimsy plywood, and any sort of bad posture or leaning forward will crack it and punch the metal supports through it! ---  --- The legs are also hard to adjust to optimum length, as the retention screw doesn't hold anything in place for long. If you can find something somewhere else, I say go for it
I read some of the other reviews before I submitted this.  I don't see how someone could get upset over the liner notes.  Redd doesn't include Danny Gatton as an influence because he didn't listen to him.  As far as other reviews concerning tone and the lack of fire, well, I don't even know how to address that.  Redd has one of the best tones I've heard on the tele and his note selection is what sets him apart from other pickers.  Ever hear of diarrhea of the guitar?  Well, you won't get that on this CD because Redd doesn't play something to just play it.  This CD showcases Redd's versatility from country, to swing, to blues, to rock, it has it all.  If you like good pickin', then by this CD
I bought the KR Party bundle for my boyfriend's daughter for her birthday. She loves the game, but it has only been about two weeks and the mic is dead. It started with the static for a while, but then while I was singing, it just died completely. I know I'm not a great singer, but I'm not THAT bad
I saw this movie for one reason: I wanted to see Gerard Butler in something other than Phantom Of The Opera just to see how he played a "normal" role. I've never been a big fan of "chick flicks" (for instance, my friend and I watched A Walk To Remember awhile ago, and the only thing that kept us from laughing throughout was the constant threat of being slapped by one of the girls in the room). That said, Dear Frankie is a thoroughly entertaining film that has a surprisingly deep plot and keeps going at a fast enough pace that you never get bored. Initially I had trouble understanding what the actors were saying (they all have thick accents), but once I got used to it I had no problems through the rest of the movie
Dull and uninspiring, listening to this CD I couldn't see what distinguished the Doves from the other insipid sound-a-like bands that plague the modern music scene. If you like The White Stripes, Franz Ferdinand, Arctic Monkeys, The Killers then be grateful that they've saved rock music from boring dross like this
I bought this game for an adult birthday party. It was a hit.   --- The game is very entertaining and it is easy to navigate through the game.  You have full control of the settings such as music level, vocals, crowd noise, etc.  You can also change the mode to the traditional Karaoke in which only the words are displayed on the screen. It's definitely for all ages even my two year old can't get enough of it. The selection of music is good. Be sure to have a memory card so you can save any characters you create and keep track of your performance for unlock hidden treasures such as extra songs and wardrobes
Was a subsciber for many years mainly due to extremely balanced reporting, indepth coverage, etc.  Then, starting about 1-2 years ago, the magazine started to take a "left" tilt.  (I do not consider myself "right wing", am registered as an independant, but do like fair balanced coverage in my news)  Since the beginning of this decline, the Atlantic has become more and more just another liberal magazine.  The bias has also led, as it always does, to less in-depth reporting, since they tend to now ignore any aspect of an issue that does not support the left bent.
These underpants are too bulky and puffy. My daughter was very uncomfortable wearing them
I've been a subscriber since right before the days of Bel Ami. I've never regretted a single issue, nor the investment.
I received this chair very quickly, even though it was close to Christmas. The chair was wonderful! Such a great price for such a great chair
I purchased this card a month ago. I use it on my Dell Axim X3i. So far it has been fully compatible, fast, and flawless. I haven't owned another PDA or SD card so I can't give you a first-hand benchmark. But I can say that accessing the card is quick and I have not had any skips while playing my music files. The 256MB is good for the price if you wait for Amazon to drop their price in conjunction with the manufacturer's rebate
DeYoung begins by relating how Bush pushed Powell out at the end of his 1st term, without the courtesy of even personally discussing it with him; making matters worse was the  fact that Bush didn't even know why Powell was at the White House when it came time to say "Good Bye." ---  --- Colin Powell came from Jamaican parents (often called "Jewmaicans" by American Negroes because of the emphasis they placed on hard work and education), and during his early life in the NYC area suffered little, if any, racial prejudice.  Later on, unfortunately, the insults were quite aggravating, but Powell was determined to not let them inhibit his performance. ---  --- Powell was an indifferent student in high school and at CCNY (majored in geology); however, ROTC piqued his sophomore-year interest and he soon became a standout.  Powell went on to be selected outstanding cadet, and top graduate (or very close) in every military training setting he undertook, as well as a top MBA student at George Washington University.  He also was top-ranked by superiors in almost every military assignment, leading to his being offered a White House fellowship, which in turn provided Powell with travel to Russia and China and brought him in contact with a number of influential people who were impressed enough to forward Powell onto Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, National Security Advisor, and Secretary of State. ---  --- One of Powell's "secrets of success" was to enthusiastically implement all orders, even those he considered silly - Powell himself believed that doing otherwise grounded the careers of many talented others. ---  --- Unfortunately, Powell eventually crossed paths with Dick Cheney (a bit of a problem during Gulf War I; a serious problem when Cheney became V.P.).  Between Cheney's far-right bias ("out on the looney fringe" - per Powell) and Bush II's "disturbingly disjointed" decision-making - per Treasury Secretary O'Neill), Powell's contributions as Secretary of State were severely limited and constantly undermined and countermanded - often with Don Rumsfeld's help.  In addition, he was often left out of important decisions, especially when out of the country.  Ultimately, Powell's credibility suffered from the inaccurate information provided in his U.N. speech attesting to Saddam's WMD. ---  --- The big question, still debated, is "Why didn't he resign?"  His supporters believe the reason is that Powell's nature simply didn't allow anything less than 100% support. ---  --- Bottom Line:  If Cheney had not been such an ideologue (telling Bush there were no candidates good enough to run as his V.P. - ignoring Powell, and then sliding into the position himself), Powell would be V.P. today, possibly President in 2008.  Similarly, if Bush #41 had not been so stubborn and instead replaced Quayle with Powell in '92, Powell might well have become first V.P., and then President
Never had I been so unhappy with my makeup as I was when I was using Clinique. I used Stay Beige (which I lightly patted on my face on top of Clinique's superfit liquid makeup - I have oily skin and was told this would help reduce the shine) and the end result was that it just made me look ghostly. I also hated how Clinique's liquid foundation and powder didn't have matching shades, so that I had to settle for Honey in the liquid and Beige in the powder. As much as I went back to Macy's to try to convince them that these weren't my shades, they just wouldn't listen. Either they didn't have the time or the patience to help me pick a new shade, or they were convinced I was making a big deal out of nothing. Instead of sitting there and arguing with them (which I shouldn't have to do in the first place) I just switched to a different makeup line: Laura Mercier, which I am VERY happy with. ---  --- I've had many other friends who were unhappy with Clinique and switched over to a different makeup brand, as well. I'm not trying to knock the product. I'm just saying it wasn't for me or for many of the other people I know. I would definitely NOT recommend Clinique to anyone. I'd rather pay a little more and get better results rather than settle for a $20 product just because it's affordable.
This is a great deal. This is a GREAT price... great glow... and quick delivery. I highly recommend this product
I was recently in the play Alladin, and whenever there was a break, the whole cast would gather to play "Encore."  We used songs from the musical we were in-and talk about a boatload of laughs! It's a blast!  Everyone loves it, because everyone gets involved, and has a great time.  This is a fabulous party game!  Buy it now
I watched this with some trepidation, and I have to say it was both better and worse than I thought it would be.  It was better because it remained fairly true to the original, in terms of retaining the multiple conflicting story lines and the ambiguous ending.  It was worse because the attempts at erotica were less entertaining than the original, and I found Stone's lampshade hairstyle oddly distracting. ---  --- A couple of things kept me viewing this DVD.  One was the London setting, which gave me an opportunity to see what time has done to one of my old home towns.  The other was Sharon Stone's rather plucky performance, and the presence of Charlotte Rampling, who has aged into a different kind of beauty.  Morrisey doesn't even come close to filling Michael Douglas's shoes, and it's hard to feel sorry for him at the end. ---  --- As with the first movie, you are left with the feeling that there was a better film waiting to be made.  The basic idea of a psychotic novelist who feels compelled to act out her fantasies in real life is an intriguing one.  However, both movies were quick to abandon Hitchcockian understatement for speeding cars and gratuitous sex.  There's nothing wrong with either of these things, but here they just get in the way
These speakers deliver a clear, crisp, and vibrant sound, with a richness expected of a higher-end speaker.  I would recommend these to anyone interested in a good-quality sound but keeping an eye on price
We must thank the director and salute Sigourney Weaver's beautiful performance: this movie gives us a rare insight into the lives and minds of the gentle, yet ferocious, giant mountains gorillas. It is also the amazing journey of an extroardinary woman who went to live by herself in a remote mountain of Rwanda, secluded from the world. She lost much of her sanity, as well as her life, in the process of saving the lives of a few hundred remaining gorillas. Without her work, who knows who could have saved them from savage murder and total extinction? Thanks to her work and dedication, a "lost cause" had been heard at last.  ---  --- The struggle for the survival of the "Great Apes" is not totally over though. One must hope that the abject poverty and the political unrest that still affect the region, as well as the illegal poaching and smuggling of goods and animals across borders - that happen with or without government officials' approval in each country involved - and the continuing deforestation and fauna's loss of habitat, can one day all come to an end so that the survival of these amazing creatures can be achieved.  ---  --- One must recognize the sacrifices and thank people like Diane Fossey, conservationists around the world, and the Rwandese people in particular, who have made it possible so far despite great internal economic and political pressures. All hope is not lost!
As ex-infantry I found this a big disappointment and almost unwatchable. This low budget movie spoils the book. A supposed highlight is the SAS field craft, but that's a bad joke. The SAS troop crowds around for camera shots, all the while talking loudly if not shouting. Bog normal infantry don't do this never mind the best of the best, the SAS. The fire-fight sequences are passable. The interrogation is the strongest part of the movie but can't make up for the rest of it. The foul language Even if it's what they used in the field, should have been ameliorated for the movie and it detracts a lot, making it unsuitable for many audiences
This lens has extremely fast (and quiet) focus, and is razor sharp.  What more could you want, when photographing wildlife up close
It has a clean soap smell! I also recommend the volume shampoo & conditioner it made my hair feel very soft
I bought this item based upon the reviews i read and i must say it lived up to the reviews.  It did the job. I bought this late in the summer but the one time i used it i was impressed by the amount of bugs that it zapped in a short space of time. I saw and felt the effectiveness of the product because i stayed in the backyard longer than usual
After having plastic tags crack and break off my suitcase, a leather bag tag is what i needed.  They stay on the suitcase and don't break
I enjoyed playing this game, when it would let me...the amount of bugs in this game is downright outrageous, crashes left and right.  It was a good story though.  I suppose I could give you a few tips... --- To stop the Dantooine framerate from dropping, go to the folder where your game files are ex. c:/program files/lucasarts/swkotor2, and open the swkotor2.ini file (on my xp the icon was a notepad with a cogwheel over it), and under the [Graphics Options] heading insert a line and type: --- Disable Vertex Buffer Objects=1 --- That should get rid of any bad framerate drops on Dantooine and at least make it playable. --- Also, I had a glitch near the end of the game where I went back to Dantooine, but when I tried to get off my ship, the planet wouldn't load, I tried restarting and all that jazz, nothing worked, finnaly I found online a cheatcode to warp straight to Dantooine so to use it, open the swkotor2.ini file as I said above and under the [Game Options] header insert a line and type: --- EnableCheats=1 --- Then Start StarWars:KOTOR2 and load your game, and press this button: --- `  --- the one with the ~ sign right above it, just above the tab key. --- Then type: --- warp 605dan --- -Then Press Enter- --- Don't worry about the fact you can't see your typing, the cheat console is invisible. And Tada! Your on Dantooine and Can finish your game! --- The only other advice I have for you is !Save Often! and !Don't OverWrite Your Saved Games! I found that saving your games as 1,2,3,4,etc., to be a quick way to do this. ---  --- May the Force be with You
The backpack is great.  It is a wonderful tool for dogs with lots of energy.  You can fill it with lots of weight and they love carrying it.  It secures well, and dogs love it.  If you give a dog a job, they really feel useful, and I think they appreciate it a lot
I bought this along with the "Some Kind of Gorgeous" foundation faker.  I don't have the best skin, (oily), but like a more natural look.  These two product together are so great.  I look natural, but healthier.  And my skin stays less shiny all day.  I use the other side of the foundation sponge to apply it
this is a classic gangster movie already, anyone whos into the whole block scene should add this to their collection
Well, almost. The seats were good and I drank straight out of the bottle. The DVD wasn't what I thought I had purchased but I'm not at all unhappy about getting it. Very, very, very good quality audio/video and I don't mind watching it often
I found this product did absolutely NOTHING for me...granted I don't have huge wrinkles, but the few I do have certainly got no better and i'm wondering if it made them worse! I wish I had asked around from friends, cause if I had I would have discovered this on my own without wasting the money. I'm wondering a couple of things, what all the fuss is about with strivectin? Is it just that everyone is different and some people have good results and some don't? AND is there anyone out there who can recommend a product that REALLY works? (if it works i don't mind spending the money...
I was thrilled to find this set here on Amazon, and buying this set is so much cheaper then buying each volume seperatly. All of the DVD's have some good interviews with the producers, designers, voice actors, and other people associated with the show.  I don't usually like watching interviews/things where people talk a lot, but I love watching those interviews over and over and seeing the steps they took to make this show as good as it was. I totall reccomend it to anyone looking for something a little different
i love nature and cowboy movies.  Jeremiah Johnson was on of the best movies i've seen.  it is unforgetable.  It was my favorite  RobertRedford movie.  He did very little talking talking in this movie, he just acted, his best performance ever.  the movie deals with the american indian also, in a profound and touching way.  this movie is engrossing and based on a true story,  it's simply the best. Don't miss the opportunity to see this movie, it is a classic.  It truly is in a league of it's own.  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  --- 
I couldn't even assemble the product, and there were no instructions on how to do so
The pieces of this toy (the outfits, etc.) all ripped when we pulled them off the starter sheet.  Also, the pieces are too little and get easily lost when played with and the outfits are uncolorful and depressing. In general, this toy is hokey and cheap.  I recommend Melissa and Doug's Magnetic Dress-Up and/or --- Magnetic Princess Dress-Up. All the pieces are wooden and are large enough to keep together.  Also, the outfits are colorful and beautiful and they come in nice wooden boxes with lids so that a child can keep things organized. 
I ordered the camera case for the Canon Digital Elph 450. And I was given a completely different one. Prices sound great, but they do not deliver what you buy. Had a bad experience with them.
The show is absolutely GREAT! Blue Falcon is another Space Ghost and Dynomut is the futuristic version of Scooby Doo. Dim witted and loveable. Getting the complete show is great and the shows from these HB vaults are all looking pretty good with bright and vivid colors (amid some nasty scratches and dust, but it WAS cheap animation folks). As a Scooby fan this is a MUST own! I quite enjoy the Blue Falcon/Dynomut show also.  ---  --- 5 stars for the show. ---  --- The set however nice still drops the ball, you get two single sided dvds and two flippers. The problem with this is that the dvds are all on top of each other with maybe a 1/16th of an inch between them both. I know this was to cut down on costs but it makes the two flipper discs quite hard to get out without scratching them or marking them up with a good fingerprint smear. But then again if it was a perfect world we couldn't complain. ---  --- All in all a solid set! ---  --- 4 1/2 out of 5
Even if this magazine is a mag-a-log, what would we do without it? September issue rocks with Eva Mendes on the cover and some juicy fall finds inside. The biggest news? Lucky has found a way to shop with your cell while stuck in traffic. It's about time technology got up with our lifestyle
This album is very weak compared to his earlier efforts.  The music is simple and straightforward, and the rapping is poor
The professionals in the law field in this book aren't the type of lawyer or law professional most people want to become.  I understand not everyone becomes a six-figure-paid lawyer right out of law school, but this book is ridiculous.  It shadows a guy who wants to only be a law clerk?  Give me a break
Don't buy Zone Alarm if you use AOL; they are not compatable.  The pop-ups will drive you crazy and AOL won't work properly.  Also plan on your computer running much slower when this software is installed.  I bought it from Amazon and had to throw it away in a month...  no refund; money lost.  Norton is far better with AOL
it's a nice pool..a pain in the ass to blow up without a pump but oh well. lol  it's a good tuy over all to have and holds a lot  of water. it's just hard to dump it all out once you're finished..that drain hole should be on the side and NOT on the bottom of the pool
Quickly became my favorite when it first came out.  Tastes great and the milk doesn't turn orange like some of the new granola type cereals.  I also use it on ice cream to add crunch.  I would give it 5 stars but even though it think it's great it is overpriced.  Price here is about the same as out local Safeway
There's nothing "universal" about this product.  It'll split lightweight stuff like cell phones, but don't trust anything more demanding than that with this splitter.  I hooked my laptop up through it and the fuse blew within one second.  Sadly, I'd bought four of these since shipping cost as much as the item itself, and ALL FOUR died when I tried them with my laptop.  The back of the package says not to use items that use over a total of 10amps, which seemed reasonable, so I got out my ammeter and figured out that my laptop used 6amps at most, so not only is this busted, but they lie on the package.  I managed to open up the splitter and put in some more heavy duty wiring and a stronger fuse, and then it worked for a short time until I started smelling plastic melting -- it turns out even one of the springs inside couldn't handle 6amps and heated up enough to disfigure and melt plastic around it.  I give this item two stars only because you might want to plug in two cell phones simultaneously.  For anything else, beware
I've bought a LOT from Amazon over the years. This was the first watch though. I've bought and owned several SEIKO watches. This is probably the WORST experience that I've ever had with Amazon and Seiko too! ---  --- The watch came with a box that looked water damaged. The watch itself has a broken clasp. It looks beautiful,but I bought it as a gift.  ---  --- When she opened it, the clasp refused to lock. Its never gone far enough to have the time set or even being tried on. Amazon actually tried to sleeze out of it by telling me to follow the waranty pocedures. How long does she have to wait for her Birthday gift? The warranty process could take weeks
I ended up getting a total of 6 of these units for all the trucks at my work. Overall they work fairly well. No problems jumping our work trucks. Chevy 1500 work trucks and a couple ford F150's. The light comes in handy. The air compressor does take a while to fill up a tire, and the hose is kinda short,but it does work. Other than that, it works great and has a built in battery tester which is nice to see. I have no problem getting multiple jumps in between charges. It recommends charging them once a month even if you don't use them. 4/5 Star
The synopsis ... --- Sam and Jonah Baldwin, father and son, have lost the most important woman in their lives to cancer.  Seeking to escape from the painful memories that lurk in every nook and cranny of Chicago, they move to Seattle.  Eighteen months later, Jonah can sense that his dad is still sad; and, in desperation calls a nationally syndicated radio self-help guru on Christmas Eve to wish for his father a new wife.  Annie Reed lives in Baltimore and is engaged to Walter.  Their relationship, while loving and comfortable, is entirely devoid of romantic sparks.  When Annie hears Jonah's soulful plea on the radio, it's as if her heart has been touched by "magic" and she is determined to find out why she feels so powerfully drawn to Sam and his son ... even if it means traveling across "like 26 states". ---  --- The critique ... --- Sleepless in Seattle is a brilliantly simple film; that's what makes it so great.  To quote Nora Ephron, "It isn't a movie about love, it's a movie about love in the movies."  To emphasize this point, she incorporates various parallel references to "An Affair to Remember" throughout the film; but, Sleepless is also a movie about our genuine romantic fantasies and sentimental ideals about falling in love (which, let's admit it, have been undeniably shaped by what we've seen on the silver screen).  The script is refreshingly candid, yet endearing and Nora Ephron's direction is impeccable.  Ross Malinger, cast as Jonah Baldwin, is the youngest and most notable talent in the film.  He does an excellent job of portraying THE quintessential eight-year-old; he's impulsive, moody and thinks he knows it all.  (I speak from experience here folks; I currently have a son that age.)  He and Tom Hanks come together flawlessly as father and son; so successfully in fact, that they would be utterly convincing off screen.  The chemistry between Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks is equally amazing, which is no small achievement considering the fact that they rarely appear together in a scene.  The supporting cast is brimming with talent and includes Rosie O'Donnell, Bill Pullman, Rita Wilson, Rob Reiner, David Hyde Pierce, and a young Gaby Hoffmann.  Families with younger children will appreciate the film's integrity; there is very little foul language ("God damn it" and " ... it scared the shit out of me ..." being the worst of it) and no "sexual content" to be wary of.  All around, this is a winning film.  One that I find myself watching over and over and over again. ---  --- The DVD ... --- For a 10th Anniversary Edition, the special features are few and rather disappointing.  You've got your basic director commentary, a music video ("When I Fall in Love" by Celine Dion & Clive Griffin), and a "Love in the Movies" Featurette.  This last piece is approximately 15 minutes long.  It features the director, producers, actors and the hosts of Loveline: Drew Pinsky and Adam Carolla (why they are included, I don't know) talking about "Love in the Movies."  There are some interesting interview segments with an Empire State Building Historian and some very beautiful shots of the New York skyline before 9/11; but there's certainly nothing here to write home about.  By far, the most exciting feature is that you can choose your aspect ratio.  (And honestly, how exciting is that?)  This a DVD that you buy for the film alone.

These placemats are perfect for a toddler who loves to dump food out and spread it out on the table, especially for when you're out in public places.  They stick onto anything and have fun things for kids to look at (my son is obsessed with anything Sesame Street - esp Elmo - so he loves staring at the placemat).  They're easy to fit into any purse, diaper bag, pocket so they're always accessible. 
This product costs 10 times more then a regular gel.  But it does not even work as well as a regular shaving gel.  Its like putting a thin layer of soap on you face.  It did not help at all. No doubt the people who marked this up one thousand present are the geniuses in the Marketing Department, because, it fooled me just like it fooled everyone; $$$18 FOR A GEL! IT MUST BE more effective, "I'll give it a try". There is a sucker born every day. ---  --- Jose' (sucker
I had two choices watching this movie...smile or laugh out loud. When I wasn't smiling I was laughing. Keaton's The General is a perfect introduction for those who may shy away from silent movies or who may think silent comics are too exaggerated and mannered. The story line is simple, but what Keaton does with it is genius.  ---  --- Johnny Gray (Buster Keaton) is an engineer for the Western and Atlantic Railroad. He has two loves, his engine, the General, and Annabelle Lee (Marion Mack), a fine Southern belle. When war starts, Johnny rushes to enlist but is rejected. He's more valuable to the South as a train engineer than he would be as a soldier. Trouble is, nobody tells him why he was rejected. Worse, Annabelle thinks he may be a coward, and tells him she doesn't want to see him again until he is in uniform. Just then northern spies secretly enter the town to steal the General and take it north, destroying bridges and lines along the way, while a Northern army moves south. Unknowingly, Annabelle Lee finds herself on the train and is kidnapped. Johnny sees the General chugging away and races after it, determined to bring back the General. When he realizes Annabelle Lee is held captive, his resolve knows to bounds. ---  --- For the rest of the movie we are on one of the cleverest, fastest, funniest chase movies ever filmed. Keaton creates slapstick situations and sight gags that not only are funny, but that always are in character and which always are part of the specific plot point. And when he rescues Annabelle and realizes how hopeless her Southern belle helplessness can be, his exasperation is matched only by his love. The General features a big cast, a major battle, fleeing armies, a failing dam and a spectacular moment when an engine tries to cross a burning bridge and everything collapses into a river gorge. ---  --- Keaton's timing and inventiveness are legendary; so is his risk-taking. He does all his own stunts and some of them were dangerous. In one, he is lying back on the engine's cow catcher while the train is moving at some speed forward. In the distance is a railroad tie across the tracks. Keaton has another railroad tie in his hands. At the last moment he tosses his tie so that the end hits the end of the other tie and they both bounce off the track just as Keaton on the cow catcher passes. This scene has no cutting. The two ties fly off as high as Keaton's head. He could have been killed; instead we laugh. It's amazing that in his older years Keaton could still walk. His body took incredible punishment for the laughs. Try falling hard backwards off a moving flatcar and landing on your back across railroad ties. His ingenuity is extraordinary. How do you build excitement out of an extended train chase? Both engines are behemoths and are on the same track. They can't pass each other. Keaton does it with endless bits of business. In fact, he does manage to reverse the chase at one point in an immensely clever moment combining logic and split-second timing. ---  --- What makes Keaton so funny and so contemporary is that he doesn't do double-takes. He barely reacts. But he's no stone-face. Keaton's characters are simply very serious fellows. Things happen to them. His characters don't react to events so much as they overcome them with honesty and good intentions. ---  --- This edition of The General comes from Kino Video and looks good. It includes two Keaton short films, The Playhouse (1921) and Cops (1922). In The Playhouse, Keaton portrays all the members of the cast, orchestra and audience in a stage show, including nine members of a minstrel act, the ladies in the audience and a trained chimp. In Cops, he finds himself in a police chase that is one amazing situation after another
I love the look and they are very comfortable on my feet. I got the black and white, and I love them with a pair of capris or long shorts
I picked up a bag of these at my local health food store a few months ago after hearing that Pirate's Booty was a great product. These tasted rather odd to me and I wound up getting rid of the bag as quickly as possible. Puffed corn and a chocolate type of taste just don't go well together in my opinion. It might have been ok if the cocoa was all you could taste, but that was not the case here
I had this this a couple years ago and it kept jamming on me
I WAS VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT!  I WAS GIVEN THE SHAMPOO FOR CHRISTMAS WHICH WHEN WASHING MY HAIR MADE LITTLE TO NO SUDS.  WHEN TRYING TO COMB OUT MY HAIR AFTER SHAMPOOING IT WAS LIKE A BEES NEST AND I COULDN'T POSSIBLY GET A COMB THRU IT.  THATS WHEN I ORDERED THE CONDITIONER WHICH WAS LIKE CAKE BATTER AND COULDN'T GET IT TO COME OUT OF THE CONTAINER WITH REALLY QUEEZING IT WHICH MADE THE LETTERING COME OFF ON TO YOUR HANDS AND I FOUND SOME IN MY HAIR. I SQUEEZE AND BANG UNTIL I FINALLY GET A BIG LUMP COMING OUT.  I HAD WATCHED ALL OF JONATHAN'S REALITY SHOWS WHEN HE WAS WORKING ON CREATING HIS PRODUCTS AND COULDN'T WAIT TO TRY THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL NATURAL. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED!  I RECENTLY SAW HIS SHOW BACK TV WHERE SOMEONE CALLS HIM UP AND SAYS THEY TRIED HIS PRODUCT AND HOW HAPPY THEY WERE AND JONATHAN GETS ALL CHOCKED UP.  I WAS SCREAMING AT THE TV I WAS SO UPSET.  THE PRODUCT WAS NOT CHEAP AND CAN'T BELIEVE I CAN'T USE SOMETHING I SPENT SO MUCH MONEY ON.

I loved the first Carole Matthews novel I read, "For Better or Worse", and picked this up in an airport hoping to be entertained once again. It kept me entertained while on a three and a half hour flight, but only because I didnt' have anything else to do. I am the type of person who has to finish a book once they start but it was really hard for me to even pick this one up again after getting off the plane.   ---  --- I totally disagree with the premise behind the whole thing and found it completely pointless. There were no redeeming qualities and few parts in the book even worth mentioning. To me, Matthews expects you to feel sorry for a woman whose married lover decided he needed to be with his wife and kids instead of leaving them for her. I think this is a horrible/unrealistic messgage.  ---  --- If you want to read something good, pick up a Jane Green novel instead. 
The filter is small compared with most other systems; has a sturdy, metal fixture and pull-knob activator; filters quickly with plenty pressure; and of course it has the great Culligan taste
This cd is so awesome, It stays in my cd player and I have recently added it to my MP3.
I love this shoe! It looks very elegant on the foot and there's a little bit toe cleavage which is always a plus! But make sure to go half a size up. It's a little snug in the front and it takes a couple wears to break it in.
I did a lot of research and if you follow directions , it is safe and fun. --- It takes about 25 min to heat the oil and 45 minutes to cook an 11 lb. turkey. The pot has a maximum oil level mark and that was the correct amount for our bird. The turkey must be dried well to prevent spattering. Watch the oil temp. so it does not go over 350. Do it outdoors as the paint has to burn off the burners and it smells.
There's really nothing more that can be said to further the reputation of this series of grills.  Those of us that own the Genesis E-310 series grill know how well this grill is manufactured, and just how very well it performs its duties.  It is, by far, the very best gas grill in this price range I have ever owned or used.  A couple of notes: --- -The cross-over ignition system works wonderfully (it takes less than 3 seconds to fire up all three burners --- -Those who say that their gas grill does not get hot enough to sear meats don't own this grill- I've had it up to 550 degrees on a very cold MN winter day --- -That said, it seems to go through a good amount of propane when running all 3 burners on high...but that is probably obvious considering the temps you can obtain when running it on full.  (It will be interesting to see if I can get 500 + degrees to sear meats on medium setting on a summer day....).  The fuel gauge inside the cabinet is also a handy feature --- -As always with this series of grills- No Flare ups, and the flavorizer bars do what Weber says they will, namely vaporize fats and juices into smoke that adds flavor to what you are grilling --- -To keep this review balanced, there is one negative- I dislike the tool holders.  Although there are plenty, your tools pretty much have to have one of those leather hanging loop things to keep the tools from falling off or even to use the holders (a small price to pay I guess) ---  --- Finally, the Genesis E-310 I purchased came in a copper color, something I haven't seen on Amazon, or on Weber's site for that matter.  Maybe I missed it, or maybe I got lucky.  Either way, it looks pretty darn sharp on our deck when it isn't covered
Love this product.  I like having these Microsoft programs without paying the price for the full versios
It's flimsy...breaks at the slightest touch...it's a PAIN to open and close!  My 15 month old figured out that all you have to do is shake the gate a little and it opens...I found this out when I was putting groceries away...I went to look for her and she was on the 2nd stair from the top!  I can't say enough bad things about this gate.  It's worthless.  If I could rate it MINUS stars I would
I purchased this Boombox over a year and a half ago.  What I do like about is that it was hard to find a boombox with a remote and Mp3 playback.  I agree that it could have been better.  It would be nice to be able to rewind from the first to the last.  You cannot rewind/fast forward in the song in Mp3 format but you can do it with a regular audio cd. sometimes I like to hear a certain portion of a song again, but I will have to play the entire song again. I no longer have the remote and there are some things that I cannot do anymore. 
A great great novel! Catches you from the beginning and doesn't let go. You become obsessed and engrossed. Collins has the most gorgeous way of writing....drawing you in. And his descriptive ability is astounding
I bought this headset for internet chats with my husband, when he travels for business. I find it comfortable to wear and easy to use.  The sound quality is good, volume more than adequate and my husband does not hear any echo. ---  --- I like the fact that it uses an AAA battery instead of a charger. All you need is a spare battery and no worries about the device dying when the internal battery dies. (Even rechargeables do not last forever.)  ---  --- The ear wrap is comfortable and stays securely on my ear. It would be nice if it bent for a custom fit, but I am pretty happy with it
don't buy this item...I was cheated...now i am gonna send it back. --- Its really waste of your money. --- don't go by the price...i will never buy anything from this site
I was really looking forward to reading "Ever After" when I saw the favorable quote on the back cover by  Larry Gelbart. But the book turned out to be a VERY cursory glance at the past 25 years of musical theater with remarkably little insight. Here are the three things I learned from this book: (1) Mega-musicals are almost always artistically corrupt; (2) Andrew Lloyd Webber is the anti-Christ; (3) The only innovative musicals to arrive in the past 25 years started Off-Broadway (mostly at Playwrights Horizons and Lincoln Center). Most of the hundreds of shows mentioned in this book get one paragraph each, with very few illuminating details. Here's what the author says about "Carrie," perhaps the most famous recent Broadway musical flop: "Carrie, of course, was an instant classic, a monument in the pantheon of failed Broadway musicals. Adapated by Michael Gore (music) and Don Pitchford (lyrics) from the notorious Stephen King novel (and even more notorious film), this $7 million musical celebration of prom vengeance and bad taste materialized at the Virginia Theater on the 12th of May, 1988 and was gone by the 15th, touching all who saw it with a timeless reverence for its indelible, monumental ineptitude." Does that really tell us very much about this musical? Did Barry Singer even see the show? You sure wouldn't know it from this description. And just what, I wonder, makes King's novel "notorious" or the movie "even more notorious"? Almost every show in this book rates that brief a mention, but somehow Singer finds time for an entire chapter of Lloyd Webber-bashing where Sir Andrew invites the author to a cocktail party to show off his newest female singing discovery. The chapter sticks out like a sore thumb, if only because it has nothing to do with the rest of the book, but also because it's one of the few times that Singer goes into any detail. Aside from a few interesting Sondheim quotes, this book is a waste of time.
This series has just a tad too much blood for my taste... it verges on horror, here and there, which bugs me; I even like super-violent action movies just fine, but the brutally slaughtered recent corpse thing (more 'personalized' violence than killing bad guys) is not my style. This is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. ---  --- Aside from that detail, I find this show totally addictive. The brothers make a 'buddy movie' effect, and the whole supernatural framework creates a sort of non-religious yet definitely spiritual effect (the big mystery being why these guys never ever are seen praying in the show; I have actually known people who had a lifestyle similar to what the show depicts, and that is central). ---  --- Not to mention the young men being so passionate, powerful, strong, yet sensitive, darkly troubled from the past, sheer SEXY it's nearly intoxicating over the long run of many episodes. ;-) ---  --- Anyway -- the show has an actual plot, it's well filmed and intelligently done and is well worth watching. I recommend it
Registry mechanic is a great registry tool.  It works better than the registry tools included with Symantec System Works.  If you purchase this version at 5.1 you can get a free upgrade to the latest version 6.0 once you register the product.  Try the evaluation and you will see how many registry errors your machine may have that can effect its performance
Right, just so everyone knows, I have never played this game, however, i think you should read this. --- I bought Fable, and found that my computers graphics card was not compatible with it. It is good enough but not supported, so to avoid this i suggest checking the support section of the website before you buy to check that your card is compatible. --- As they have actually put a list of cards on the site, i assume that this problem is not uncommon so i advise you to check this before buying the game. Just thought you should know
It is a nice watch for the Dollar spent on this item. The catch is that it will work with the concept of Wave-ceptor. And it adjusts time according to the place you are in. So...good watch..!
I enjoyed this game quite a bit--I ended up putting all of the other games I was playing aside to just finish this one.  You play as the three Baudelaire kids.  The story follows the 2004 Lemony Snicket film fairly closely, as you must first escape Count Olaf's decrepit mansion, then avoid being killed by a train before you head off to Uncle Monty's herpetology paradise, Aunt Josephine's seaside town, and finally save Violet Baudelaire from a fate worse than death.  The environments are attractive and fun to explore, and the game play and puzzles are neither too easy nor too challenging and frustrating. ---  --- For most of the game--as you explore environments, solve puzzles, search for secret rooms and such, you can switch between Violet and Klaus Baudelaire as you please.  For many "important" events, such as boss fights, you must play as one or the other, as they each have different skills and weapons.  For some sequences--those that are basically 2D platformer sections (the entire game has some platformer aspects, but it's usually loosely employed and 3D), you must play as Sunny, the baby Baudelaire (and this is the only time you can play as her). ---  --- The various puzzles and challenges--they almost amount to a series of "mini-games", are varied and mostly non-repetitive, helping retain your interest.  Some are fairly easy to figure out and perform, but some are appropriately more challenging, both mentally and in terms of manipulating the controller, and take many tries to complete.  A couple first-person shooter sequences (the game is mostly in a third person mode), are especially challenging, particularly the end, but that's the final boss fight, so that's to be expected.  Like most games, winning boss fights requires discerning patterns in the bosses and adapting a strategy appropriate to the pattern, which takes both brains and manual dexterity. ---  --- There are a couple negatives with the game, but they are minor.  Games like this, released in response to the success of a film, are often rushed through production.  That becomes evident here in the cut scenes, which are not very exciting--they feature 2D black and white sketches that are more like a slide show as major portions of the story are read to us.  But I'd rather have skimping done in cut scenes than in game play, and that's just what was done here.  Also, although the graphics are wonderful for the most part, the visuals are a bit dark overall--I found it best to play with the lights off.  With a bright overhead light on, the glare was too much to see important information in the game.  Finally, I would have preferred a different save game scheme, as you can only save when the game asks if you want to, and the save points seem almost random.  Sometimes you can save after accomplishing only one more minor task.  Sometimes you have to do long sequences (and sometimes a number of challenging ones) before you can save again. ---  --- The game isn't quite as funny as the film and doesn't have exactly the same "magical" atmosphere, but it is an engaging and fun journey to another world.  The soundtrack, by Jeremy and Julian Soule, and inspired by Thomas Newman's great soundtrack for the film, is also a major asset--I found myself wanting to explore levels again later on as much to hear the music again as anything else
...and I've tried quite a few.  I tried over 30 varieties of green tea bags searching for a good cup, and this one takes the crumpet!  The flavor is strong but mild, the color golden brown, and the aroma is light.  I threw out all the others (or rather I gave them to my father-in-law who also like tea) when I found this one and I bought a case of it..
Good black tea is not hard to find - just hard to find in your grocery store.   ---  --- The honest truth is that Tazo really does not make many, if any really good teas.  This, in particular, is one of their worst.  It is bitter and leaves a bad taste in your mouth immediately. ---  --- Every time i get stuck in a starbucks with friends i am faced with the choice - tea, chai or steamed milk.  Every time i cave in and give Tazo another chance it disappoints me.  If you want a good black tea look for a local tea shop and let them brew you a few cups.  Try a keemun, a lapsang and maybe golden dianhong and see how it goes.  If you really want to kick it up a notch look for a  --- Cameroonian black. ---  --- take it from someone who really loves tea, this stuff is not worth your time.  and when you get good tea, please don't brew it in your coffee maker
The shoes look and wear great.  However, the leather is pretty weak.  I think I must have kicked a table leg or something on my frist outing in them.  Now the tip of my left shoe has a quarter-size scuff on it.  I will have to try to cover it up by oiling it.  Obviously I don't think this pair will last long at all
I bought a 700 series iRiver to use at the gym, which came with this Armband, at first it was great, but it didn't last, there are two clasps which don't sta attcked well, and the pocket that holds the mp3 player itself is held together with a glue that comes undone after a few weeks of daily use
This book is poorly written and even more poorly edited. The back cover states ... "every subject is given background and basic exercises to allow beginners to figure it out." It is a great statement, but it is unfortunately not true. ---  --- Page 6: "So what formats can a script be saved as? There are three main kinds of script files: regular compiled script, which is the native AppleScript file format, and scripts saved as plain text or as applications. On top of that, OS X added a new option for saving compiled scripts and script applications called "bundle." Bundles are folders that appear and behave as files. You can read about them in Chapter 23." - I guess bundle is not a "main" format? Why is there a distinction between main formats and, for lack of a better term, minor formats? I have no idea.  ---  --- Page 35: "Every class has a super class." --- Page 40: "We saw that objects belong to classes, and classes may have subclasses and super classes." - Which sentence is correct? ---  --- Page 43: "When you work with an application that doesn't support the whose clause, you have to settle for slower, clumsier repeat loops." - Repeat loops are not explained earlier in the book. There is no reference on this page to the repeat loops that are explained extensively in Chapter 11, pages 321-343. ---  --- I wanted to like this book, but I do not. I look forward to a revised first edition or new second edition of this book, because it does have potential to be great. However the next edition needs more polished writing and meticulous editing
This is a great battery charger that you need if you have a boat and trolling motor.  High quality and easy to use
I just made this soup for the first time, and it could not have been easier.  Add water, heat, and then garnish with a little cheese.   ---  --- I didn't find it terribly spicy hot. The chiles used are nice and mild. ---  --- A tasty dinner indeed
I read the other reviews, some glowing, others well.. not so glowing.  The price was right, ($149 - 50 rebate) So I thought I would take a chance.  I read the other reviews so I have no one else to blame but myself. ---  ---   First off, I am only interested in playing videos from my computer, so I have no idea how well the image viewing or MP3 playing works.   ---  ---   I also notice other people reviewing this product had all kinds of problems with wireless connections.  My house is fully wired with CAT5, therefore I am using this product wired, not wireless. ---  ---   I was able to get the device connected to my network and reading files from the media server within 10 minutes of opening the carton... so far so good.   The first thing I did was check for updates.  An update was found and updated successfully. ---  ---   I then had the DSM-320 look for media servers.  It found the tversity server right away and I was able to see the contents listed.  This unfortunately is the end of the good news.  It's all went downhill from here. ---  ---   1.  Neither server, tversity or the Dlink were smart enough to view a folder of VOB files as a movie.  They listed them as VOB_1, VOB2 etc.  So for example, I clicked on my Casablanca folder, I would then need to click on VOB_1 to start the movie.  When VOB_1 ended after about 20 minutes, it did not go to VOB_2.   I needed to use the remote and manually select the next item to play.   arrrgghh!!  P.O.S. thing. ---  ---   2.  As another review stated, the FF simply does not work properly.  Oh, sure if you press FF the movie will fast forward.  But there is no way to stop it.  If you press play while the movie is FF'wding, the movie starts to play from the beginning of the current VOB.  more, arrrrgghh! --- This alone is enough of a nuisance to return the device.  Which I will be doing first thing in the morning. ---  --- My final advice to any prospective buyers:  S T A Y   A W A Y !!!! ---  --- My final advic to D-Link, Great idea, but your product absolutely sucks. ---  --- Oh one more thing,  Someone mentioned that their tech support was very freindly.  Yes the two ladies I spoke to were both very friendly, their English was terrible.  (Guess which county you call for tech support... oh come on, just one guess)  It also sounded like each of the tech support personnel are sitting shoulder to shoulder to one another.  I could hear at least 2 other tech support people communicating with their clients.  Which made it very difficult for the lady helping me.  She needed to ask me to repeat myself over and over.  Sheesh,  I must have read my phone number to her at least 4 times before she got it right. ---  --- One last interesting tidbit, on the packaging, they mention Nero recode CE.  So I went to the nero site to check it out.  Nero has a list of Supported Media Players listed.  And you know what, D-Link is NOT one of them.  I will return this D-Link junk and purchase one the Nero certified product instead. ---  --- I bow my head in shame, As I had read the reviews but I bought the product anyway.
This is a good medium priced shaver.  It does a good job, is fast, and easy to clean.  It is attractive, and fits the hand well. Not top of the line, but a good value.  Nothing negative to report.
... which makes the wrench completely useless.  I'll have to buy another wrench elsewhere from a vendor that supplies the bits.  Also, the wooden handles have splinters and are extremely cheaply made.  Do not buy this product
This is very soothing for people with arthritis or any kind of injury and makes your hand feel wonderful
Like any parent, I was concerned about SIDS so the SleepSack seemed like the perfect alternative to blankets.  Little did I know, I would come to LOVE the SleepSack for it's warming capabilities. After a few months under their belt, babies get VERY squirmy in the middle of the night, so blankets are useless (and dangerous).  So I relied heavily on the SleepSacks to keep my little guy warm, even after the risk of SIDS passed. They come in fleece for winter months and cotton for warmer months, and they're generous in size, so they are not outgrown easily. I only wish I'd purchased them in yellow or white, in case my next baby is the opposite sex
I lost my HP R607 while on vacation and needed to replace it quickly. I couldn't fine another R607 (which I really liked), so I purchased the HP M407. I thought it would be the next best thing to my misplaced camera...NOT!! I don't like anything about this camera...It's terrible!  You can take about 4 pictures with regular batteries, about 10 with rechargeable ones (even with screen off). It says "auto focus", but I don't think it has any focus at all....not far away, not close up, nothing! It takes a really looooooooong time to actually Take the picture after you press the button.  I really hate it!  Keep Looking...Don't buy this camera
This movie is not worth Sam Elliot.  I was very dissapointed, I will most likely thow it away
This is a preety good game but after a while, it is very boring. i enjoyed it for about 2 months but now i am not intrested in it
I HAVE BOUGHT SEVERAL OF THEIR BRACELETS,BUT THIS ONE HAS A SPECIAL QUALITY TO IT,IT LOOKS SO EXPENSIVE,AND IS SO PRETTY,MATCHES EVERYTHING,WHAT CAN I SAY,I GUESSS THE LORD WAS GOOD TO ME,FINDING THIS AT A PRICE I CAN AFFORD,THE FIRST TIME I WORE IT,I GOT A COMPLIMENT,EVERYONE WANTS TO KNOW WHERE I GOT IT,I LOVE THIS BRACELET
My husband is using the Rosetta Stone Spanish program and loves it
I love me some Mamet.  His dialogue takes some getting used to, since it is crafted so as to touch on the edges of realism while inhabiting a more stylistic realm.  I also love his dedication to his actors, employing the same ones over and over, so that his movies come off as different shows performed by the same theatrical troupe, which may very well be his point. ---  --- However, Edmond is the first Mamet film to leave me disappointed and, worse, annoyed. ---  --- Macy plays Edmond with typical wide-eyed aplomb.  Edmond is a man who is weak, but is valiantly (if not clumsily) trying to be strong.  The movie starts with a chance encounter with a fortune teller whose tarot card reading provides a cinematic outline for the remainder of the film.  Edmond then goes home, breaks up with his wife, and goes on a deaf, dumb, and blind search for himself, finding instead over-priced whores, pimps who are not-what-they-seem, and -- generally -- everything but himself. ---  --- I get the point: Edmond is the epitome of modern man's emasculation, unable to find his own balls with both hands, and his tawdry and panicked search through New York for some unnameable salvation is an example of the lengths anyone must go (man or woman) to find, if not redemption, then the places where one "belongs." ---  --- There are a lot of problems here.  Most superficially, there's one of packaging.  The DVD box prominently features a picture of a gun, and no gun appears in the film.  The tags on the box call the film, alternately, a mystery and a fast-paced thriller, when it is neither one of those things.  Not even close.  This movie is (like most of Mamet's work) based on a play; never before has it been more obvious (unless you count the absolutely brilliant Oleanna).   ---  --- Edmond is, essentially, a one-man show, with Macy delivering numbing and rambling monologues, stopped only occasionally to engage in awkward and almost meaningless side action with ancillary characters (some of them played well -- Denise Richards actually shines in her brief scene as a hooker -- and some of them not so well -- Julia Stiles seems over-medicated in her role as an ambivalent and easily persuaded waitress).  In spite of how they do and don't help Edmond make his way through the tunnel of decadence and misery he creates for himself, most of these characters seem disposable, making the movie come across as equally dismissable.  (I would also like to take a moment here to make a small observation about Rebecca Pidgeon, Mamet's wife, an actress who appears, I think, in every single one of her husband's films: this woman is, viewed in even the nicest of lights, one of the worst actresses I've ever seen, and she sucks the life out of every scene she's in.  In this movie she plays Edmond's wife, and does so with heartless and uninspired vehemence.  It's nice that Mamet gives his wife the opportunities he does, but one has to wonder if she'd ever get any acting work at all if she weren't married to such a famous writer/director). ---  --- At the risk of spoiling the film, I will say that, at the end, Edmond finally does find where he "belongs," a place that, given his previous struggles, makes a lot of sense (although the manner in which he finds this belonging might offend more than a few viewers).  But this is small consolation since, by this time, few people are likely to have any sympathy for Edmond or where he ends up.  His character's slap-dash personality combined with the persistent and mostly meaningless monologues on fate, fear, destiny and (ironically) meaning make for a benumbing and distasteful cinematic experience.  A few good performances and some nice, visceral cinematography do not save this film from its plot and the dialogue that fails to move that plot along.  Avoid this flick; try Oleanna or Glen Gary Glenross instead. ---  --- 
I purchased this rail today for my daughter's crib that "converts" into a toddler bed.  Everything on the outside of the box looked great, until we got home, put it together and put it on the crib.  There is only about 6 inches of space for my daughter to climb in and out of bed.  Also it sits in about 3 inches which significantly reduces the amount of sleep space.  After playing with it for awhile, I decided to look over the instructions again.  It states in the warning section that this rail is only for a bed with a box spring and mattress and is not intended for a crib or toddler bed.  My question is "WHY DIDN'T IT SAY THIS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BOX?!" 
Apart from the emotional content due to the fact that a grandson defends his grandfather who is going to be executed for a racist crime, the films deals with the death penalty with great sympathy and ethical enlightenment. It also reveals with some silent moments here and there that the decision to execute the murderer is not at all taken for real moral reasons but only for political reasons. The governor finally gives the go-ahead message and refuses to pardon the murderer or even to stay the execution for some new investigation in some facts that appeared at the very last minute, and this under pressure from a crowd and he even announces his decision in front of this crowd and TV cameras. This is what is particular unbeareable about the death penalty : the final decision is always taken by some elected politician who turns it into his own political campaign  Just for that reason it is unethical. The film also reveals how the grandfather is transformed in just 28 days by the energy and dedication  of his grandson. He finally realizes, as he says so well, that he was not completely black and evil and that there must have been something good in him that he transmitted to his son who transmitted it in his turn to his grandson. There was a new hope in that man. But that was too late and that could not be taken into account by the governor. ---  --- Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Universit Paris Dauphine, Universit Paris I Panthon Sorbonne
OK, I'm a SciFi fan.  I read the SciFi reviews and thought this was really a movie for me, and it really was good right up to the end.  Just one problem, they forgot to write the end.  What happened?  Did they run out of money?  Did the writer write himself into a corner?  There was no climax, conclusion, or resolution.  You can argue till you are blue in the face about "pan & scan."  I prefer movies with an ending.  If you are looking for a great unfinished story, this one is for you
Although I often disagree with the 'New Yorker' politically and find the writing of Seymour Hersh offensive I believe that the 'New Yorker' publishes exceptionally fine pieces of non- fiction. I stress the non- fiction because this is what interests me in 'the New Yorker now'.Once it was the fiction of Salinger, Singer, of S.J. Perelman. But in recent years it has been the writing of Malcolm Gladwell, Adam Gopin and a number of others.  --- This is without speaking of the special feeling of class the New Yorker gives, its still topnotch cartoons, the 'On the Town' feature, and the first-rate 'Talk of the Town ' calendar
I owned this lens for about a year before upgrading to the image stabilized f/2.8 version.  Overall I was very happy with the f/4 lens and miss having it available because of the significantly lower weight.  Sharpness is amazing and comparable for both lenses, and the f/4 can provide plenty of background blur.  If you are shooting mostly outdoors I would recommend the f/4. 
As soon as I walked out of the theater I declared that I had to own a copy of this movie.  I had to wait a long time for it to be released to DVD (it was in theaters in late winter but they didn't put it to DVD till almost a year later...probably hoping to capitalize on awards' season reviews and recommendations).  It was well worth the wait.   ---  --- It is a shame that this film was overlooked with the awards.  I think that the timing of the release factored in but maybe it just appeals to some people (like me) more than others.  The entire ensemble does a great job. ---  --- I just rewatched it and I still enjoy it after at least 6 viewings.  It would make a wonderful addition to your video collection, especially if you are a Michael Douglas fan.  (And having a Pittsburgh connection helps too...the movie really captured a lot of the essence of Pittsburgh even with the weather when there is snow on the ground, the sun is peeking through and it is raining all at the same time!).  It is just a good movie all around and should appeal to viewers who enjoy smart films. ---  --- There are just truly funny scenes and some really touching parts.  What a wild journey these characters find themselves on over the span of just one weekend.  I think the best part is that it isn't non stop action and things don't get so out of the realm of possibility.  It still retains a good touch of believability, even as some pretty unbelievable things happen. ---  --- Pick up the soundtrack while you are at it.  Bob Dylan's "Things Have Changed" is great (and it recieved an Oscar).  It is mostly a CD to just kick back and relax to. 
In general I've been happy with Belkin accessories, but this cable is the pits. It lasted less than a month! I used it to connect my HD/DVR cable box to my receiver. No crimps, kinks, or undue stress on it, but within 30 days my audio went from spotty to noticeable gaps to nonexistent. ---  --- I don't like to support the Monster Cable hype, but because of their lifetime warranty I bought their cable to replace this one. So far no problems
Like so many Hollywood movies -- especially anything made after the late 60s, when America's teen-agers and collegiate students started taking their typically youthful antiestablishmentarianism with them into the future -- this is another passionate rage against the allegedly oppressive machine.  See The Shawshank Redemption, see Dead Poet's Society, see With Honors -- filmdom's lock-step march against authority is a mainstay of the past three or four decades.  Naturally, this movie is revered as something of a paragon if not a modern pioneer of the trend.  In regular Hollywood fashion, Nurse Ratched (the chief antagonist) and the cuckoos' restrictive environment are portrayed with just enough ambiguity to deflect charges that the movie is a paranoid feast for leftist sensibilities -- which it is, of course.  Unlike most fare of this sort, it is at least very competently crafted (the director and the actors sympathize with the source material enough to give it their all), which no doubt explains how it won one or two more of those little golden trophies than it would have gotten otherwise.  -- M. Cooper
Plot Summary: A man-without-a-memory found floating in the Mediterranean Sea searches for his identity, discovering along the way pieces to the puzzle that ultimately paint him as a highly-trained government assassin. ---  --- Reason for the Rating: Violence and some language. ---  --- Based on the Robert Ludlum-authored book by the same name, THE BOURNE IDENTITY is part action flick, part stylized thriller. In his first role as an erstwhile action hero, Matt Damon shines as Bourne, imbuing the character with both an appropriate edginess and a comfortable-in-his-own-skin-even-though-he-doesn't-know-who-he-is ease. --- As the story opens, Bourne is pulled out of the Mediterranean Sea and treated for suspicious bullet wounds by the crew of an Italian fishing boat. The "hey, this is a story about espionage" theme is introduced early as a crew member removes a tiny implant from Bourne that displays what we later learn is a Swiss bank account number. Upon finding and opening the safe deposit box, Bourne discovers multiple passports (including one with the name Jason Bourne), a variety of foreign currency, and a gun. He then begins his search to uncover his true identity--and until now, so does the audience. --- If there is one misstep in THE BOURNE IDENTITY, it may be the fact that early scenes involving the CIA and the agency's frantic attempts to track him down give audience members the answer to Bourne's identity far earlier than Bourne himself. At this point the film becomes more of a "how will he survive?" thriller rather than a "who am I?" mystery. --- A love interest of sorts (played nicely by Run Lola Run actress Franka Potente) gives Bourne a "partner in crime" to play off of for much of the movie, but her role seems more of a plot contrivance rather than a reasonable or logical plot development. An implied (off-screen) love scene for the two is just as implausible as it is brief, but doesn't detract too much from the action. --- The most interesting (and morally significant) moment in the film comes when Bourne finally remembers who he is as well as the mission he was on. Through this pivotal flashback (and some foreshadowing that finally makes sense), we learn that the highly-trained killing machine isn't capable of pulling the trigger upon seeing his assassination target's children in the room with him. Bourne's hesitation nearly costs him his life and sets the course for the film's premise as he is shot, falling into the Mediterranean Sea. --- Smartly directed, THE BOURNE IDENTITY is fast-paced without feeling rushed. The Cinematographer paints the European setting in shades of grays and yellows, giving the movie a unique noir-like look that fits well with the drama. As an action film decorated with whodunit sensibilities, this film is a winner for older teens and adults. ---  --- Nappaland.com Recommends: Ignore the plot contrivances and just enjoy the ride--THE BOURNE IDENTITY is a worthy discovery. ---  --- After the Show...If members of your family choose to view this movie, use these questions to spark discussion about it afterward: --- ---What do you think prompted Jason Bourne to pause when he was preparing to shoot his assassination target on the yacht? What does this say about Bourne's moral compass? --- ---How would you feel if you suddenly couldn't remember who you were? What actions would you take to discover your identity? --- ---When faced with the horror of who he really is and what he has done, Jason Bourne longs for a chance to erase his past and start his life anew. When have you felt that way? How can a relationship with Jesus give us a "second chance" in the truest sense? ---  --- S
Ignore the big word "Karaoke" on the cover and the microphone shown, this is just a music CD, it does not display anything in a karaoke player
This magazine does a great job of featuring good articles at the beginning and then breaking down events you might want to do in New York City that week. The magazine is organized into various categories that are color coded so that when you get it, you can just skip to the section you're interested in. There's a whole city out there to discover and TONY can help point you in the right direction
I like it,but I don't like box's watch which obsolescence.I hope my boy friend will love it
This perfume deserves negative stars. I was in Macy's when I saw this fragrance on the Dior counter. The bottle is gorgeous, and I really like Hypnotic Poison and Miss Dior Cherie, so I figured I would give this one a try. I really should have smelled directly from the bottle before spraying it on my skin. It is HORRIBLE. White floral scents are generally not my thing, but I can usually tolerate them. This was the worst perfume I ever smelled. It's way too powdery and it smells so cheap. I was stuck with it on my wrist all day and it kept making me sneeze. Disgusting. Not worth the money at all. If you want to buy this scent, I would recommend buying Dove Deodorant Spray instead. It's much cheaper and smells exactly the same. I wonder if it really is the Dove Deodorant but repackaged...hmm..
I'm the consumer of SanDisk USB flash drives. I have used couple of sandisk flash drives (i.e. 512MB Mini, 256MB Mini) before I bought this product.  ---  --- Performance wise this particular product is not doing good. It's taking long time to copy files from my computers. Even it's taking long time to delete files from this disk. So I returned to Amazon and looking for Mini products from SanDisk. ---  --- I doubt all the Micro products which is having capacity more than 512MB. Now I'm planning to buy 512MB or 1GB SanDisk Mini USB flash drive.   ---  --- Better buy some good one than wasting your time on this product
I have about two to three years of Knit N Style (2001 - 2003)Magazines, and lately have spent a lot of time looking through them for a Cardigan Pattern to Knit for myself.  I haven't found a single one.  All of the patterns have serious faults: Drop Shoulders, (totally unacceptable) little or no armhole, neck and/or shoulder shaping. Most sleeves have little or no cap. And, worst of all, they are all made in five or more pieces. Haven't any of these "designers" heard of Elizabeth Zimmerman?  I was going to give the lot to the library, but am wondering if perhaps the trash might be a better place.  If you are trying to attract new knitters from among younger people, why don't you teach them the PROPER way to knit?  Young people are smarter than you think
There aren't many games now-a-days that can get me interested enough to play regularly, but Dominions 2 is one that definitely does. ---  --- It's a multiplayer, multi-platform (Mac, Windows, Linux), turn-based strategy game. There is a tun of different strategies to go with, many nations, magic items, spells, different units. Excellent game for a hardcore strategy person. ---  --- The only drawback is the interface. It's certainly not perfect and takes a bit to get used to. But there is lots of documentation online to help with that kind of stuff. ---  --- I'd highly recommend this game to anyone who likes a good multiplayer turn-based strategy. It's the best I've ever played (and I've played quite a few
I had not idea that you could order that magazine directly from them until I bought one from our local Super Market. I was surprised at the difference that I had already paid to order from Amazon and what it was there.  I canceled my order and ordered from them.  --- Some items are much less on Amazon and some are much more. You just have to be careful.  --- A magazine is a magazine no matter where it comes from.
We purchased this gate for use with our youngest of four daughters.  The pressure gates we already had were difficult for our 3 and 5 year olds to get pass and it gets difficult constantly lifting them over the gate.  This gate is well worth the money.  The remote unit is on the wall in a place where everyone can reach it, except for the 13 month old of course.  It is so much easier for everyone.   ---  --- With all of the use our gate gets, the spot welds broke one day.  You really miss this gate when you have to go back to using a pressure gate again.  I called customer support, concerned because I do longer had my receipt or even the box.  The spot welds breaking loose was a problem they hadn't had reported before (so this apparently isn't a common problem!)  I was told we would receive a new gate within two weeks and the old one would be inspected by engineers to determine what had occured.  I was very impressed!  I will be sure to check out Evenflo products first when purchasing any new child/baby products for their customer support alone.  Service like that is not so common anymore.  Like I said, great concept and service
I bought these earrings as a gift for my sister and the first time she wore them the post fell off. I felt like the biggest loser. When I contacted Amazon, they said that because it was over 2 months that I had bought the earrings I couldn't return them. What a rip off. These earrings don't even deserve 1 star
I am highly sceptical myself when it comes to skincare products.  I received this as a gift after trying the mask of magnaminty (also good).  I was blown away by how this product made my skin feel.  I have used every product under the sun and am a regular proactiv customer.  This scrub was great for my oily skin and left it feeling really clean and soft.  I am totally hooked!  You will love it too...totally worth the money
Excellent program.  I love the improvement in Outloo
i'm new to the world of smoking, and ordered this for when i dont feel like doing the whole charcoal thing.  it works fairly well and the flavor is great, but not quite as much as you get from using a charcoal grill.  i think it was designed to be placed on either side of the grill...i've opted to slide the grates to the sides and place the smoker in the middle...it seems that less smoke escapes the grill this way.  a worthwhile purchase
I have only played this game for what 20 minutes and in the first 5 fell in love w/the game.I liked the stage where you can get on to the Great Wall of China(I think thats what it is).And my dad played this and for 4 minutes and gave the wii a 8/10!He said it could go up if he played more.The controls are so easy and fun!!!I highly recommend this to any wii gamer or person who is getting a wii
I love this perfume because it really lifts my mood.  I always thought of it as a little more citrus-y, but it's just a very fun perfume.  It's also nice because it's fun and flirty but still mature in a young professional type of way--if that makes any sense.  Ultimately, it's a great perfume, and I wear it almost daily
These diapers are the most awfulest things I think I ever bought for my baby. I received a lot of the "swaddler" size for my baby shower and I tried to use them for about 3 weeks before my pediatrician pinpointed it as the source of the relentless diaper rash my son had pretty much from birth. Stopped using them and lo and behold, diaper rash gone. Fast forward 3 months later when my son was hospitalized for a week and these were the only diapers the hospital supplied. Figuring that my son was older, maybe they wouldn't do as much harm. Wrong. The rash came back with a vengeance. I had to get diapers from home for the rest of the stay. I think it's because they are lightly scented with green dye inside. Definitely stay away if your child has sensitive skin
I used to buy this off the shelf each month, but last November, my wife bought me a subscription.   I bought the December issue,...cause it hadn't arrived by mail yet. No problem.  In January, I received the November issue.   A few weeks later, in early February, I received the December issue, but not the January, so I went out and bought the January.   By the end of February, still hadn't received the Feb yet, so bought it.  Then, received the January issue and a few weeks later the February.   I was fed up.   I know they were getting 'caught up', but not only was I getting editions that I'd already bought off the shelf, but I figured these were counting against my 12 issues.     I cancelled.  They deducted a few bucks from my refund for "issues received" and had no apologies for the mess. ---  --- I like the magazine, but I will say that if you read it over time, it become redundant.   The suggested work-outs are mostly rehashes of past work-out routines.  Lets face it...there are only so many ways to work out and when you get right down to it, you gotta hit it hard and often, change things up, etc...bla bla bla...   The BEST part of the magazine are the few pages they dedicate to the correct way to execute a lift or detail what muscles are hit.   Lots of Weider ads...but then its a Weider publication, so what can you expect... ---  --- I'd buy it off the shelf because you'll eventually get tired of the same old thing...and their subscription program is iffy. ---  --- -
My daughter had to stay in the hospital for 3 weeks.  She got very used to being swaddled, but after 4 kids I still can not do it right. This blanket makes her so comfortable she sleeps 5 to 6 hours at night at 3 weeks old. When both the blankets were in the wash she wouldn't sleep that long. She was up about every 90 minutes just wanting to be held. Thank god for this blanket it lets me get some sleep
This camera is incredibly frustrating.  I must admit that under ideal lighting conditions outdoors on a moderate to fully sunny day, the camera takes wonderful pictures.  However, photos using indooor and mixed lighting conditions leave alot to be desired.  If you want to take any indoor pictures with natural light, this is not the camera for you.  The reason being is that if the flash is not activated or the lighting is not perfect, the camera slows down the shutter speed considerably.  Since the camera does not have very good image stabilization (if any) indoor pictures are blurry unless you have the hands of a surgeon.  Of course you can use the flash, but then your subject will be overlit, while the background is pitch dark.  And forget about taking long range pictures indoors (i.e. at a graduation ceremony or wedding) because if the flash is on, you will get a black picture because the camera does not compensate the shutter speed for distance, it only adjusts to whether or not it thinks the flash is on.  If it is off, your picture will be blurred because the shutter stays open for 1-2 seconds.  Since I take alot of indoor pictures, this camera is worthless to me.  If you only plan to take outdoor pictures in ideal light, this is the camera for you.  If you want to do any natural light photography, forget it. 
 I bought a sight from Airsplat for my son's airoft rifle as a Christmas gift. The screws were too short to attach it to his Kitty Kat ( a shortened M-4) airsoft rifle's weaver rail. Yes, I could go out and find screws the proper length, but I though I'd make Airsplat do their job.  ---  --- So, after several e-mails with the service department, they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size. Wrong. The diameter of the new screws is so big they won't fit through the mounting bracket on the sight. Obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws.  ---   --- Why by a gun from these guys? If it arrives broken, you pay to ship it back. Want a refund? You pay a 15% restocking fee. Take a pass on Airsplat. 
I am an honest seller and I insure 100% satisfaction to my customers.  I can also ship out a better quality beanie visor hat for you.  ---   --- Please withdraw the feedback: -JTF Trading ---  --- Don't bother. I bought a better product from OldGlory. The feedback stays. People should know what they are buying. -Me ---  --- "Not a problem.  1 feedback doesn't hurt us at all because all of our other customers know about our products and our excellent customer service." -JTF Trading ---  --- Well, I guess all I can do is you "other customers" know what a POS this hat was. That, and I had the hassle of this guy emailing me after I thought I made it clear that the matter was closed.  ---  --- Try OldGlory for a better deal and a better product
I have subscribed for years to this - in my opinion, the hand's-down best, most balanced and useful periodical on dog care and behavior available.  Practical, solidly researched, non-preachy and impeccably edited, it provides even-handed coverage of almost everything that contributes to a dog's happiness, well-being and ability to be a good companion.  The annual dog-food ratings alone are worth the subscription price.  Every constituency should be as well-served by a publication as dog lovers are by this one
I highly recommend this bundle for the price.  For less than the cost of an offical Verizon travel charger, you get a travel charger, home charger and a USB cable with driver CD.  Everything works just fine.  The instructions for the USB cable are very lacking, so here are my suggestions:  you can use Windows Media Player to move music over to your phone using the Sync feature, and you can use a free program such as BitPim to do other file transfers between your PC and phone. 
It's my first semester teaching a general-student Jazz History course, and I wanted something beyond the textbook to get the students involved.  I bought this video as a "best-of-all-options" choice, and was  bowled over by it's thoroughness and attention to detail.  Everything we'd  discussed about Armstrong during class was there on the tape, reinforcing  my lectures and giving the kids a nice opportunity to both hear AND see the  legendary Louis.  For pure entertainment alone it was worthwhile, but for  instructional purposes I'd consider it a necessity for any future jazz  classes I'd teach.  I paid $16 bucks for it, but having seen it I think  I'd've paid fifty!  (Shh!  Don't tell Amazon!
My 3 year old son received this as a Christmas gift last year and he loves it.  He explores outside and collects things from the yard and hauls them around in the truck.  Must say the truck is durable, it stays out on the deck and the weather doesn't effect it.  We hose it down to clean it, no issues there.  Highly recommend
We bought this for our 3 year old daughter for Christmas.  We turned it on right away and she was very excited until the sound suddenly started to fade out.  We thought it was just a case of dead batteries, so we replaced the batteries - several times - until we realized the product was just bad.  When trying to get it replaced, we were told they were out of stock and our money would be refunded instead.  Needless to say, our daughter was very sad and we will not be buying this product anywhere, ever.  We'll just stick with another type of keyboard to help our daughter develop a love of music
This is a classic style work boot which used to be a lot more common than now, even appearing in one episode of "Leave It To Beaver" in the late '50s, and on the cover of one of Simon and Garfunkles albums of the late '60s. I've owned several pair of similar boots by other makers, including Red Wing. Some comments which apply to this style in general, (and not just Wolverines): Pros - The wedge sole absorbs a lot of shock making them great for standing/working on concrete, or walking long distances on hard surfaces. Also, the non-agressive tread means that dirt and grass doesn't track into the house after doing chores outside. The moc toe tends to breath through the seams, so feet tend to stay cooler and drier in hot, dry conditions. A great boot for the desert, and apparantly highly esteemed by many construction workers.  --- Cons - The wedge sole doesn't offer much traction for serious hiking on steep, loose surfaces (which I've used them for, but for which they really weren't intended). Gravel will roll right out from under them. None of the several brands I have owned were water-resistant at all. Walking through wet grass will lead to wet socks very quickly, as the seams around the toe which allow air and perspiration to escape also allow outside moisture to enter just as easily. We used to say "Your feet get wet two days BEFORE it rains". So, perhaps not the best choice for hiking in the Pacific Northwest. --- Specifically, the Wolverines were extemely comfortable right out of the box. They have a better insole than any of my previous boots of this style, a removeable polyurethane contoured cushion which provides good arch support. The color was actually more of a brown clay, rather than what I would call tan. The quality of workmanship appeared to be pretty good, actually better looking stitching than my Red Wings. However I was disappointed in the variable nature of the leather. The leather in most of the boot appeared to be adequately thick, however the leather used in the shaft around the ankles was thinner than I have ever seen in any work boot, thinner even than in many suede sneakers. While my ankles were covered, they didn't feel at all supported or protected. --- After considering for a couple of days, I decided to return the boots to the merchant who provided them for Amazon, The Sportsmans Guide. They had provided a return shipping label in the box, so I taped the box closed, applied the label, and took it to the Post Office. I received an email a few days later acknowledging their receipt of the package, and a notice of a credit applied to my account. --- So, while I'm not very excited about the particular pair of boots which I received, I do give good marks to Sportsmans Guide for a quick and relatively painless return.  ---  I ended up purchasing the Georgia SPR 6" Farm and Ranch boot, with wedge sole, also available through Amazon.

I was surprised by some unexpected guests for dinner.  I had not opened the jar before, so I wasn't sure how to use it.  I decided to pour it over boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cover the dish with tin foil and bake.  It was a hit!!  Even my husband liked it, and he is very picky and stuck on old favorites.  I just bought a couple more jars. --- 
The steamer works very, very well. Sure beats paying for, or even just the hassle of taking your stuff to the jeweler and wondering if you got back what you took in. Great gadget
My son is a college student in Boston and excitedly brought this board game home on one of his breaks. "You've GOT to play this game!" he said. It had been years since anyone could even so much as coax me over to a table where a board game was being played. But I wanted to spend time with my son so I consented to learn it. Turns out, it was amazing! My husband, 13-year-old son, the bringer-of-this-new-addiction and myself must have played it 20 times in the 3 weeks he was home. The "board" is different every time you play it so nothing is predictable, rolls of the die dictate one's success, trading and strategies can get intense and the more you play it, the more you definitely like it. Alas! I've "settled" into Catan mode and no longer need to beg him to bring it home from school.  I bought my own house copy plus the expansion so we can get visitors hooked on it, too. We play it all the time. Cross my heart, this is fun. As my son said, "You've GOT to play this game!"  
Metallica never recovered from the death of Cliff Burton, as this album is prime evidence of.  He helped to bring depth to the songs that is not present here.  Also, Newstead only gets one song on this album, which is ironically the best song on the album.  In the history of Metallica, this album marks the transition from artistic song writing to commercial
I begged to see this movie in 1985! I was only 14 but I knew I had to see it and buy the soundtrack. (remember cassettes?)  Never has Rob Lowe or Emilio Estevez looked better! Hot, Hot, Hot!!  No this isn't Oscar worthy or anything, but if you are a die-hard 80's Brat packer, this is the one!  
I bought this for my 5  year old daughter and we tried to take very good care of it.  Within a few days of careful use, one of the latches bent, a hinge broke off and a piece of the edge came unglued.  It is a great idea, but needs better construction.  On a positive note, my daughter loved it and would have spent hours drawing and creating with the tools inside if I let her.  However, I had to take the box away so further damage does not occur before I can fix it.  The drawers work fine.  The problem is with the two doors on top that flip out.  Note about drawers; Little plastic door knobs pop out.  Need to be glued in. 
Garbage metal - music for the American mainstream to feed on.  I saw them open for Slayer about 4-5 years back, and they had about 5 guys on stage doing nothing except JUMPING UP AND DOWN.  How pathetic !  ---  --- Pick up some real metal.... like old Kreator. 
I was hoping that Miller would turn his talents from the dark side and we would see how well he could reproduce a Classical Epic.  What we get is a blood splattered "300 Lacedaimons in the Hood".  The Spartans are presented to be a buch of Homo erotic Rastafarians.  The Persians rather than the Noble Middle Eastern Autocrats presented in their Art are drawn by Miller to resemble African American Gangstas with piercings and Skin art everywhere.  I was looking for Xerxes to have a grill and whitewalls on his chariot. ---  --- If you were into "Sin City", you will love this mishmashed version of the Classical Tale of bravery and sacrifice in the face of overwhelming odds
I have never been able to see what the big deal was about this band.  All of their records, in general, sound exactly the same, and this one is no exception.  Post-Velvets guitar/organ drones, lackadaisical vocals, blankly uninteresting non-lyrics (they could have recited their grocery lists and it would have been more interesting), and a dramatic lack of energy; all of Yo La Tengo's trademarks are fully represented here, and if you can stay awake through it, you're a better man/woman than I.  A surpassingly boring record, even from this usually very boring band.  If you've heard the Velvet Underground, Neu!, Stereolab's early records, and Sonic Youth, you've heard Yo La Tengo in total.  If you're a big enough fan of those named bands, YOU could probably write songs that sound like "Painful." But you would probably write better ones. Avoid this like the plague unless you suffer from insomnia
Yes, I must admit that I was fooled by the "One of the most notorious, most debated, most banned films of the 'video nasty' era." line on this back of this movie case.  I was lucky because I found this at a Best Buy for $10.99.  It should be $2.99 for as bad as it is.  I've been let down by these Italian Horror Films one too many times.  If you want good, gore filled, Italian Horror stick with Lucio Fulci or Dario Argento.  Once you get past the bad dubbing and acting they're berrible.  Oh, by the way, unless you are fluent in Italian this second disk is almost worthless-there is no opportunity to even have English subtitles.  The only thing good about the second disk is the nudity and strong sexual content and that looks alright in any language
This Is a cool gun BUT...Has NO acuracy and the instruction manual is really hard to read i like it as a side arm but only in tight situations
We looked everywhere for this float after borrowing one while swimming at the lake with our 11 month old.  The nice thing about it is that it provides a safe and comfortable ride while allowing the child to be right in the water and splash around.  We can swim right alongside and spin him around or swim underneath to come and suprise him from the other side.  We don't have to worry much about the water being too deep because the float is so stable.  I would say the only drawback is that while it inflates fairly easily, squeezing all the air out and collapsing the float can take a few tries.  I would recommend this product to anyone with an older baby who wants to take their child for a float in calm water
Everything was great about this from the product to the promptness which it was received.
Unlike many of my friends this was not a traumatic time for me. However it took quite some time before I could read anything about the era. Now that it is so long ago that it is sort of a dream I wonder if I should have kept up with this magazine.  ---  --- I now find it intriguing and wish there was more on the area I was in. The major players are displayed but not so much the more personal information.  ---  --- Yet I have friends that were in many of the groups depicted in this magazine and it like any other specialty magazine of a time and place can hold special moments for them. ---  --- There is also a good magazine for people that missed their chance to take place in Vietnam in that time in history. ---  --- As with any experience if you ere not there then you can not know but this comes closest to an objective telling of history.  ---  --- Be sure not to overlook the ads as they are an intricate part of the magazine and offer some interesting items. ---  --- 1/10 th Cavalry 1967-68 Armed Recon.
This is an all-time favorite tea of mine. I spend hundreds of dollars a year on tea - and this tea really hits the spot in my favorite top ten list of teas. The only downfall about this tea is that it is not made with strings. I like to have strings on my bags of tea. But no matter what this is the best peppermint tea i've ever drank! ---  --- Celestial Seasonings is a great brand. ---  --- This tea will smell up your kitchen with a lovely invigorating scent. Perfect for the mornings.  ---  --- I also use this tea when my stomach is upset, if my joints are sore, to help with cramps, and to help with gas! Peppermint is a natural reliever for IBS, especially if you have the flu or a bad cold peppermint tea really seems to bring up your spirits and relieve stomach irritations
I have been using this product for about 3 months.  It is great!  Not only have I noticed a difference, but I get comments from people all the time about how refreshed I look.  I had a baby about 5 months ago and decided that I need to pamper myself a little.  I came across this product in January and was very cautious about purchasing another eye cream.  Nothing has worked in the past.  However, I decided to give it a try.  I noticed changes after a couple of weeks, but wasn't sure if it was just me wanting it to work or it actually working.  Well, now after 3 months, I can totally tell the difference.  I look so much better even without makeup.  I don't even need to put concealor under my eyes any more!!!  Plus, I receive so many great comments from people. ---  --- Thank you Hylexin.  Finally something that worked for me
I got Shrek 2 a couple christmases (is that right?) ago, and i gotta say it was alright. the pros are that it is up to four players ( so if dad wants to spend "quality" time with junior), it has a wide variety of fun characters, and plenty of levels.   ---  --- HOWEVER, it lacks graphics, and young children might not do well during the game. but overall its alright ---  --- Graphics: C/ It must have been released early, cuz it's pretty bad --- Sound: B+/ crisp sounds. the sound really matches the mood. --- Controls: A-/ Changing and controlling characters' a breeze ---  --- Good for children and adults to
Before you get all worked up, let me say that he has a voice, but he really doesn't have a style.  he sings songs way too straight, he makes even Bobby Short sound like an improviser!  He also doesn't seem to be in touch with his masculine side, his vocie is very, well if ying is male, and yang is female, he sounds very yang.  He needs to take some liberties with the songs he sings and then he won't sound so obnoxious, then he needs to take some vocal lessons and try to bring out the ying(masculine side) in his voice.  He needs to hear a few Billy Eckstine lp's.  I don't think he can change but here's hoping he'll take my advice.  As far as you buying this cd it is your decision, this is just my honest opinion
I'm in love with these sandals.  Although they are very lightweight, they are vastly more substantial, supportive and comfortable than most flip-flops.  I may have to buy another pair.  If you're a half-size, go down not up
This ab machine focuses your workout on the abdominal muscles like not many other ab machines do.  You'll be surprised by the results
I bought this for a quick trip based on the good reviews and the fact that the new Fodor's isn't out yet. This has a lot of beautiful pictures and good background explanations, but isn't great if you actually want to see much beyond holy sites and ruins. the maps are not comprehensive enough (the one for modern jerusalem  didn't cover a third of the city, and the one for tel aviv was tiny), and there is not enough practical information about food, hotels, and getting from place to place. I was disappointed.
This review is for the Coolpix 5900 with 5MP.  --- You will not be displeased with this camera if you are in the  --- market for a compact digital camera. This little baby lies  --- comfortably in your pocket until you want it and rarely fails  --- to deliver, no matter what lighting obstacles you throw in it's  --- path. The footprint is amazingly small for a 5MP and you'll be  --- amazed at the functionality. I found the video/movie feature to  --- be a real useful tool that surprises most people with the great  --- clarity and utterly blown-away at night shots in poor light.  --- Think of Las Vegas lights on the strip, or a crowd of people  --- in thin night light. This camera handled it all. The SD card  --- is easy to access, and I recommend a 1GB size so you can take  --- your time with movies. Otherwise a 512MB card will give you  --- about 300 photos. But I warn you, you will be bitten by the  --- movie bug and want to use this more and more (provided you have  --- disk space or burn the excess to DVDs). I also recommend the  --- San Disk Ultra II SD cards for fast recovery speeds, so you  --- don't have to wait for each shot to record before going to the  --- next shot (this is 5 MP and that's a lot of pixals to store).  --- The roll on the side of the body enables you to keep a tight  --- grip on it with one hand shots- a feature many small cameras  --- lacked. The battery life is exceptional, but as always, buy a  --- backup for travel. The hit of one star was for the frustratingly small on/off button. I know they designed it so that it won't accidentally turn on in your pocket, but my fat finger is not the best tool.... The 2 inch LCD is not protected like others too, but so far seems pretty tough, rolling around in my pocket with sunglasses and other things that so far have not scratched it. 
As we near the end of the life span of the last generation of consoles, key franchises that have appeared year after year begin to wrap up their yearly development cycle. Crazy as it may sound, Madden NFL 07 could be one of the last times we see Madden on the Xbox, PlayStation 2, or the GameCube. With that in mind, it's not altogether surprising that Madden 07 doesn't really push the envelope terribly far. The game includes a few new control features and some mode tweaks (nearly all of which are also available in the Xbox 360 version of this year's game), but for the most part, it feels like the result of a series pushed as far as it can possibly go on a given platform, and you definitely get the sense that Madden on current-generation consoles is beginning to wind down. However, for at least this last year, the veteran player outraces the up-and-comer in the Xbox 360 version, and there are certainly enough compelling reasons to check this year's game out on the older consoles.  ---   --- Madden NFL 07 brings back practically every feature that was in Madden 06. On top of that, a number of new gameplay upgrades have been brought to the table, the majority of which are available in all versions of the game. By themselves, none of these individual changes or upgrades is particularly game changing, but taken as a whole, they add a nice dimension of depth.  ---  --- These features include the highlight stick, a new kick meter, and lead blocking controls. The highlight stick is a new version of the truck stick used for runners on offense. Here, you can use the right control stick to pull off the sorts of crazy jukes and steps that star running backs are so well known for, and on top of that, depending on the type of back you're playing, you can opt to use more-powerful moves, or more finesse-based maneuvers. This feels like the natural evolution of last year's truck stick, though most experienced Madden players will be able to get by just as easily using the button-based moves rather than making liberal use of the stick. But if you take the time to learn the stick and figure out how to use it and the button controls together, you can be a very hard runner to stop.  ---  --- The new lead blocking controls are likely to inspire some new tactics from all types of players. Here, while on offense, you can opt to switch your controlled player to any of the available blockers during a running play. This includes offensive linemen, tight ends, fullbacks, or whoever else might be blocking on a play. When blocking, you can just do standard blocks, or you can even get dirty and do some mean-spirited cut blocks. This is an interesting mechanic, because it stops you from having to rely on CPU blockers, which as any experienced player will tell you, are not always the most reliable players on the field. You can also quickly switch back to control the running back once you've laid down your block, which is good, because the CPU running back doesn't always manage to find the holes you're creating. At first, you may find yourself unable to effectively use this feature, as setting up the right blocks isn't always the most intuitive thing in the world. But after some time, this control method gives the running game a really interesting new perspective, and those who love finding new strategies are bound to eat this up.  ---   --- The new kick meter is probably the most accurate representation of kicking available in a game thus far. With this meter, you use the typical arrow to line up your angle and then press down on the right analog stick to set up your power. The meter quickly fills up, and then you press forward on the right stick to set the power as well as your accuracy. The accuracy is based on the angle at which you press up. If you press too far to the right or left, the kick will get away from you. If you land it within a set space, it will go pretty much right where you want it to.  ---  --- Beyond that, the changes from 06 to 07 are mostly ancillary, and fundamentally, the game plays very much as its predecessor did. On defense, there are a few more available options in terms of positioning your defensive players, and you can commit your defense in a certain direction the moment the ball is snapped. On offense, the quarterback vision cone, which made its debut last year, is still available, though it's not a required feature. You can just tap the right analog stick after snapping the ball, and it will pop on, letting you use it for a little accuracy boost. No, it's not any more fun to use than it was last year, but that's not altogether surprising. Otherwise, pretty much every control feature you've come to expect from Madden is front and center once again. Potentially, some people could play through Madden 07 and never really partake in the new running control features, but there's definitely enough in all the available upgrades to add a significant layer of depth to the experience.  ---  --- Even though Madden NFL 07 doesn't have any big, game-changing features to make it an especially memorable iteration of the series, its roster of small, but useful changes are ultimately more compelling than anything Madden 06 had on offer last year. And while some people are undoubtedly over the notion of playing new games on old consoles, Madden 07 shows that it can still deliver some enjoyable football, regardless of what platform it's on. It's not a big step forward, and the similarities between this year and last year might be a tough sell for some. But it's those similar aspects that Madden 07 ultimately improves upon over its predecessor, and if you skipped out on 06, then there's no good reason to ignore 07.  --- 
For the price of this cradle/swing, I'd hoped for a lot more quality and reliability than I got.  First, the stand seemed a little wobbly--you really need to make sure that the feet are as wide as possible when setting it up as they don't lock into an optimal position.  Even worse, however, is that after less than two days of use, the lights, sound, and mobile stopped working.  Calls to "customer service" were a complete waste of time and I ended up returning the item.  While the netting and other features appeared attractive and desirable, I'd have to recommend purchasing a less expensive Papasan cradle/swing
This is the best game ever! If you want to play with your love ones, this is the best game to have with. You can be addicted to it sometimes, but that's a good sign for a good gam
The refills were easy to order & fit my brush perfectly.  It's a lot easier ordering on line & received in home rather than trying to find the merchandise in a store
It is a magnificient item! So simple and beautiful yet full of really small details and "hello, here is Johnny Cash!"  --- Looks really great on foot with his guitar. Just like real. I strongly recommend it to all Cash fans
Not Only Black + White is a great Australian magazine, and of top quality.  I used to buy it in bookstores here in New Zealand, but they don't seem to be available here anymore.  I am not subscribing to it, but I'd keep getting them if they were available in bookshops where I live.  I emailed the publisher twice about this, but I didn't get any response.  Aside from that, this is a great mag (yes, it has fine art nude pictorials as well as lots more) and one that you would hang on to like a "coffee table" book rather than treat like a typical magazine.  It has a thicker cover and pages than normal magazines too.  For a magazine, you could almost rate it a 5, but nothing beats a proper book (no advertising, etc), so I rate this a 4.  Aside from the photography, it also makes a good reference for page layout and typographical ideas as well, for anyone into desktop publishing
Granted this was on sale for 20 bucks, it was originall 75, it's poorly made, difficult to assemble and very uncomfortable to use
This film starts with an event based on a true crime. A talk radio show host in Denver was killed by an American Nazi. (This event inspired the "Talk Radio" play and film.) This film continues with scenes from a small town in a farming region. No mention of their economic status; are they losing dollars and population, small businesses, etc. Instead we see a small group of white racists who abduct a black man to hunt and kill him! This seems too exaggerated to believe. Federal agents are aware of this but don't want to act yet. Their agent is sent back to get more information. There are groups like that in some sparsely settled areas. The film doesn't explain what created them. It shows how some politicians try to use them for votes and contributions. No real names, of course. ---  --- The Federal agent meets to report to her higher ups. Then we see terrorists prepare to hold up a bank to raise money for their activities (based on real events). Most bank robberies are done by ordinary criminals who are not part of any group. (The FBI put an end to organized gangs that robbed banks in the 1940s.) This Federal agency doesn't interfere because they want more information on their aims (and their leaders). More terrorism is planned: dynamiting a courthouse, attacking a power station, etc. The terrorist plots here would keep this small group busy 24 hours a day! Kathy finds a secret list of "friends". This is quickly copied with a camera. The Federal agents need to know who this group will target so they can arrest them. Gary meets with the leader (who arrives in a helicopter!) And shows documents that say Kathy is a special investigator. Is Kathy being served up as a sacrifice? Gary and Kathy travel to Chicago, where an assassination is planned that will make Gary the fall guy. (Another Lee Harvey Oswald?) A second "lone gunman" shoots the politician in front of a building. Gary fails to shoot, and won't ever try this again. ---  --- Costa-Gavras gained world fame with his 1969 film "Z". A few years later his film about rebels in South America was popular. His later films have seemed mediocre. A better story might not have tried to cover so many details and plots as this film does; better pacing could help. The threat from domestic terrorism still needs a good film (e.g., Timothy McVeigh). Those who gave this film a high rating must love the images more than the facts. ---  --- A better film today would show the bad results from "NAFTA" and "Free Trade" in harming most Americans economically. But Hollywood would never allow a film about this "war on the middle class". The word `nafta' in Greek and Arabic refers to `petroleum'. NAFTA is a symbol for the policies designed for Big Oil. It is like George W. Bush calling his policy "Operation Iraqi Liberation".
I haven't been able to find the sizing info. for the sleepsacks on this site, so I called the Right Start (they also carry them but for $24.99) and they said that the large size is for 22-28 pounds.    Just thought I'd put this info. out there for everyone - hope it helps
I am utterly disappointed in the direction that Gamepro has taken over the past two years. I actually stopped my subscription for about 1 year, but came back to the 20 issues for $10 at their (10?) year anniversary.  I forget.  But the magazine is really bad. ---  --- One thing I laugh is, the retro corner.  They have info about issues from 5 and 10 years before, and they always announce the number of pages from 10 years ago. I think the most recent issue, they said: 140 pages?  Huh?  I think my last issue was around 100.  And don't try to tell me they've lost 40 pages in advertising.  ---  --- Too bad on-line reviews and websites, are taking over the subscriptions of the hardcopy magazines. I'll stick with hardcopy until the end of my life. Or until the quality of these types of magazines gets so low, I can't stand it anymore.  Or until my subscription runs out on this craptacular effort.  ---  --- You guys were pretty good 5 years ago, but you've gone to pot these past two years!  I'm talkin' to you Watchdawg!!! ---  --- You guys are suckin' lately!!! ---  --- MC White said:  You guys are suckin'!!
Well, I bought two of this. I have only used one and it works fine. Looks very nice and feels solid in your hands.  --- The only thing i dislike is that it sounds and vibs too much for my taste, but not a big deal..
I bought this thinking it would be a kind of sports watch - for swimming and running.  Unfortunately it is not waterproof for swimming, is unbelievably bulky, and has this strange time setting system which only works in the USA and Europe (I live in Australia). In the end I gave it to a relative in the USA
I've been a loyal user of Systemworks (also "Utilities" & AntiVirus) for many years, frequently buying upgrades as I moved through various Windows OSs.  The latest verison (2006) has been a big disappointment. ---  --- 1) The "integrator" repeatedly crashes (and "must shut down").  I was told to reintall (it took 4 hours).  Tech support (email) was slow and barely intelligible. ---  --- 2) The full scan now takes over 8 hours on a modest sized system. ---  --- 3) The utilities have not been substantially improved in 5 years ---  --- 4) The rebate (for upgrade users) came in the form of a debit card, not a check.  (What a hassle!  I don't want any more "plastic"!) ---  --- 5) Turning the Norton protection off substantially speeds up my PC.  What the heck is going on back there? ---  --- During the next year, I'll be looking for a new Anti-Virus support product. ---  --- Cheers, Joh
NOtice that the people giving it 5 stars are the people who reviewed this product and this product alone. ---  --- Sounds like employees trying to build up ratings
I first stumbled across this movie on cable in the late 80's. I loved it then and still do today. Great story, great casting, great acting & great period film making. Diane Lane is not to shabby either as a strippin' diva with a taste for the fast life. Matt Dillon plays a complete craps stud who can win any dice game no matter the stakes or cash on the table. Tommy Lee Jones, Tom Skerrit, Bruce Dern & Lee Grant all contribute with awesome performances to this "Gem Club" of a movie. I sincerely hope we'll all be lucky enough for this title to be available soon on DVD. Heck, I'd love to have a DVD with tons of extras too if it was up to me but it it's not. I can always dream though..
This toy needs work ... First of all, it's HEAVY!  My daughter (now 19 months) usually likes to pick it up and throw it.  After all, it IS a ball!  We have hardwood floors - throwing this ball is extremely loud and it can really do some damage to our floors!  We don't have any problems with it moving around ... however ... when you're asked to find something on the ball, even I have a hard time finding it to push the button in time.  So, I don't know how a 6 month+ baby/child could find the correct answer in time. ---  --- I think this is a nice idea for a toy, but it just doesn't work.  It is colorful, and my daughter does enjoy throwing it, but that's obviously not it's intended use.  She never played with this toy as a crawling infant.  She only plays with it now, and she only throws it.  Please don't waste your money on this toy.  It's not worth it
This Movie was very hard to find. Found it in DVD an it was new
The field of vision is too small for any useful viewing.  If you already know where your object is in the dark, then you can point this device towards the object and view it in dark.  But if you are searching for an object in the dark, the small field of vision makes the search useless.   ---  --- Also, there is too much "noise" in the image, thus making it very difficult to recognize the object that you are viewing. ---  --- The IR makes the field of vision even smaller.   ---  --- Overall I did not find this device useful even for ordinary pleasure viewing.   ---  --- By the way, if you own a camcorder with night-view, you already know how how the objects look in the dark.  You can use your camcorder's night view feature instead of buying this expensive devic
The massage portion of this heating pad is no more a massager than the vibrate on a cell phone.  There is only 1 heat setting, which is OK, but it's a bit hot for only one setting.  It's like the High setting on my 3 setting hot pad
Do NOT!! Order from this website! I purchased a subscription for Oxygen magazine on Jan. 30, 2006, and I still have not received the first issue. I am very dissapointed, to say the least!
This notebook is fabulous...its history inspires.  I think that it will be the last type of notebook I use for my journaling and writing.  I adore it
Boomwhackers are wonderful for teaching children or adults elementary music.  They are virtually indestructible and can be use in a variety of teaching situations.  And that are very resonable in price.  I do recommend also purchasing the Octavator caps. 
This is the second item I have ordered from this company, and I am extremely pleased with the quality and value for my money. I would recommend them to anyone
Nintendo hasmaintained their status as one of the most successful video game companies ever. Since they hit it big back in the 80's, they've maintained to be as synonomous with the way we play video games just as Microsoft has IBM has maintained the computers. A couple of years ago, Nintendo revolutionary changed the way we play video games with the DS handheld system. Not only has it worked very well, but it has changed the way we played video games with the touch of a pen. Earlier this year, the company redesigned the system with the DS Lite. Now, it has been remade, and it is pretty in pink. ---  --- The Nintendo DS Lite in Coral Pink, is a video game system not only designed for the hard core gamer, but the color makes it have a femanine touch for female gamers too, from its detailed color to its elequent pink-colored stylus. The screen is very crisp and clear, and deliver beautifully in its display. The graphics are crisper and clearer than the original DS system on so many different titles from New Super Mario Brothers, the action-packed puzzler Meteos, and new games like Star Fox Command and Mario Hoops 3-on-3. Not only that, but if you're a fan of Game Boy Advance games, you can play your GBA games on the system as well. The gameplay is crisper and delivers the best control, for the system, but also a easier way to play games that original DS owners had trouble tackling. ---  --- All in all, the Nintendo DS Lite is a great video game system because it is inexpensive and convient for the die hard gamer in not just the price, but the games too. I love this system a whole lot, and if you have the desire to own a video game system, I definitely recommend this one for everyone. ---  --- Graphics: A ---  --- Sound: A ---  --- Control: A ---  --- Fun & Enjoyment: A ---  --- Price: A ---  --- Overall: A 1/2
This item worked well for a month or so, but then began working intermitently after that. Eventually it stopped working all together. In my opinion it is a pretty cheaply made item. I would not recommend it
I struggled with the decision to buy this trike, thinking it seemed kind of cheap and plastic compared to the metal trikes of my youth. However, I ended up getting one for my 3 year old, and am going to order another for when my 1 year old is old enough. Whoever invented the rear handle steering mechanism is a genius, and me and my back thank them. I no longer live in fear of "daddy push me," since pushing doesn't require bending over to that terrible "pushing a tricycle" stance. The trike itself is lightweight and easy to maneuver. It has a low center of gravity and doesn't feel quite as tipsy as some. I recommend it
You will save a lot of time by using this OCR. Top notch accuracy and very easy to use. A must for all those who need an OCR. Don't hesitate
I made the mistake of subscribing to Make, based on the hype.  It turns out to be long and tedious, with instructions on how to make really messy junk of virtually no interest or use.  Successive issues have gone down hill, and by issue 4 they were dealing in vanity pictures of people's garage workshops.  Maybe you'll be the one in a million who wants to make useless junk, but buy a copy or two at the newstand before you subscribe.  It's not obviously wonderful
I had high hopes for this stuff. I have watched Blow Out and know that he knows his stuff when it comes to hair, but I cant seem to get this stuff to actually do anything for my curls and waves. I have tried it on wet hair, damp hair, dry hair-no discernable difference. I will stick to my Frederic Fekkai products-they actually work
The toothbrush is great, feels like you just came from the dentist and had your teeth cleaned
The Diaper Dekor is the best diaper pail on the market!  It's easy to operate and stays odor-free!  To get rid of a dirty diaper, just step on the foot pedal and drop the diaper in the pail.  Completely hands-free!  You don't have to worry about twisting anything like you do with the Diaper Genie.  When the pail is full, just pull out the bag, cut it loose on the door-mounted blade, and tie a knot in the top.  Then, just tie a knot in the liner that remains in the pail and you're all set for the next batch of dirty diapers!  The "continuous liner" concept is genius!  I've been using the Diaper Dekor since my daughter's birth ... and I'm still on the same refill that came with the pail.  I did, however, stock up on refills for the future by adding them to my baby registry! :-
I use the memory card in my Samsung d807 phone.  Works perfecty
I'd give this product zero stars if I could.   ---  --- I use the QuickBooks online payment service with version 2004, and last week it started telling me that they were discontinuing support for version 2004 with that online service, so they forced me to upgrade. ---  --- So I bought the upgrade, and when I ran the installer it wouldn't accept my serial number.  I spent forty minutes on the phone with tech support on a choppy line to India, and he still couldn't get it to work.  I finally gave up when the next step he proposed was to disable all of the services running on my computer. ---  --- I had heard from others, including an accountant, that this version was bad but couldn't believe it would really be this bad.  I'd used QB since the early-1990s and never really had a problem.  But this is really, really bad. ---  --- Intuit needs to go back to the drawing board with this version.  It's a TOTAL LEMON
I bought the refills primarily for the stylus.  My PDA stylus was bothering my arm and using this is easy and painless
I bought the V2000 last year and it has worked great since then.  The compass has always given me accurate directions and has lasted through one winter and one summer so far.  I always left my V2000 in the vehicle, although the manual did state that you should take the device with you when the temperature is hot.  The V2000 has visible at all situations.  I can see it clearly in the dark with the V2000's automatic backlight, and see it clearly on a sunny day.  Finding a good place to put the temperature probe, however, is a hassle if you want to get accurate results.  Calibration was also a hassle for me.  You have to be on leveled ground and make a fairly even circle in order to get accurate readings.   
My wife had one just like this for 15 years and it was time for a new one. This back is almost identical and better quality. Shipping was very fast and it came exactly as I expected
Homesite is widely recognized as "the" premier tool for coding HTML, client side, and server side code by hand. Adding it to your resume won't land you a job, but it will certainly boost your chances of getting an interview because it indicates that you are not a cheap, WYSIWYG junkie. ---  --- One of the things I like best about Homesite 5 is the adaptability it allows when coding in ASP.NET. I was able to find a plug-in, which when added to Homesite, recognized the .NET tags and colors them accordingly. There are similar plug-ins for just about every language out there. ---  --- If you are unfamiliar with HomeSite, are considering a purchase, but are not sure it's the right tool for you, here's a very brief description on how it works: This is not a drag-and-drop design tool that created the code for you. It is, in essence, a text editor on steroids. As you code BY HAND it will color the code for you, tell you when you've made errors, offer you a ton of help on knowing what tags mean, has a built in FTP client, helps you organize your work into projects, and a bunch of other functions I've never used. ---  --- Here's the main thing you need to know: If you're a HomeSite pro, then you are also a REAL developer. ---  --- To everyone who has whined about lack of support: What do you expect for less then $100? If you purchase a flagship product from Macromedia such as Dreamweaver, Studio MX, or Fireworks, you'll get all the support you'll need. ---  --- Also, I've been able to find PLENTY of FREE support from news groups and email lists that focus on web development. For every problem or question I've found someone who knows the solution. You can too!!! ---  --- Just a note: Amazon is behind the times. From the Macromedia website you can now purchase two versions ahead of what Amazon is offering. ---  --- Well worth the $99.00
I'd been shopping for a pair of running shoes and have tried on various brands.  These shoes surpassed others in fit, support, and comfort.  I'm so glad Kayano comes in wide sizes, because it fits my feet PERFECTLY!  I highly recommend!   
Just got it yesterday. It took a few hours for the clock to adjust to correct time. It is accurate and quiet. It's a beauty too. This is the 4th La Crosse atomic clock in my house (first analog one). Recommanded
this guitar i receieved has a warped neck; how dare you send this product out
This is a wonderful (and healthful) snack.  Crispy and tasty and low in calories. Each bag equals 1/2 cup of fresh fruit, and the dried crunchiness of these seems to intensify the flavor of the fruits.  There is also enough substance to meet the munchies moments.  I highly recommend these
This sling was only useful for a couple months because there is no adjustable strap. There are so many slings out there that are more functional and that you can use from newborn to toddle
I just received my brush(es) hair dryer yesterday 3/9/07 ... tried it out today - for 5 MINUTES ... I absolutely hate it.  It's the worst, by far, hair appliance I've ever owned.  I guess you get what you pay for ... but I've owned Revlon products in the past, and this was absolutely the biggest waste of money.  I cannot return it, because the return cost would be too expensive, too much trouble, and I guess it will go in the dumpster.  I hate it - don't make the same mistake I made.  One big problem is that the bristles are so lousy - not firm and doesn't grip the hair.  Just take it from this written testimony - it's a piece of junk
I also found this item at Target for $39.99. If you buy it at amazon or ebay, your wasting your money
I'm an old school comic book collectors and I bought this in order to see what the technology has done with the print page.  This is more about collecting the stories than it is about collecting the art--and I still find there's no substitute for the feel of those magical pages
This is a great product. a friend told me about it. i finally decided to get one. i had bleeding gums. in two weeks of regular use, bleeding has stopped and i can see that my teeth is getting whiter and and my gums are great. just be careful when using the water jet side. you must turn it on with the flossing part in your mouth, or it will spray all over the place :

I washed 'em and they shrunk up so small I can't wear 'em anymore, bummer
 ---         Lips need a little shimmer in the summer, which is why I'm a fan of  Laura Mercier's Lip Glaces.  While they do come in 14 luscious shades, my two current faves are "Cancun Coral" and "Miami Pink."  The "Cancun Coral" is a soft coral which I like for day wear, and the "Miami Pink" has all the sparkle and pizzazz of hot pink - perfect for evening (especially with Mercier's Pressed Powder Bronzer). ---  ---  All the shades are abundantly blessed with Vitamin E, Lanolin and Mineral Oil to soften and smooth lips.  These glaces aren't at all heavy or sticky - they're light, go on easily, evenly, and don't bleed over lip lines if you take a bite of something good. ---  ---  Glaces can be worn alone or over lip color if you want to give added gleam to a favorite lipstick
I'd never bought a perfume above ten dollars when I tried Burberry Brit's Eau de Toilette one day. I couldn't believe how wonderful the scent was, especially after it had been on for a while. I splurged on a bottle which seems set to last me for a long time (even with almost-daily use, it's still mostly full). I consider this to be my signature scent, and get many compliments on it
We got the clock, read the instructions, installed a battery and hung it on an East / West wall.  After the sun went down, the clock was able to receive the station and set itself to the correct time.  It has worked flawlessly for the last two months since we got it.  It's nice to have the correct time all the time and the kids don't worry about getting out on time to catch the bus because the clock is off
I'm a huge fan of the majority of the Philosophy line, along with adoring the Amazing Grace scent!  I thought this scrub would be perfect for the spring into summer period because of the light floral scent.  Boy was I wrong!!   --- If you love amazing grace, this smells Nothing like it.  IT smells like plastic flowers.. not appealing at all.  Even my fiance made a comment that the bathroom smelled like melting plastic.  If you want a fantastic exfoliator, try Gingerbread Man or the Margarita scrub.. those are devine!  I think I'll stick to my amazing grace body lotion from now on
This disk is truly as bad as Nitin's previous disks were wonderful. Take any previous Nitin disk, throw in some Alpha, a bit of Craig Armstrong, some predictable eco-freindly american diatribe, mix until extremely smooth and you have a prophesy. As with most prophesies there no good news about it. My prophesy is that anyone who buys this won't ever buy another Nitin dis
I bought this card about 10 months ago to go with my Nikon D70 and I've certainly had no regrets. I haven't tried pushing the card to its limits to see how quickly it can write, but it's been plenty fast enough to keep up with me in single-shot mode. The card is always ready when I am. Downloading from the card to computer via my SanDisk Imagemate is fast too. ---  --- I like it so much, I'm buying a second one today
In 1962 Elvis was given a script that would take full advantage of his flare for comedy and "fierce" timing,...the movie was "Follow That Dream,"...and he would never see this oppurtunity again for the rest of his career.Elvis deliver's a flawless "deadpan" comedic performance that is seamless from start to finish that will remind you of a young Andy Griffith.Through the innocent eyes of Toby Kwimper,..we see a different world,..a world not so harsh and positive to the touch.In the courtroom scene that would be the climatic event of the film Elvis deliver's one of the finest speeches I have ever seen on film,...and there is not a dry eye in the house.We see through this performance that Elvis the actor needed only a suitable script and then he would keep up his end of the bargain."Follow That Dream" is a wonderful motion picture that has an endearing cast of great actors who were among the best of their time,...and it shows.This was Elvis's crowning glory,..if that he had one.A finer performance by Elvis you will not find on film,..watch him shine
After months of searching, I found the out of print cd here.  I had never heard it, but after hearing the fabulous song "My Only" from the "Good as it gets"  movie soundtrack, I had to hear the album.  What a disappointment!  Oh well, it would have been hard to make a cd as good as that song
Cheap Trick's second album is very disappointing to me after --- the good, but raw, "Live In The Studio", 1977-76 recorded --- Cheap Trick. Almost all of the material here is so watered  --- down that it REALLY COMES OFF WAY BETTER on the later many  --- Live disks they did. ---  --- After a good start w/ "Hello There", a concert favorite for  --- many years, is the only thing here to write home about when  --- one considers how great all the tunes from this overproduced album sounded on the Budokan and other Live recordings later. ---  --- Tom Werman and Rick Niesen were on a show in 1991 that I had --- recorded on a tape once and Werman, noce a friend of Tom Petersson's said, quote: "My three albums with Cheap Trick --- got better and better...", to which the ever sarcastic Rick --- Nielsen said, "Selling, maybe." Not realizing that brother --- Rick was slamming him, Werman then continued, "Exactly"... ---  --- Oh boy. We now see why producing Cheap Trick albums through --- the years has become like playing Russian Roulette. It's not --- hard to get better than this and five months later the solid, --- but somewhat oeverrated 'Heaven Tonight' came out...(And the --- guys EVEN bought Werman back for Dream Police. Things turned  --- out better when Pete Comita, then later Jon Brant joined the --- band. Yep - the best was yet to come - in the '80'
This was the best stocking stuffer ever. And we got 4. One for each of us. Mine is know at my office, and my boss loves it
I want to believe all of the positive reviews; I really do!  But at the moment I'm still having problems with the downloading and uploading of the firmware.  I know, I know:  do it in recovery mode!  Whatever that is!  (Don't worry, I've been to the site and followed the directions 20+ times!) ---  --- And as for customer support...I got a message giving hours and "Good bye" ( I did called during the hours CS was supposedly open).  I had a MPIO and wanted something more reliable but once again find the software package and manual (so big and so little information!) are not intuitive or easy to use.  Maybe the Mac Nation is right. ---  --- And as for that first review posted here on Amazon.com, I hope that guy got a bonus; he must be working for Cowan! ---  --- Don
Chris Joss delivers some serious blaxploitation inspired grooves that will wisk you back to the times of bell bottoms, afros and platform shoes!  Joss' "You've Been Spiked" is a retrospective piece of marvellously produced tracks that pays true homage to an era that gave us some of the funkiest music ever!  In fact, this music sounds so authentic you would think they came straight out of the 70's...but it's all circa the 21st century.  It's good to know that there are still modern cats (especially on the ESL Record label)who know how to recapture music from days gone by.    
As I went through music school in the eary fifties I was confronted with "Lenny". Now at 72 I still have this pleasure. There are people in the NYP that are legendary as are the performances. This set will give me a huge amount of pleasure for what ever time I have left. It is a wonderful historical document but most of all a tribute-legacy that people will be wondering about many years in the future. Bob Allshouse from the Dana school of Music 1952-57 
WHAT TO DO IF YOU JUST BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT: Go outside and bang your head as hard as you can against the side of your house---Maybe that will knock some sense into you after you've gone looney trying to use this piece of junk!!! As many reviewers have noted, it is extremely difficult to get this bottle warmer to work properly. --- First off, the little vials you use to measure the water into are poorly marked -- Why did they choose to use teeny-tiny WHITE lettering? STUPID! It is then very tricky to get the proper amount of water into the vials. In fact the difference between say, level 2 and level 3 is maybe two drops of water! Trying doing that out of a standard faucet. In fact we use a filtered water faucet (with a thin spout) and it is still hard to get write. --- But that's easy compared to figuring out the right water-in-the-vial to formula-in-the bottle ratio! We are currently using a 4oz Playtex bottle (with the disposable bags) and are contantly playing a guessing game as to the right amount of water to use. Level 3--- still to cold, but wait, last night that same amount of water practically scalded the formula! And just try to use a vented-type bottle...Forget it! How about an 8oz. bottle? NO WAY! Either way to cold or way to hot. --- And even though we use filtered water, this thing still need to be cleaned with vinegar (as recommended) evey week or so. However, the cleaning barely hepls and after less than 8 weeks of use we now use the microwave more and more. Why? Because we know that 4oz. of formula will always need 6-7 seconds in the microwave...Every time
I said I was going to be honest in all reviews, and yes, I kinda clunkered on this one.  I hate this CD.  Simply put.  They can't sing, and the songs are boring. ---  --- I'm sorry I bought this CD, and other people might not like me saying that, but it's my opinion.  I listen to power metal extensively and there is MUCH better stuff out there like Symphony X, Nightwish or Sonata Artica. ---  --- Don't buy this, though, you might like it.  I'd definitely listen to it first
Just look at some of the virtues touted by the producers of California Red Seedless Grapes, 1 lbs: ---  --- --Great For Eating With Cheese  --- --Great For Fruit Salad And Also Makes A Great Snack For Kids  --- --"High in Vitamin A, C & Calcium"  ---  --- You can't help sitting back and staring in awe at California Red Seedless Grapes, 1 lbs for it's utility and virtues.  On top of all that, they're SEEDLESS!!!!  Praised by greek philosophers for their healing powers, grapes are loved universally by both Democrats and Republicans...yes, a bipartisan fruit needed so badly in a time of partisan divisiveness, congressional sex scandals and unpopular wars.  Grapes bridge the divide between states, both red and blue.  No one can deny the power and tastiness of California Red Seedless Grapes, 1 lbs
The article that receipt is difrente to that of the photo that appears. The conector to the camera is not USB/Fire Wire, but it is a type nini Stereo
This was not the entire version of the HBO Special.  I was disappointed because some of my favorite parts were missing from this DVD.  If I had known it wasn't the entire show I wouldn't have bought it
Because the ideas and strategies really work! Robert Allen gives more concrete information, real meat if you will in one chapter than these other so called financial authors do in an entire book. ---  --- I used the ideas from Robert Allen to buy my first home, nothing down 5 years ago and the value of my home has escalated BUT...the return on my investment on a nothing down deal is infinite!  ---  --- Hey...if you don't like Robert Allen, you can always read Jane Bryant Quinn and lose money with her advice. I was talking to a guy the other day in a book store who said he lost over 75% of his 401 (k) money following Quinn's "safe" advice. ---  --- OR...you can read those tabloid websites which are around only to attract the naive and also are out to sell you their generic junk most of which is plagerized Robert Allen ideas
I had one of these when they first came out and loved it.  This one is even better.  I would say it's a must have for someone that has trouble getting a steak medium rare.  Since purchasing this item, I once again have the perfect steak.  I am so glad I found this fork again.  I am one happy person
We actually went through two of these in two weeks. The first one cooked the bottom 20+ wipes, so we returned it thinking that it was simply defective. The second one did the exact same thing! We wasted so many wipes with this warmer, since they were "cooked". We have even emailed the company and sent them pictures, but never heard back from them. Save your money
The canopy bar broke only two days after Christmas.   --- Now I have a sharp end on the bed frame.  Not good --- for little fingers.  For the price, I thought it would --- have been a lot more sturdy
this is an alright camera. if you're an average teen looking to post some hot pictures on myspace, or just someone looking to capture a few choice family moments, this camera should serve you fine. ---  --- what i liked about it: --- 1. it's compact, lightweight and easy enough to use --- 2. pictures taken in daylight turn out pretty nice --- 3. the battery life on this camera is much better than on other cameras i've used ---  --- what i disliked about it: --- 1. it's a bit flimsy to be honest --- 2. attempting to take a picture in the afternoon, evening or early morning is near impossible without it looking completely washed out or too dark. even though it has a night landscape option, it doesn't really work. --- 3. the flash causes a horrible delay (but that's been mentioned like 9,000 times before) ---  --- this is definitely not a camera for glamour shots. i'd also strongly discourage buying it if you're thinking of using it to take pictures at music events
I have been a subscriber to Threads since it's inaugural issue, and have saved every one. The publishers, writers and editors have uncompromising standards for accuracy, originality and inspiration. While the magazine has evolved over the years, and away from accessory crafts such as knitting, it has nevertheless remained the premier publication for fine sewing. Some articles are geared towards the advanced sewers, but many basic techniques and information are shown and explained more clearly, in more easy to understand depth, than any other publication of it's type. The pictures and diagrams are professional and clear. The instructions well written. Even the advertising is worth perusing. Top caliber all around
This is a great DVD.  I bought it for my son, who has Special Needs.  He attends a lot of dances and is always on the dance floor, but has never been able to figure out how to do the Electric Slide or Macarena.  Neither my husband nor I knew how to do these dances either.  I played the "Party Line Dances" DVD, and asked my son to follow Shawn's instructions.  Pretty soon he was moving along with Shawn, and doing very well.  And by joining a few of our son's practices, my husband and I quickly picked up the dance moves too.  My son now participates fully, and we look forward to line dancing at our own occasions
My son is tiny- born at 5lbs 6oz and very much a preemie. I simply cannot imagine putting him in the infant seat without this. It keeps his entire body in place- not just his head. It provides great support and the soft white fuzzy side is very warm (we havnt used the other side yet.)  ---  --- My only complaint is its a bit akward to get the shoulder straps in the correct place around baby- but thats mostly because our baby is still very tiny. once he;s bigger and we can move the headpiece up it shouldnt be a problem
i bought the grados thinking i was going to experience heavenly sound, but that was not the case. I was pretty disappointed when i first heard them because to me, it wasnt much different sounding than my sennheiser hd202s and panasonic earphones. (note: i am not an audiophile and am just an "average joe" in terms of deciphering sound) But after a week or so, i am starting to appreciate them. They are much more comfortable than my hd202s (i wear glasses and the hd202s hurt my ears so much) and definitely sound better. But, if u ask me if they sound $69 dollars better than my hd202s, i would say NO! I am still trying to search for that "heavenly" sound or mind blowing experience from headphones so if anyone has any recommendations, please post them in your revie
As a subscriber to Martha Stewarts magazines I have to admit this has become my favorite, simply because its concise and interesting to boot.  Love the Week End dinner section, as well as the Recipe Index at the front of the magazine which is helpful when I am looking for something quick to consider fixing, but do not have the time or desire to sit down and read the whole magazine.  ---  --- Some of the other regular features that I like and find helpful are the Cooking for One section, since as a widow I hate wasting food and know of many other singles who want to eat healthy but need some ideas.  Also like the Wine Basics section which has enlightened me on new wines that I now like trying.  In Season is a great section because it reminds the reader what is in season, which makes shopping and cooking easier.  ---  --- The size of the magazine is nice because it slips easily into my pocket so I can recheck it while shopping to see what items I have highlighted to pick up.  This is also a great magazine for couples, singles of all ages, which is refreshing since so many magazines are geared to upper middle class, 2.5 children homes.  And... the magazine seems to improve with each new issue
Be cautioned when ordering this product. ---  --- What happened was I ordered this product a month ago, and was sent the flatbread version instead of the clear tub of bite-size version.  I called Amazon, explained my problem, they promised to fix it by sending me a replacement. ---  --- Well, the replacement came last week, and it was still the flatbread.  I'm not going to bother to call Amazon again because I know it will just result in them sending me the flatbread once again. ---  --- The flatbread itself was tasty and crunchy.  I think the seeds really helped to put more complexity into the flavor.  You can eat just the flatbread as snacks or maybe put a bit peanut butter or jam on top.  It tastes very different than wheat, and I like the taste of spelt quite a bit. ---  --- So please be prepared to receive the flatbread version when you order.  You may as well just order the flatbread version to start with and save yourself couple of bucks as well as having to call Amazon to straighten things out
I love the 5 point harness.  My daughter needed to get out of the car seat but still need more than a seat belt.  This seat was easy to install and we love it
It always seems like a holiday when my UTNE arrives.  It has never failed to delight me in my long tenure as a subscriber and fan.   ---  --- Nowadays, with so much of our "news" actually being political spin and hype, with that forced-fed feeling, it is so refreshing to be able to read interesting, tasty, thoroughly satisfying stuff that is not the run-of-the mill, banal, overly celebrity-focused junk. [Hey, I like celebrities just as much as the next guy, but I like to take a break once-in-a-while.]  UTNE respects your intelligence. It seems to arrive just on time, every time. ---  --- The focus here is on improving one's life and, perhaps, one's corner of the world (or just a corner of a room).  Sure, there is a progressive bent to the content (it used to be dubbed "the best of the alternative media"): there's ample pro-environment, pro-organic, pro-diversity, pro-spirituality content here. [Have they made "progressive" a dirty word, too???] I find it consistently conducive to recharging my batteries. ---  --- GO FOR IT.  YOU WILL BE AMPLY REWARDED.  Like entering a fresh, new world every two months.  You will likely read it from cover-to-cover
I have bought 2 seasons of Survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete. Very dissapointing. Guatemala  episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show. Just leaves you hanging. Exile Island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between Danielle and Cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show
I loved "The Incredibles," so I was excited to play the game.  I've only been playing video games the last couple years, and only off and on, so I'm really just a beginner.  Perhaps that explains the enormous difficulty I've had with this game.  My boyfriend is a long-time video game player, and he was able to do things in one or two tries that I labored for hours over.  Even using cheat codes did not really help me all that much.  I was surprised when I read the review that said the game was too easy.  I almost cried.  LOL  But seriously, unless you are a good gamer, you're probably going to be more frustrated than challenged by this game.  As for me, I guess I'll stick to action RPGs
I bougt this camera and a Olymus camera, both in the same price range, the Kodak camera was by far deficeint in quality of image and workmanship. Avoid this at all cost the Olympus was well made, durable, higher quality picture and ease of use
My first two black 15 cartridges worked pretty well in my HP Deskjet 3820 then the third one started to indicate low fluid level and stopped printing. I replaced it with a new cartridges but it refused to work at all. While repeatingly trying to reinstall it as tech support suggested, the etch tore. When examing the inside of the printer, I found that black ink had splattered around inside the mechanism area indicating a leakage.  The next new cartridge would not work either. $$ wasted.  Tech support said to have the printer repaired -- ya sure (after only one year of moderate home use and the warantee had ran out). Printer repair would cost me more a new one
Don't get me wrong...I'm as likely as anyone else looking for a "chick flick" to watch the latest Meg Ryan movie with the cute leading man....but this movie adds something extra. Instead of just dishing out the same old blather that most romantic comedies spout (girl & guy meet, girl & guy go through some conflict, but eventually guy & girl get together and live happily ever after) this movie actually takes the time to explore what makes a relationship between two people special and unique, whether that relationship is between two friends, lovers, or family members.  ---  --- This movie is also great because it expounds upon the HUGE role that a person's mind plays when it comes to love and sex.  ---  --- Kate Capshaw's character, Helen, is great for audience members who still haven't figured out that women are sexual beings and that it's OKAY for them to enjoy sex! (Even with a much younger man!)  ---  --- All the characters remind us that even though we may not have everything figured out, you can always learn some new tricks, no matter what your age. ---  --- If you're in the mood for mindless entertainment, I wouldn't recommend this movie. However, if you're ready for a touching and romantic but still lighthearted flick, this is a good one!
So far this is the best thickening mascara I have tried that are either sold in drug stores or at department stores. It is not sticky or gloppy and you won't look like Tammy Fay with spider lashes. I do however, have to apply two coats to bring out the more sparse areas of my lashes, but I have finally stopped my search for thickening mascaras. My journey ends here
The product works well for my space and needs. One note to Amaazon. When you ship a $400 item, thats semi fragile, and the box shows up looking like it was used as a make shift soccer ball, how does the consumer deal with physical damage? The item is so massive to ship back, and most likey costly. --- I experimented with buying an expensive electronic online because the price was right. I was worried how the shipping would be handled, and sure enough, I was worried rightfully. The DVD tray catches everytime the tray comes in and goes out. The top of the receiver/dvd player had been slightly caved in. Even with all the packing Samsung supplied, it could not protect the product from the shipping company. It will be such a hassle to try and exchange this, that I am not sure if I will be purchasing something this expensive and fragile online again. Other than that, I have purchased smaller items, and less fragile from Amazon with no issues. I realize that the shipping damage canot be held on Amazon, as it is out of their control. I just don't think I will roll the dice on something like this in the future. Too bad, it would have been nice to say good buy to brick and mortar pressure salesmen
I only ordered this because my child was begging for the swimming mermaid. I compared Amazon's listing with the manufacture listing and ordered. We did not get what we ordered... we got a barbie dressed in a mermaid costume, NOT the swimming one! This was from Santa and, I'm sorry, but seeing that type of disappointment in a six year old's eyes just breaks your heart. Of course, it was after the packaging was torn apart to get her out and into eager hands. For the first time in my years of shopping, I feel robbed

I've owned this smoker for 6 years and have had great success turning out turkeys, pulled pork, ribs, etc. ---  --- Couple of tips that took me some time to work out. ---  --- 1) Cover the water pan with some heavy duty foil after filling it. This'll prevent the liquid from boiling away too quickly. You won't have to refill it during the smoking, and it'll prevent the smoker from getting too "wet" inside. When I left it uncovered, I was getting steamed meat, not smoked. ---  --- 2) Drill a hole in the bottom of the unit, and get a drip pan underneath it. This'll allow any condensation to drip out rather than collecting in the bottom of the smoker and promoting rust. ---  --- 3) Get some heavy duty foil beneath the heater element. Makes cleanup much easier, and gets the heat reflected up to the food. ---  --- Have fun...
Just as my title states- this item was purchased as a gift.  My friend loves the pendant, but upon arrival it had a small scratch on the body of the horse
This litle gadget has come in handy on a number of occasions.  It's collapsable, strong, light and easy to use.  I wish the price was under $[...], but the best price I could find was on Amazon.com and it's what my wife wanted and loves.  We also bought one each of these for our grown children and they use them constantly.  A GOOD PRODUCT!!
Don't buy this stroller. The only good thing about it is that you won't be sad if you leave it somewhere. The "restraints" don't restrain at all. My one year old twins barely stay in it so when we're in a store they can reach very far to pull down all sorts of things. (not safe) The stroller barely fits through regular door ways - and I mean barely fits. It does not maneuver well at all and is difficult to stear. The "adult drink cup holder" snaps off when struggling to go through doors and I don't have to describe what a mess that is. I'm just lucky I don't drink hot coffee; otherwise I would be suing the manufacturer for burns to the children. There is no storage. The "saddle bags" can hold a few small things but you should only use it for things you don't mind the children being able to reach. This stroller is not only a nuisance, it has potentially dangerous features, so please don't buy it
The best Cleopatra that the movies has ever produced.Be it in the scenario as well as the performance of an actress in the part. --- So many came before and so many after Elizabeth Taylor however to me Cleopatra will always be Elizabeth Taylor. --- A mega movie, with fantastic costumes, and acting, is a classic in historic movies.If you are history lover you should have this movie in your collection
however it only a six day cooler if it rarely opened but it a great 3 day cooler in hot weather for normal opening to get drinks out of  --- thant that is very impressive as most coolers can go more then a day or two when there opened frequently
From the beginning of Ruby's story, through all the footnotes of life, to the burying of Bunty...we live four generations of the Lennox family.  This is not your average family, people disappear, mothers leave families, children die in mysterious ways.   ---  --- For me the best of all the little stories, is Ruby getting ready to be born. Atkinsons description of being literally in the womb is priceless.   ---  --- Two themes seem to pervade this book...poor marriages to drunks and pregnancy out of wedlock.  In the end, Ruby learns the greatest lesson of all the women in this book...you can't run away from yourself. 
 i had heard of cannibal ferox for quite some time before watching it. i heard that it was the most violent film ever made. i enjoyed umberto lenzis eaten alive and thought this would be even better. i was dead wrong. cannibal ferox is a boring, unpleasent film that definatly doesnt live up to its infamous reputation. im not saying that cannibal ferox isnt gory or violent but i cant see how it was ever banned in 31 countrys. the few gore scenes are pretty effective, but that dosnt make up for the films many many flaws. if it was for giovanni lombardo radice[one of my favorite italian horror actors] starring in it, cannibal ferox would only earn 1 star.
I don't speak a word of french,and I barely read it, but I love this magazine!!! If you love fashion, get a french dictionary,I did, this is a magazine to savor! I have every issue since Ms. Roitfeld took over and will keep them forever! This magazine is very sexy, modern, french, well edited, up to the minute, bold, well designed(Fabian Baron) intelligent, I could go on and on, I've seen/get all the rest, including Vogue Italia, this edition has all the best stylists, photogs, and editors, I can't wait for the next issue!
I was amazed on how well this battery has performed. I did make sure when I got it I did a complete charge and complete discharge and it has not let me down since. I can shoot well over two hours without needing to change to the very meek battery that came with my camcorder (Sony HDR-HC1). It is thicker and sticks off the back a little bit more so you can not get your eye up to the eyepiece but I use the LCD when shooting anyway, and almost always on tripod
i dont know what can i write . i want anything about art exactly about painting,drawing,modern ar
I think the most striking part of this book is that you feel comforted by the fact that the problems you're facing in your own relationships are commonplace. They're not dysfunctional. Every family has its share of issues and you don't need to feel overly guilty for yours. The book's underlying theme is that families that honesty, consideration, character, belief and perhaps above everything else - resilience, can get you through the worst debacles and that at the end of the day it's probably (though not always) worth the effort. ---  --- Stories include: --- Resentment about controlling parents who appear to display conditional loving and also about appreciating how much of their lives parents sacrifice to bring the kids up; the search for redemption after abandoning a kid or cheating on a wife, the courage required to break relationships that are dead and the perseverance required to bring one back from the dead (and the effect on kids), dealing with the families of your in-laws and family objection to marriage, how to deal with kids who are falling into bad habits when you feel powerless to influence their decisions because they no longer respect you or listen to you, dealing with the death of a child, how we feel obligated to spend time with our families rather than actually wanting to spend time with them and what we are losing, etc. ---  --- Although it may seem that most people cannot relate to these situations... actually I felt an amazing amount of empathy for the families and came away with a renewed conviction that I can get the perfect family life (with all it's frustrations and headaches) and balance it with everything. ---  --- If you have any relationship, friendship that you have a certain amount of frustration, resignation about then I strongly recommend this book. It is one of those books that if it hits you at the right time - it could change your relationships and your life
Not worth the buy. Very hard to use in the pool. Vendor delivery service was great
I expected much better quality from Thule. As used according to the manufacturers recomendations, this bag did not even last one trip from New York to Chicago without it's interior lining cracking and completely flaking off. In addition, the back of the bag ripped creating two large holes in the fabric and the zipper attachments became loose and proceeded to pound at the roof of my car. The contents shifted continually during travel making for a loud noise that's not unlike a pouring rain hitting the top of the car. This becomes a terrible distraction while driving. All in all I had a very bad experience with this product and would not reccomend it. Opt for one of the solid constuction type carriers, they cost much more, but are worth every penny. In the end I thought I was saving money with this product but wound up having to purchase a Sears X-Cargo container to replace it for my return trip back.
I am new to this type of device, but it has performed as expected
I discarded the DVD after watching it. If you do not want to have the impression of witchcraft in your home don't buy this version of The Secret Garden.

This is a great bra for any mother that is looking for a nursing bra!  I live in the US and had a terrible time finding this bra in any store or anywhere on line.  It's a fabulous bra. It's very comfortable, washed up nicely and provides great support.  This is our second child and I wish I had these with the first
There were too many characters, disjointed plot threads, not much of a plot in the first place, and not much coverage of the overall march itself.  It focused on many obscure and unimportant characters who weren't that compelling
This is the best of the best.  Hands down this is one of the best broadway concerts you will EVER see.  Colm Wilkinson, Lea Salonga, Michael Ball are all amazing.  Fabulous talent, great singing
John Mayer can grow his hair long and play his guitar slung low, but he is still a professionaly trained monkey, I mean musician. Mayer along with "artists" like Gavin DeGraw, Teddy Geiger, etc., are todays N'Sync and Backstreet Boys, nothing more. 
fits the cell phone well and seems secure. i like the catch that holds it on the belt to keep it from slipping off the belt when sitting dow
I am very disappointed in this CD.  Not because the music isn't good, because it is.  But because it is just not the Pat Green that used to play in Stillwater.  The passionate, soulful Pat Green.  Back then he sang about things that he believed in and loved.  Now he is singing what Nashville tells him to.  And this coming from the guy who sang "Nashville Sucks" with Cory Morrow.  There are a ton of country singers out there that could have released this CD and it would have sounded exactly the same.  But songs like "Southbound 35" and "Three Day" can only be sang by Pat Green.  He needs to revisit his roots and come back to the red dirt country music that he was born to play.  Will the real Pat Green please stand up
I'm not an expert on footballs, but I haven't seen anything wrong with the way this one is performing.  It's easy to grip and throw, and it doesn't have that cheesy "hey I'm a recreational football" look to it.  Good deal for the money
Yes the game has been missing the constant songs about drugs, girls, cars and jewelery. I tell you Juelz really came with an original formula with this album. The stuff he mentions on this one has never been said before and Juelz is an innovator as well as the rest of the dipset. LOL!!!! These guys listen to other peoples albums and just reiterate the same stuff in a different song and beat. Save your money
If this had been the first album in the "Hip-Hop Hits" series, it would not be a promising start. There are a few decent tunes on here, but as someone who admired the quality of the earlier Source albums, I must express an intense dislike for "Hip Hop Hits Vol.8". There used to be a time when The Source gathered the biggest AND best tracks from the rap indusrty for their compilations, now Benzino has turned the series into a shameless promotion for his own favorites (How else do you explain Ja Rule being here?). Here is a song-by-song analysis of this disaster: --- (1) YoungBloodz feat. Lil Jon  "Damn" C-. This song is perfect example of why people are getting bored with "Sothern Crunk". It's lame and boring, as it shows Lil Jon becoming a one-trick pony. Not a good song to open an album with.        --- (2) Wyclef "The Industry" B. Wyclef is very talented,but this song was never a hit. It should be heard for its quality though, even if it only touchs topics breifly. It is clear that Wyclef is above most of his peers in everyway; sorta like 2Pac.   --- (3) Chingy "Right Thurr" B+. Not my favorite rap song,its better than average though, it kinda grows on you. He reminds me of Juvenile. It's content is not original, but Chingy makes it his own with a relaxed flow and style.  --- (4) Young Gunz "Can't Stop, Won't Stop" C. If this standard work is what Roca-A-Fella has in it's post-Jay-Z future,the label is going to be in real trouble. They're good, but they have to be better than good to stand on their own.   --- (5) Westside Connection feat. Nate Dogg "Gangsta Nation" B+. It was nice to see Westside together again. The style and talent cover up for the somewhat standard material. At the bare minimum, the song is stylistic and very enjoyable.     --- (6) Ja-Rule "Clap Back" D. This anti-Eminem dis is just border line pathetic and lame. Any Eminem song is a bigger hit and better than Ja Rule's weak new stuff. If Ja Rule wants to return to his position "Pain Is Love" brought him to, he must work much harder.      --- (7) Kanye West "Through The Wire" C. Kanye West has enjoyed chart success through alot of hype, but I find this song to be very pedestrian for rap. The lyrics don't define Kanye as an original rapper, and the use Chaka Kahn's "Through The Fire" doesn't make a very appealing beat.    --- (8) Gang Starr "Skills" C. The group isn't that good to begin with, and this song has none of the fun that "Militia" had. Gang Starr has a decent, hardcore sound that needs to be refined in order to define themselves. --- (9) J-Kwon "Tipsy" B-.This song is fun to listen to, but that still does not make it any better than average. It's not really about anything and gets kinda tiresome towards the end; you may be looking at your watch. He's too overpraised.        --- (10) E-40 feat. Clipse "Quarterbackin" C+. The track is enjoyable but was never that popular and is pretty forgetable. E-40 and Clipse just aren't that talented. It almost feels as if it was made strictly for the "Madden Football" video games". --- (11) Fabolous feat. Tamia "Into You" A. Just great, hip hop with style and substance. It's so nice to hear a gentler, more positive hip-hop songs; one that doesn't hammer the listener, but brings out emotions lightly. He is one of the best rappers of 2003; with both his album and it's singles. --- (12) T.I. "Be Easy" C-. He has been compared to Jay-Z and Nelly; despite the difference that he lacks the talent those artists have. Plain, boring, generic rap from an artist who ofers nothing new to the game; no more needs to be said. One must also wonder why this was chosen over his bigger (not exactly better though) hits "Rubber Band Man" and "Let's Get Away".        --- (13) Cassidy feat. R. Kelly "Hotel" B-. A sorta fun track, R. Kelly does as much as possible, but he even he can't make Cassidy sound original. To be honest, this was a huge Top 10 hit though; so it kinda does belong here.  --- (14) Ying Yang Twins feat. Lil' Jon & the East Side Boyz "Salt Shaker" B+. Surprisingly, the beat and production make this song rather entertaining. It's much more fun than it has the right to be; given the non-spectacular artists involved. --- (15) Scarface "Recognize" C-. Scarface used to be an exceptional rapper, but now he's trying to regain glory that is no longer his. Why listen to this, when you could just buy his older albums?       --- (16) The Untouchables featuring Benzino "Relationship With Me & My Gun" C-.Just a standard Benzino track tacked on for shameless self-promotion. I wouldn't mind so much if the songt had actually been worth listening to. Atleast "Bang Ta Dis" on "Vol.5" was a good song.  --- Bottom Line: *1/2. Benzino has ruined the once great Source series in the blink of an eye. If you want to hear a great Source album, buy "Hip Hop Hits Vol.4"; a Source album with the BIGGEST AND BEST raps of 2000. A few good tracks are not enough to balance out all the mediocre ones. To put it in short terms: with so many good compilations out there, why spend money on a bad one? I would not buy this album with a gift card.  
I love the shoes, they're quite comfortable even though the heel is a little higher than what I like. They're a beautiful color, something you don't always see, and quite eye-catching.  And they just so happened to go very well with a suit I purchased months ago.   ---  --- As a "Nine West" Fantatic, thank you Amazon for having them available! --- 
This is a good product if you like your tires to look new but not too shiney. It could last longer and attract less dirt though. Amazon shipped it pretty quickly considering it was for free
this shampoo made my dandruff even worse.  after using it, it did make my scalp feel cool and cleansed, but an hour later i combed my hair and there were huge flakes in it.  if you have to pay a little more for a dandruff shampoo buy paul mitchell's tea tree shampoo or something. 
I searched for new seatcovers only to find Hawaiian flower prints in almost all automtive stores. Then I found Amy Brown Moonsprite seatcovers. These were reasonably priced and were not some flower print. There's more to these, they have a soft feel to them like velour. My last set were nylon and some days would develop static and shock me every time I exited the car. The other thing is  --- there are other products like floor mats that have the same moonsprite logo
I am very surprised how well this case fit my Razr V3M. It fits very well and looks very nice.

Other reviews have homed in on the frequent nit-picking and general vindictiveness of this book.  I agree with these criticisms, but I'm not going to revisit them here.  The deeper problem lies with the Ayn Rand Institute, which only gives scholarly access to persons guaranteed to toe ARI's party line.  As long as the Ayn Rand Institute refuses full, unconditional scholarly access to Miss Rand's papers, any biographical efforts produced under their aegis will not be taken seriously by anyone who respects proper academic practice.  Nor should they be.

i have a huge head but these headphones are not a problem.  the metal band easily deforms to accomodate a dome such as mine.  the sound quality is ridiculously good.  they are very easily powered as well.  they sound loud and clear through my toshiba gigabeat which doesnt get quite as loud as an ipod (because of their efficiency they are actually louder than the 8 ohm impedence earbuds that came with the gigabeat).   ---  --- my head is a little sensitive so i am looking into some replacement ear cushions or some way to mod the ones i have.  these phones do leak a lot of sound though.  i wouldnt feel right using them on a plane or in a library or anything because they are very open.  you might want something semi-open or closed if youre doing travelling since they let in plenty of sound as well.  overall fantastic headphones, worth every dollar
As a peripheral BNL fan, I have always admired the off beat sense of humor these guys dish out.  With previous releases, I have been able to discover new things in repeated listenings.  This cd got stale fast.  Seems to be geared to the tween crowd.  I am hopeful newer releases will stay true to the BNL I have enjoyed in years past
I heard how good the Haribo brand was and decided to give it a try.  Amazon was out of stock of the regular gummi bears, and I didn't want to wait so these looked like the next best thing.  Now I am hooked and plan on buying more when my 5 lb bag runs out
I love this clock because it has it all in a slick package for a good price.  The battery lasts forever, so it's portable, the time sets itself atomically, it shows the temperature, has the obligatory annoying alarm clock, the time lights up on the ceiling, and it looks good to boot.  Very well-made and highly recommended.  Oregon Scientific rocks
These are great, the whole family loves them and they have 5 mg fiber per package. Really tasty, nice and crunchy. I have several boxes of them in the car for when the little ones need a little something when we are on the go. Other snack ideas include those little raisin boxes (but then raisins get everywhere) and packages of dried fruit (which seem to work pretty well since they are not as sticky as raisins). These All-Bran snack bites really go over well and they are much healthier than candy.  ---  --- I sure wish Amazon would sell these online
I will only use Krusell products as they are better than Best. Customer Service is as good as the product. There is no finer quality and the selection of products is well above the rest. Krusell products cost a little more but quality and durability far surpass the price. The rating should be a 10
I do a pretty good bit of video production. I have used let's say most of them in the quest of finding a video editor that would do the real things I need. Ulead Video Studio 10 Plus is pretty good, but it lacks in the audio section. Pinnacle: not worth the bucks I paid for it at Best Buy. Magix: nice but seriously lacking the depth needed in the audio section. --- I had used Premiere Pro before and liked a lot of the features provided in it but the price, my god, was just too much. I found Premiere Elements on Amazon and hoped that it would do the job. It did. --- Elements 3 has almost and I say almost features as does Premiere Pro. Some features have been streamlined for the amateur but learning to use Elements has been fun and productive.  --- I would recommend Adobe Premiere Elements 3 to any intermediate to advanced video editing person
I once read an article in Horn Book Magazine (a review source of titles and articles on children's literature) that lamented the millions of poor translations of Hans Christian Andersen polluting the minds of our young people today.  The review mentioned that stories like, "The Snow Queen", which were originally written in a snappy vernacular, have been dumbed down and drained of all energy by their American translators.  With this idea fresh in my mind I found myself in possession of a very particular copy of "The Snow Queen" and I was able to test this theory myself.  Now due to the wacky nature of Amazon.com, the website has lumped together the reviews of every single version of this Anderson story.  You will see that some of the reviews refer to Nilesh Mistry's, some refer to the audio book, some to Eileen Kernaghan's, and some (God help us all) to Mary Engelbreit.  None of these, however, are the version that I am reviewing.  After careful consideration, I selected the edition retold by Amy Ehrlich and illustrated by Susan Jeffers.  The Ehrlich/Jeffers team has banded together to bring us every fairy tale from Thumbelina to Cinderella.  With this 1982 classic edition, they bring all the creepy and crawly elements of Andersen's riveting tale to a kind of tame middlebrow life. ---   --- Most people don't remember that "The Snow Queen" begins when the devil creates a mirror that reflects everything good as bad.  By a quirk of fate the mirror is smashed one day (the details of this accident are left unclear) and the tiny pieces go spinning into the atmosphere.  If these splinters enter your eye, everything will look ugly to you.  If they enter your heart, it will turn instantly to ice.  Got it?  Good.  Cause sure enough, two small pieces enter the eye and the heart of a boy named Kai.  When this happens he stops playing with his best playmate Gerta and instead falls under the seductive spell of the mysterious and magnificently pale Snow Queen.  Gerta goes in search of her friend but is waylaid by a variety of different adventures.  She escapes an overly loving old witch, is taken in by a prince and princess, falls into the power of a thief girl and her kin, and at last saves Kai from the Snow Queen herself.  By the end of the book, neither kid is a child any longer and their home is just as they left it. ---   --- Obviously "The Snow Queen" is one big ole story about growing up.  The idea of the devil's mirror causing someone to despise anything they see and grow a suddenly cold heart... well that's just another way of describing adolescence, is it not?  Andersen obviously borrowed quite a lot from that classic old tale, "East of the Sun, West of the Moon", in which another girl goes off to save the man she loves from the machinations of a wicked woman.  Heck, "Tam Lin" was probably an influence as well.  The best version of this particular story I ever read was by Kara Dalkey.  It was a tale named, "The Lady of the Ice Garden" and can be found in "Firebirds: An Anthology of Original Science Fiction and Fantasy".  It is not, however, appropriate for children.  Kids today will probably look at "The Snow Queen" and instantly think of the White Witch from "The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe".  I cannot think, however, that this is a bad thing.   ---   --- As for the Jeffers/Ehrlich version, it's all right.  As an illustrator, Jeffers has apparently decided to make Kai and Gerta definitely children.  I guess that lowers the creepiness factor when the Snow Queen lures the boy to her sleigh and wraps him in her furs.  Jeffers really captures beautifully every diamond in the Snow Queen's dress and every strand of her white white hair.  There is the odd stylistic choice here and there, though.  When Gerta surprises the prince and princess in their bed, it is not your typical mattress affair but rather large his and her flower petals.  I can't think that they're comfortable (or even particularly practical).  The illustrations have been created, according to the book, "using a fine-line pen with ink and dyes.  They were applied over a detailed pencil drawing that was then erased".  As a result, the book is as soft as a colored pencil, but with a level of detail and intricacy normally associated with pen and ink. ---   --- Obviously I don't know enough about the original version of "The Snow Queen" (or, as Andersen called it, "Sneedronningen") to know whether or not this book is a worthy version to read to your tots.  At any rate, it tells the full story, warts and all, and will provide them with what may well be the most Freudian-toned fairy tale ever to grace their little brains.  A fun edition of a rather odd tale
Not much else o say, they look and wear awesome. The price is very good as well.  recommend these for anyone with pierced ears
These earrings are very pretty. They are a nice size and they aren't heavy at all, very lightweight. I have had them for a week or so now and have gotten nothing but compliments on them. They are great and so is the price! The vendor sent them very promptly and there were no problems.
'Introducing Postmodernism' is a good source to gather names of philosophers, architects, artists, anthropologists, linguists, and everyone in between that have been somehow connected to PM. The problem, and it is a big one, is that this style of tour de force writing does little to contextualize all these diverse disciplines. Sure, if you only have half an hour to read up on PM, you can whip through this book and go on with your life. But if you're wanting to really absorb the phenomenon, and perhaps go on to read more, this book is NOT the place to start. Check out David Harvey's 'Condition of Postmodernism.' This will rip the top of your head clean off! It's much more weighty (in every sense of the word), but your understanding of PM will vastly improve, and will better prepare you to go on to other important writers of the 'genre'
Wow, this book should be given to every graduate entering the workforce along with their diploma. Not just about cards, but also contains business etiquette, marketing tips and techniques, and (un)common sense. Wish I had read it 20 years ago. Required reading for pretty much anybody who has to go out into the world and deal with another person
Along with reception of new HD stations I expected high quality FM & AM to go with my complete top line stereo system. Instead, the HDT-1 gives me very poor quality, even less than a table-top clock radio. Very high output - can only turn amp up to lowest level - and painful to listen to. No response to inquiries from Sangean.

I received my Stamina Products Adjustable Hyperextension Bench on March 13th of '07 and was very disappointed. There was hardly any insulation whatsoever in the box and it looked like it was just thrown in the box. The product was scratched and parts were broken.  ---  --- Fortunately the bench works, but it looks like it is already a few years old with all the damage. The product seems to be of quality, it's just unfortunate that SPS doesn't understand how important that packaging is and if it is insufficient it makes the product look cheap

I wanted to like BROTHERHOOD, for the simple reason that nearly every New Order fan this side of the galaxy has dismissed it, usually with a faint whiff of snobbery (or at least apathy). Turns out they were right: BROTHERHOOD is half an album. Most of its nine songs feel unfinished, as if the band wanted to cash in on the success of their 1985 smash LOW-LIFE and didn't care about the end result. BROTHERHOOD is a rush job, plain and simple, but there are still glimmers of hope within this bare-bones effort.  ---  --- "As It Is When It Was" overcomes the album's overall muddy production by dint of being mostly acoustic, and the melody is quite lovely. "All Day Long", the emotional centerpiece of the album by default, is an intelligent (if half-hearted) protest against child abuse. While "Angel Dust" lacks a decent hook, its subtly danceable beat and effective synth noodlings will at least briefly hold your interest. And the toss-off "Every Little Counts" has a charming sense of humor that is too often lacking in New Order's work. ---  --- The most popular song on BROTHERHOOD is, of course, "Bizarre Love Triangle". So good it seems to belong to a different album entirely, "Bizarre Love Triangle" is truly New Order's masterpiece. The solid beat, slick sequencer work, and gorgeous melody showcase the band at their best: catchy, danceable, and downright euphoric. (Imagine how well it would have fit on LOW-LIFE.) ---  --- Sadly, the rest of BROTHERHOOD is unremarkable. The album's production neatly mixes rock with electronic flourishes, which has become New Order's signature sound, but the songwriting doesn't measure up. Buy the album if you're a trainspotter, but casual New Order fans would be better off picking up LOW-LIFE or 1983's POWER, CORRUPTION AND LIES. This one is just a footnote.
I got one of these because it was only a penny. I used it several times with only a slight crack that I later cemented. Later I used it again, and, while cocking it back, the whole top piece just splintered into many pieces. The gun is fun for about the first few tries then it's prone to jamming up. Even though it was only a penny, it was $4.99 shipping. I'm better off getting one for about a dollar at a flea market. I'm not very satisfied, but I'm not spending 40 cents to get my 1 penny back
Waste of time. Software had some bugs but more importantly performance was horrible.  I wouldn't pay 10 dollars for this product- yes it is that bad.  Accuracy rate was about 25% and the mistakes were beyond spell check.  They look like some new form of reformed egyption. Don't buy!
A wonderfully complete set for toddlers to set up a complete dinner just like Mommy & Daddy.  the pieces are easily recognizable and realistic.  The children enjoy sharing the dinner with their "friends"
I received the Chia Herb Garden about 3 years ago and not only was it easy to start, but most of the plants are still going strong.  I have more chives and parsley than I know what to do with.  These are also some of the tastiest herbs that I've ever eaten
I tried to tune my daughter's violin for about an hour without luck. --- The manual is not clear, I should say "not enough" instruction for first user like me. --- Finally, on the next day, after asking a friend who already used the tool (but different brand), I could get it done. --- Since the unit is good quality, very sensitive to catch the sound, I rate it 4 stars
You will need this extra base!! I ordered it thinking it would probably be a good idea to have. The day after it arrived my mother-in-law was sick and couldn't come over and watch the baby so my husband placed an emergency call to a relative and they were able to come over and pick him up. I had the original base with me at work 40 minutes away before this all happened
I had purchased two of these Smack and Yack cars for my grandson.  While wrapping them the night before I planned to give the gift, I discovered that they did not make noise as advertised.  If I had looked at them earlier, I would have returned them for a refund.  It's no fun to have grandchildren that are disappointed
These are great blades, installation is very straight forward.  The only gripe I have about these blades is the contact of the blade and the windshield at the extreme right where it ceases to touch my windshield which is about a 1/2", but the odd thing is that the tip does touch my windshield on the up stroke.  But it is so minor that it would not affect the rating at all since these blades has to fit onto so many different cars.  I guess there are no replacement for factory blades
When Mike & The Mechanics ushered in the `Madchester' scene with The Living Years it was only a matter of time before these jokers attempted to jump on the bandwagon. If you want to be adored you should write some decent songs lads! --- Verdict: don't waste your money.
There is only one 100% whole grain bread recipe in this book.  Most of them are less than 50% whole grain.  If you want healthy bread recipes try "Breadtime" by Cheney or "The Laurel's Kitchen Bread Book" by Robertson.  Every recipe in both of those books is 100% whole grain.  I doubt that most people considering a book titled "Whole Grain Breads..." are looking for recipes that contain just a small portion of whole grain ingredients.  With that being said I thought the book had some good recipes and was well written.  Therefore, I am willing to give it 2 stars as opposed to none. 
I used this cream for three weeks, two times a day and it did make some part of my circles lighter- from brown it went to pink. But I skipped one day and it all went back. You pretty much have to be tied to it and keep using it two times a day
The End of Democracy (2003) is the best answer to this theory
Well what else can I say.  I love Zatarain's.  Add a little sausage and you have a great quick meal. 
I got the hang on the 21% and all they could tell me at tech support is to shut down extra services. Well the only services I had running was the security services (firewall and antivirus). As an experiment I tried loading it on two computers set up identically. On one I shut down the antivirus and on the other I shut down the firewall. Neither would install. So I shut down both on both computers and it installed perfectly on both. I cant believe that they want you to shut down security in order to install. Makes me wonder.."What are they hiding that they dont want me to know about". I checked adaware and a registry cleaner and even ran my AV again and found nothing but still... It makes you wonder. Also the layout is very poor, so buggy they have many, MANY patches and updates. Will not print forms correctly and want to charge you fees to e-file when it is free from the governments. They just want more money.  ---  --- In my opinion...DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CRAP. BY THE TIME YOU WASTE YOUR MONEY ON GETTING THIS TO WORK, YOU CAN GET A PROFESSIONAL TO DO IT FOR YOU FOR LESS
I had to decide between this camera and a Panasonic.  we trust the Sony brand a little more, so we went with the Sony.  We were looking for an easy-to-use camera that we could just pick up and record our daughter...nothing professional but good enough quality to enjoy years later.  I also wanted a camera that could take still photos so we wouldn't need both a digital camera and a camcorder when we take vacations.   ---  --- Here's what I think so far: ---  --- Great camcorder to do exactly what we want -- picture looks great inside and out, VERY easy to use, and small enough to carry along almost anywhere.   ---  --- Still photos are not fantastic (only 3MP), but good enough for me.  Color and resolution are acceptable.     ---  --- Not easy to understand the LCD touch menus, but you can configure the buttons once you figure out which buttons you will use the most. ---  --- I got the bare minimums for accessories...bought a 1GB memory card (memory stick duo pro)...glad I did this since I will be taking stills and short video clips to email to the grandparents.  Also got a carrying case, DV tapes, and an extra NP-FP71 battery.  I'll be purchasing a firewire cable soon (I'm sure you've heard, the USB cable is inadequate for downloading video).   ---  --- Handycam station doesn't really bother me that much, but I can see what the fuss is about.   ---  --- All things considered, I'm extremely happy with my purchase.  I think this is a perfect camera for a first-time camcorder buyer who needs an EASY button (there's one on the side of the camera).  A little more expensive than some of the others, but the price is dropping.   ---  --- Best of luck!     
This device is made without varistors, which are burned up as they block transients and surges in power lines. Our AV system and HDTV are connected to it,  It has worked perfectly for the several months we have used it, blocking spikes in the power lines to expensive AV equipment
I've seen Tuners come and go, mostly at a high cost. I bought this to tune both of my guitars and my violin, and so far it hasn't let me down. I thought I had a good ear for tuning but this little gadget quickly corrected me and now my guitar sounds better than ever... Highly recommended
GREAT SCOPE has good zoom and works good for 22. and super 9 air guns. Note that its dovetail and not weaver though Great Scop
Are these journals a Five, or a Three? ---  --- These journals are truly something special.  With the nice, firm cover; lots of pages; a pocket; and elastic to keep them shut, they offer a ton of function for compulsive scribblers. ---  --- But...they demand a little flexibility from the journalist in return.  They don't handle all inks well, and in particular they handle very few fountain pen inks without significant bleed-through. ---  --- So if one commits to a Moleskine journal, one commits to a pen/ink combination that won't bleed--opening up both sides of the paper--or one resigns oneself to wasting the back half of each page. ---  --- For those willing to do a little research, though, the pen/ink combinations are out there (fountain pen users should look up Noodler's Black; for Gel roller users, Pilot's G2 refills also work splendidly with Moleskine).   ---  --- If you want a solid, utilitarian journal, it's tough to beat these, especially at a reasonable price--but the bleeding pages will require adjustments.  It's up to you
I am a user of Acronis backup and very satisfied with it and was hoping that the Disk Director would be the same however it is a little more complicated to use, I partitioned a drive then wanted to convert back and have not yet be able to do so, I know that you can but just haven't found out how yet, it could have been made a little more simplier to use
I have a hard time understanding what it is that I dislike about the novel. I dislike it almost as much as the movie. --- I have been a loyal follower of Smiley and some more after that. Once the Cold War was over, JlC had to look for a new realm. I tried to follow him, but gave up with the Kaukasian troubles, forgot the name of the book. --- Maybe it is this: JlC's trade mark, his USP, is the evilness of the other side. With the KGB & Co., that worked perfectly. His readers were willing to stay with him and believe him. --- Now he is transferring the KGB style to all sorts of other badies. I think it does not work any more. --- It is not that I trust the pharmaceutical companies enough to not be like here insinuated. I do not. --- What I do not like, I guess, is the artificial mood of intellectual suffering from the evilness of all kind of conspiracies. Tess in this story seems to be the normal do-gooder who falls foul with the baddies. That is more ok in the book than in the movie. (There, for my eyes, Rachel Weisz does herself discredit.) --- What is absolutely not ok is the surrender of command by the narrator mid way. JlC gives up on trying to keep a believable storyline and declines into darkest conspiracy allegations
impossible to get off after a good work out. just not for me
I am very disappointed with this product. --- The volume is not adjustable, and the default sound setting is so loud that it can be heard in another room, even with a door closed.  ---  --- Electronic toy voices are occasionally annoying or difficult to understand, this is the case here. So, needing to have something repeated... loudly... can "get on your nerves". ---  --- I will be more careful in the future and not assume that all speaking electronic toys come with adjustable volume. --- Buyers beware!
After going insane with the new version of Norton Systemworks 2005, which doesn't even install, I decided to finally swear off all Symantec products.  ---  --- I have used Zone Alarm Pro for some time. It's not perfect, but it certainly will protect your computer. I took the plunge and went with the full security suite this week, and I've been relatively happy. ---  --- On the plus side, the software works really well. The personal firewall is better than any you can find, and the virus protection found a phishing app that Norton had not (before I had unstalled it). ---  --- On the minus side, the firewall can be problematic. I've had page load issues on Ebay and on my own site which has a cgi script to keep my images and files from being hotlinked (bandwidth theft). When I visit my site or any other that has a similar anti-theft cgi script, the images simply won't come up. Ebay gets all messed up as well. I haven't been able to figure out a setting that works, so I have to turn off the firewall on Ebay and a few other sites, which kind of defeats the purpose of a firewall. This doesn't happen a lot though, so it's not annoying enough to get my dander up. ---  --- All in all it's been a far better investment than Symantec products, so despite its limitations I would recommend this program. It does have a lot of options to set, but they are pretty easy to get through if you are computer literate. ---  --- If you decide to go with this program and you currently have Norton Antivirus, you will need to uninstall Norton before this program will run. ---  --- If you were to ask me if I preferred Symantec Systemworks or Zone Alarm Security Suite, there would be absolutely no hesitation in recommending Zone Alarm. --- 
let me first say this, Roots is basically Paul Simon's Graceland, except nu-metalized. these guys went to south america, cut a couple of terrible tracks with "natives"?, then filled the rest of it out with generic nu-metal crapola with that guy from Korn cut and pasted into the mix for good measure. this is a particularily bad example of the vile and thank-you-god-in-heaven-it's-dead Nu-metal genre-meaningless pissed off lyrics, excessive "guesting" of other crappy artist, bad guitar, bad sitar(!), and the inclusion of anything to do with Korn, all presumabely done with band members sporting loinclothes and Rambo style striped face paint. the biggest waste of time, money, and matter. Its a shame that these guys are living and breathing and taking up space and resources that someone else could be using. A real bummer. 
Jane Fonda plays a washed up has been actress in this movie with a very bad drinking problem. She wakes up one morning next to a guy with a knife in his chest and she can't remember what happened the night before. Then she is on the run when she meets a sympathetic young man played by Jeff Bridges.Unlike Hitchcock movies when the violins start to screetch on the soundtrack then you knw something VERY BAD is going to happen. The violins in this movie play pretty loud but nothing happens. I figured out "Whodunnit" in the first 30 minutes of this film and then spent the next hour trying to figure out if Fonda's hair was a wig or did she get her own hair bleached blonde?I give this movie 5 stars because I liked the look of the loft where the dead guy lives
I gave this 5 stars only because it serves its purpose well. It's just a basic mouse pad, but the price is excellent!!
The greatest tasting syrup ever made. Excellent on toast, no other syrup can come close. Forty years ago I thought it was the greatest and it still is! I am having a hard time purchasing it in my province in Canada and it is worth the effort to order it on line. I wish they would expand their distribution
The compatibility with Nokia phones should not have to be listed because very clearly in BOLD letters-within the title-it says "Universal 2.5mm Jack"  Universal meaning ALL 2.5mm jacks. Not all cell phones.  Know your phone and your aquisition before giving a bad review.  Great product
No doubt about it, from start to finish, this is a classic for anybody's collection. I can remember back in the spring of '93 when the movie came out and it was a classic as well but the soundtrack matches up to what the movie was and this soundtrack sent a big message to a lot of us about what goes on the inner cities today. This was rap music at it's best from Spice 1 to DJ Quik. There will not be a soundtrack like this ever again that addresses what goes on in our neighborhoods. So add this to your collection if you still love the true gangster rap, west coast fan(like myself), or just want to hear a great soundtrack
I'm gonna quote a paragraph from the book, please note - in no way can this paragraph tell you anything about the book or spoil it for those who havent read it. ---  --- " A woman left at home would close her eyes and the power of her need would enable her to see her man on his ocean ship battling pirates with pistol, her man in the battle's fray with his sword and shield, standing victorious among corpses, her man in a desert whose sands were on fire, amid mountain peaks, drinking the driven snow. So long as he lived she would follow his journey, would feel his elation and his grief, and if he died a spear of love would fly back across the world to pierce her waiting omniscient heart. It would be the same for him. IN the midst of desert's fire he would feel her cool hand on his cheek and in the heat of battle she would murmur the words of love into his ear : live, live. That was what the stories said about love. That was what human beings knew love to be." ---  --- Shalimar the Clown was about as good as I thought it would be. It definitely isn't the best book I've read this year but I must say Salman Rushdie's writing style captivates me nonetheless. In between the most relevant paragraphs, he says things that are unique and have a true stronghold on the reader's mindset. In this book, he mentions a quote, twice, which really caught my eye. "One doesn't know the questions of life until one is asked" ---  --- Another thing I noticed about the book is that the central character, Shalimar, is seldom mentioned. The book seems to hover around other dozen characters. Only in prison and in that one letter sent back to Kashmira does Shalimar's true character really come out. The second quarter of the book got immensely boring and I really despise how Max's character was written about. It was annoying, difficult to read, over-detailed and excruciating to read. ---  --- Boonyi was an outstanding character. So was the old witch and Boonyi's father. When Colonel Tortoise was mentioned in the book, I thought his character would prove of some consequence but nothing about yielded anything. One couldn't help but dislike Max's lack of integrity. Mythology is rather well written about in this book. Every 50 pages, a one page something would be mentioned including just the right amount of detail and words. ---  --- Conclusion - ---  --- While reading,time and again I would rage on to my friend about how superb the writer's grasp on the reader is. The writer knows his words,where to use them, he knows that he has a prodigious way of writing and he employed them better than ever. Maybe this book disappointed his core fans. Maybe it LACKED A SPARK enough to obilerate doubt. ---  --- All in all, I can say that Salman Rushdie has a wierd way of his own. His vocabulary is truly astounding. Maybe he is the most "learned" writer I've ever read, if not the best. Respect.  ---  ---  --- H.S Anand --- -17th October'06 12.13P
  After purchasing the program thinking it would perform a through check on my Presario running XP Home all I get is a message that SSP6 has unexpectedly quite. I emailed tech support w/ the info, but so far no response after 10 days. There is no # to call for support. Maybe I overlooked something.  ---   Also, I submitted the rebate form which came on the package, but was told that the seller was not participating in the rebate program and I need to check w/ them. I did and they said they shipped what VCOM had provided them, which included a rebate form if doing a competitive upgrade. ---   Not very impressed w/ either the software or the company. Would never buy another product from these guys, even when the price after rebate is 0. LOF
I suggest watching the original version: Sword of Doom - which is amazing. A lot less acid is involved, and less cliche. Izo is a rent, at best
I own a lot of strollers for my twin sons ((this one, the duoglider, two small single strollers, and a double umbrella stroller)) and I absolutely LOVE this one! ---  --- First of all, if you want to be a satisfied customer you have to know what the purpose of the stroller is, which is for jogging, or maneuvering outdoors on rough terrain. My husband jogs with the stroller at least once a week ((and has no complaints)), but I on the other hand just adore it for the outdoors. The wheels go over almost any surface, including gravel, dirt, grass, concrete, brick, sand, boardwalk anything, I love it. The seats both fully recline ((individually)) and when they do, the rear of the seat is mesh so you can see your child from behind ((although you would most-likely have to bend down to get a good look)). The five-point harness on a jogger is a MUST HAVE, and this model even comes with comfortable pads as well. The basket is HUGE and holds everything we need for a day at the beach/park/walk around the block, which is very important to me. It is also removable, but I don't see why it would be advantageous to take it off. Plenty of other storage is available behind the seats as well, handy little pockets and pouches to store little knick-knacks. Considering the type of stroller it is, it folds very easily, and I can fit it in the rear of my minivan after removing the rear and front tires ((which is equally as easy to do, rear tires come off with the push of a button and the front has an easy to use release mechanism)). The canopy is enormous and proves for GREAT sun protection when needed! The breaks are FANTASTIC, and stop the stroller in its tracks which is very important if you are jogging, and need to stop quickly, according to my husband anyway. The included wind/rain shield is also very convenient ((can be left rolled up to the top of the canopy, incase there is a chance of rain you don't have to work for 5 minutes to attach it and get the kiddos wet)), but I do wish it also came with mesh covers for mosquitos and other bugs. ---  --- I do dislike the fact that it is EXTREMELY difficult to turn ((although I have kind of gotten it down to a science, you need to be prepared for the turn and tilt the stroller a bit, the turn is very wide and not that smooth)). I think it would be better if it had a swivel wheel which had the option to lock in place for jogging ((a swivel wheel would actually be extremely dangerous if jogging as you could lose control of the stroller)), but that's just me personally. The baskets are near impossible to access if both seats are reclined all the way, and I have had to wake sleeping babies on a few occasions ((that's why I have learned to put things such as my cell phone and wallet in the canopy pouches, so I don't have to constantly go into the basket)). The canopy is quite large, and if you are not using it its quite a pain to retract as it doesn't go back neatly, and if its a windy day the canopy doesn't always stay up. ---  --- If you are looking for a good stroller for outdoor use, and don't mind the large size or getting used to turning, then I highly recommend the Tike Tech
The front material is cheap feeling and grainy.  Also, there is a large plastic gold-colored Cris Notti button adorning the front that does not appear in the online picture.  Otherwise it is functionally useful and of good quality
this baby gate is ideal for the size and price.  i had shopped tons of stores and websites before i had found this gate.  the hardware mount, eye hooks, are not the sturdiest, but this gate definately gets the job done
Sometimes the National Enquirer is the only place to find the true story about a subject - for example it broke the story about O. J.'s shoes. I guess you have to pick and choose your articles. Some of the articles, I admit, are useless. However, other articles are interesting and some you can't find anyplace else
The product doesnt appear as is shown on the picture at all. Its not Red and its too small to even imagine.I knew it would appear bit smaller than on picture but this is beyond my imagination.The chain can break any time!!! And the stud!!!!!!!gosh...i cant even see it! Now i'm gonna check if its really gold or not!! --- DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT!SAVE YOURSELF THE MONEY
I  bought this swing for our first child specially because it has many features.....overall I am happy with it and our son seems to enjoy it....but few things I wish it had is ....one that the seat could be reclined and two is that the toys made some kind of noise to get attention.Overall for the price it is good
Our 21-month old daughter has been using this tub since birth and we love it!  It does hold water and she can splash around and play with her toys.  The sunctions are great since they do stick pretty good to the tub.  Easy to clean and easy to put away when my husband or I need to use our regular tub
I was about to buy an escape hammer when I spotted this Keychain Rescue Tool. I like that it is small enough to store close to the driver's seat. Fortunately, I have not had the need to use it
i bought this thinking that this would be fun and a decent workout, i tried it a few times but just couldnt get in to it. it go's a bit fast but i know i could get used to it, but they have very big steps and they lung into it and i think it would be better if they work up to it i kept finding myself rewinding it to do the step corretly i dont realy strive for perfection i just want to do it some what right. there are better ones out there than this, but i think i am going to try it again cuz it wasnt so bad that i am going to quit it
Radica used to amke good hand held electronic games; this was is cheap. Buttons need to be pressed unusually hard to respond.  dark screen that lights up only when the room is nearly pitch black
Excellent service, ontime delivery, perfect match for my grill.  Thanks for the detailed descriptions and pictures of the products you sell. 
except for the nifty little metal clips that keep the strap at the length you set until you press on it to lengthen/shorten the strap again. Does exactly what it is supposed to do, and makes for challenging exercises due to the inherent instability. Great for spotting oneself too. I would buy it again, tho I don't think it is as indispensible as some might have you believe. So if you can burn the $35 or so, get it with no fear. Otherwise, use your frustration to fuel your desire to workout
I have used this product for the past 16 years. It is wonderful!The Super Double Face Powder is actually a foundation and matte powder all rolled into one product. The product comes with an application sponge, goes on dry, gives superb coverage! I don't even use my Clinique concelar when I wear this product, it is that good! This product works best with those individuals who have normal or combination skin.
Ingredients: High Fructose Corn Syrup and Hydrogenated Oil.  --- Do a search and see what you think. I won't touch this stuff.
This is an awesome set!!  My husband and I use it all the time.  It looks great and can really take a beating
Simply put, Xenogears + Xenosaga 1 & is the absolute best storyline, and best role playing experience on the PS2 to date. --- I do strongly believe that Xenosaga 2 has the best storyline in any RPG I have ever, ever played, including Final Fantasy 7, Xenogears, and hundreds of others. Because RPGs are strongly reliant on storyline for gameplay, I consider this to be the pinnacle of Role Playing on the PS2. Final Fantasy X comes close, as does Star Ocean, but in terms of storyline, this game beats them. --- However, I did have to mark down for a few other minor flaws. This game is highly a niche game, only for those who enjoy the style, and the sci fi setting. It's also very short.....20 hours if you play straight through (no leveling up). Maybe 38-42 hours if you take up the side-quests and want a strong character. ---  --- Gameplay: The first Xenosaga highly relied on cut scenes and narrative. In fact, I absolutely could not stand the battle system. Xenosaga Episode 2 still relies heavily upon that storytelling through hours of cut scenes, but it fixes the battle system. ---  --- The battle system is, simply put, one of the most fun turn-based systems I have ever experienced. While Xenosaga Episode 1's battle system seemed slow and unwieldy, Episode 2 has a fast paced, action packed, and highly challenging battle system. ---  --- You have 3 characters on the screen at just about all times, these characters can be switched off in a manner much like FFX, but it costs a turn in this game, causing it to be more tactical. ---  --- Each turn you have many options; you can attack (more on various attacks later), stock (save a turn for the next turn in order to get a combo), use ether (read: magic), or change your battle party. ---  --- If you choose to attack, there is a whole slew of options here as well. Most importantly is learning the weak points of the enemy. Every enemy, including bosses, have a certain attack combination that will be most effective against them. When you attack, you can press either square, which is a B zone attack, Triangle, which is a C zone attack, or circle, which is another B zone attack. Certain characters also have an A zone attack, but this is only against flying opponents. You must expierament with the enemies in order to learn the zones they are weakest in. Sometimes, you may be required to 'stock' for a turn in order to attack the enemy in its weak zone. ---  --- "What is the advantage of attacking weak zones?" you ask. Well, it allows for large scale, damage pounding comboes that are absolutely essential in this game. Once you have hit all of the enemy's weak zones, you can do a "break" on them. This involves the circle button. Once a character is 'broken', they can be tossed into the air, or attacked while prone on the ground. This can add up to tons of damage if you plan your boosting right. ---  --- Boosting is another integral part of the combat system. Pressing the R1 button brings up a 3 slot meter which is sometimes empty, but it may feature the character potraits of some of your characters. If you press R1, and then the button (square, triangle, or circle) that that character's potrait is on, they will boost forward, and immediately after the acting unit has taken its turn, this new character will have a turn. ---  --- Enemies, however, can take advantage of all of these systems as well. If you do not plan well, or randomly attack without comboes, the enemy will break you, boost ahead several times, and can easily destroy one of your characters in one short, brutal assault. Countless times my entire party was destroyed by simple enemies that should have been no problem, merely because I did not plan ahead. You will get very, very used to seeing the game over screen. The plus side of this difficulty is that you feel real exhiliration when you win, it is a great accomplishment. Note that even with power levelling, it won't help you much in some situations, believe me, I tried. ---  --- Finally, there is Ether. Ether skills are basically magic, if you know anything about RPGs at all, then you know basically what is present here, healing ether skills, attack ether skills, nothing big. ---  --- I forgot to mention the E.S. units. These are basically mechs, and were called A.G.W.S. in Episode 1. Many points in the game involve you using these to move around and fight, and now they have an independant battle system. It's basically the same as the one with your characters on screen, except that you only have one attack a turn, no comboes or anything like that. It is just an added piece of fun to an already awesome game. ---  --- There is a skill system in place. After every battle you earn class pointss and/or skill points. These can be spent on getting new ether skills, or new upgrades to your characters that can make them more resilient when you equip them. Every character has the same skill set, and this is a minor flaw that slightly brings down the gameplay score, but not the overall enjoyment in the least. ---  --- Finally, one other flaw with the gameplay is that there are no weapons, and no armor. Both of these are RPG standard fare, and it seems kind of odd to not have either. This may just be something the developers decided not to do that I disagree with, but it still seems a little odd. Note that this really does not detract from the game in any way. ---  --- In Xenosaga 2, they also opted to add a lot more puzzle solving than episode 1 had. The interesting thing is that these puzzles, while challenging, don't take away from the gameplay expierience at all. In fact, I found many to be very enjoyable. ---  --- The storyline of this game is simply incredible. But, keep in mind that it is basically required that you have beaten Xenosaga episode 1 if you want to understand it at all, or at least be acquainted with the story in some manner. If you haven't played it, the best way is to get the bonus DVD that came with the game, there are probably some somewhere around, maybe even on ebay, that allows you to see 4 hours of cut scenes from the original. This can substitute in for those who dont want to spend the 60-80 hours required on Xenosaga episode 1 to beat it. ---  --- Anyway, I digress, Xenosaga 2's storyline is more of the space opera fun. Often times I got very emotional, and the game can tug on your heartstrings. In the ending sequence of the game, a spectacular event lasting about 15 minutes, I was seriously in tears. This game can do that to you, the storyline is that good. It is also filled with entrigue, betrayal, new discoveries, and new secrets. It is truly incredible. I have seen certain reviews that say the storyline doesn't solve everything, it doesn't solve all the mysteries. Let me tell you something: it's not supposed to. Xenosaga is going to be a 4-8 part series, and the storyline is continuous. It makes no sense at all to have the story be complete in only episode II. I see no reason why anyone could possibly complain about it. ---  --- Graphics: The graphics of Xenosaga 2 are basically the same as they were in episode 1. No real improvements at all. They are still great though, and the cut scenes are gorgeous. My one real complaint here is that the lip sync is sometimes off (a problem with just about every RPG with voice overs), and some of the environments are a little dull. This is made up for in the environments that are simply breathtaking. ---  --- Sound: The soundtrack of Xenosaga Episode 2 is godlike. From the opening theme to the battle music to the catchy Japanese sounding tunes that ring in your head forever, this music is INCREDIBLE. The voice acting is also absolutely superb, I have zero complaints, this is a rarity. Sound effects are also very appropriate, and very well done. ---  --- Value: The game is hurt in the value department only because of its length. To put it in perspective, the first playthrough took me about 28 hours, but more like 30 if you count all the times I died and had to go back to the point I got killed at. After you win, you can use your game clear file to access even more goodies like some bonus bosses, dungeons, and side quests, and this helps make up for the shorter length. Personally, I think its the best $50 I have ever spent. ---  --- Tilt: Finally, the overall enjoyment. This game is simply the most enjoyable game I have played on the PS2. I completed it after several all-night gaming sessions, and it will most likely keep you up too. The Role Playing experience here is superb, the storyline is possibly the best in RPG history, and the battle system is incredible and in depth. There is virtually nothing not to like. As an avid RPG gamer, I recommend this game as highly as is possible. However, there are a few things to consider: can you handle the challenge, and do you like the Space Opera/Anime feel? If you answered yes to both, get this game
I waited and waited for an order from JD foods to come for a Xmas gift.  Even received a notice that the order was placed and correct...only to find out through my OWN efforts that the product was discontinued.  Bad communication.  Will not make that mistake again
The color tabs really help you know what section to look at. The only disadvantages of this field guide are that it doesn't document every species in North America and that the new National Geographic Field Guide to the Birds of North America, Fifth Edition has the Blue Grouse split into the Sooty and Dusky Grouse making it more up to date!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  ---  --- Still, this field guide has many good things.
Okay, I am new to the world of stargazing.  I purchased this telescope based on recommendations here at Amazon.com.  I have been completely satisfied.  I am especially impressed with the clear, crisp viewing of the moon.  I can see a few planets, but they are of course very small through the eyepiece. ---  --- I do have a suggestion to anyone who may purchase this telescope.  Take your time putting it together.  Read all the directions first.  Pay special attention to the details concerning the Collimator.  If you don't know what that is, you need to.  I almsot made some major mistakes, screwing and unscrewing parts that needed to be left alone.   ---  --- If you pay attention to all of the details on the instructions, you will have the telescope together in a couple of hours and be well on your way to enjoying yourself, especially on a clear night. ---  --- The package containing my telescope arrived in four days and was completely intact.  I couldn't be happier with my purchase.  I am sure a more avid sky-watcher might want a little something more, but for the once-in-a-while gazer, this is the telescope. ---  --- See ya next review. ---  --- 
Esquire may be a man's magazine, but I enjoy the articles as a woman, because it is no holes barred feedback with the rough edges included. I got my first issue a couple weeks back, and found it funny, informative, great pic of Tom Petty, and I'm looking forward to more issues
I bought these inexpensive zills for my students to use in class, as I was running low on loaners. Of course, I wasn't expecting top quality instruments, but they are just great for students to use in class while they're learning -- and still leave the student some motivation to buy a personal set of high-quality zills! They came in individual zip-lock bags, and even included tiny safety pins.  ---  --- Perfect for teachers buying for a whole classroom
  The classic Final Fantasy games (1-3 [not 6]) are NOTORIOUS for their difficulty.  This does not hold true until you reach the center of the moon.   Then, you will find yourself guzzling Elixirs, Potions, and Ethers just to kill ONE monster.  For example, the Behemoths (found past B5 in the center of the moon, and in Bahamuts cave) will counter every spell and attack with a brutal 2300 hit on one party member.  Most of the boss fights (Asura, Bahamut) and tough monsters (Behemoths, Wicked Masks) are gimmick fights.  Bahamut is actually one of the easiest fights in the game, just cast Reflect on all of your party members. ---   Let me reinstate what the previous reviewers have said about this game --- + Crisp graphics --- + Great music + sound --- + Fun --- + More to do once you beat the game --- - Somewhat short (beat EG Zeromus in 18hrs 42mins) --- - Very difficult --- - Prepare to grind 10-15 levels once you reach the center of the moon! ---  --- I enjoyed this, and you can bet I'm getting FF3 for the DS.  Great blast from the past, a must-buy for any Final Fantasy fan, RPG lover, or GBA owner

Compared to my logitech mouseman dual optical from 2000, this mouse blows it away by far in accuracy, precision.  What I find to be a drawback is the mouse's light weight and small size.  The size comes in handy if I need to flick, but be sure to keep the wire out of the way - as the mouse is so light if you have the wire in a bad spot, it will push the mouse and affect your aim at crucial moments. The "change sensitivity" button is in a strange spot (at least if u have large hands) located in the center of the mouse where you will need to reach far back and almost touch the pad of your palm of the finger you're reaching with - not an efficient movement, therefore not applicable in games (you can assign a sensitivity script to perhaps one of the side mouse buttons if necessary).  These are only minor itches when compared to the outstanding precision and I would highly recommend it
Would highly recommend this product -- I've bought it for friends even, to show them that granola could be this wonderful.  I've tried the Flax Plus also, but it wasn't as good as the Hemp Plus.  I would also recommend the bar form of this product, which doesn't seem to be on Amazon currently and is a bit pricy in stores
Once we took this net out of the box I knew it wouldn't work. Our balcony railing was not only longer, but shorter in height, than the net so we had to wrap it around the top railing. The "strings" used to secure the net did not look strong enough to me and the whole set up looked ridiculous. I am searching for an alternative
I was dying to get my hands on these after reading such wonderful endorsements.  I had nothing but high hopes.  I was totally open minded.  I thought it seemed too good to be true (low cal no carb noodles!) but hey, I'm an optimist.  Guess what? It is too good to be true!  I read about washing them and drying them.  I did.  No problem.  I added sauce.  I put them in my mouth.  The taste was not the problem it was the texture.  It was seriously like chewing rubber bands.  No noodle resemblence whatsoever.  I honestly can't understand those who rave about these, but, hey, to each his own
Great taste, excellent spicy flavor (with or without meat added).  One of the best dried packaged soups ever
I've subscripted to Gourmet for years but I let my subscription run out.  The lifestyle articles keep pushing out the recipies.  As I read through food magazines I dog-ear the page with a recipe I want to try.  In the last year there were very few dog-eared pages and it wasn't worth continuing the subscription
This is now on clearance at Target... $199.99.  They're going fast, I hid one in a display wooden chest in the furniture department til it drops even lower
I bought this as a gift for my 81 year old mother, who is impossible to please.  She needed a new card shuffler, as she wasn't pleased with her plastic, battery operated one.  I must admit, I thoroughly expected to have to return it, since I knew she wouldn't be pleased with it.  As it turns out, I did have to return it, but here's the surprise.  I was very disappointed in its performance too!  We could not get it to shuffle cards, whether they be from a new deck, or an old, worn out, dog eared deck.  Moral of this story -- please don't buy this item, whether you're difficult to please or not
I don't have twins, however I have an infant and a toddler and it works --- great for them. I go jogging every morning with the kids and  --- it is the most comfortable stroller I have used yet.  --- Thank you!!
Tinkyada makes the BEST brown rice pasta!  My kids eat it with just butter and shaved parmesan and never notice that it's not regular semolina pasta.  With a hearty meat sauce, my husband can't even tell the difference.  Definitely recommended
This watch is totally accurate. And with glow in the dark hands and numerals and an oversized date window, it is the perfect watch. It makes it a pleasure to look at my wrist
These JavoScreen Treo 650 protectors are really very different from anything you've normally seen.  Typically, 95% of the screen protectors are that very thin material that you stick on the screen, hope against hope that you don't have bubbles, but you almost always do. When the screen is off, you see the bubbles, thankfully when the screen is on, the bubbles are pretty invisible..... BUT these JavoScreen protectors are a completely different animal.  They are thick, and tough, and relatively firm.  And because of those properties, they go on with NO bubbles, and they are easily moveable (adjustable) should you not get it on perfectly the first time.  Further, they come with a little squeegee thingy to make sure its on there good.  This is the state of the art for screen protectors.  And this all becomes an even bigger issue for men, because of whiskers, over time the screen will get dulled and scratched.  Because of the thickness and quality of these, scratches to the screen are no longer an issue.
When I first came to Iran, black clad women all seemed the same. Scary unsmiling servants of the Ayatollas ---  --- Having visited the Islamic Republic of Iran in June, I was better prepared for that vast country portrayed by Elaine Sciolino in her book Persian Mirrors. I am more than grateful for this book, which alerted me to the diversity of cultures, and the general way of life so absolutely different from the Western world. --- Elaine Sciolino made me so very aware of the perfect social world of the Iranians and also I am thrilled to say that once you make a friend of an Iranian, you have a friend for life. --- My most treasured memories of Iran will never leave me and I thank Ms Sciolino for preparing me for that journey.  --- Reviewed by Heather Marshall Negahdar (SUGAR-CANE 11/10/05)
Being a fan of Jack Johnson, I thought this one would be as good as the others.  I wasn't impressed at all.  It sounds like a few guys pickin' around in the basement.  The recording quality has very little production value.  At best, these are okay live versions of usually great songs.  This is an unnecessary piece for your Jack Johnson collection.
I purchased your "Space Saver Highchair" for my 9 month old daughter who is severely disabled. Finding equipment for the very young disabled child is very difficult.  This chair works for everything!  This chair is so comforatable for my daughter and allows her to sit up and play with her toys as she gets very bored laying on her back all day.  She also has a very difficult time playing with her toys as her grasp is not well controlled and she is constantly dropping toys on her face or off to the side and cannot get them back in her hand. I love this chair for its size, the way the whole seat tilts (not just the back), and the 5 point harness.  The chair is also small so it holds her very nicely.  My daughter loves nothing more than to sit in this chair all the time
It was broken in a few days of use, you should buy a hard cover instea
I bougt this camera because I had had a Sony Coolpix 3, which took great pictures.  With this camera, you can never get it adjusted right.  If you use the flash the  pictures are to light, if you dont they are too dark.  It is a constant battle with this little cute camera. Worse camera purchase I ever made.
This UV filter does it job to protect the lens well. The build is solid (metal construction). The glass is also descent quality.  ---  --- About the performance, it absorbs some UV light. The UV light absorbtion is hardly noticeable, probably the sky 1-A and the haze filter version will absorb more UV light than this lens which is fine for me.  ---  --- Now, about the one problem which is the internal reflection. I've heard many people say that it mostly happens during night or low light shooting. I found out that it is not caused directly by the low light/night situation. The internal reflection will appear when there is a strong/bright source of light in comparison to the overall exposure (the surrounding environment). To put it in example (which hopefully is easier to understand), when you take a picture of a lamp during nightime and the light is much brighter than the surrounding area then you will see the internal reflection. as you move the position of the light to be closer to the sides/corner of the picture (and not in the center of the picture), the internal reflection reduces and finally dissapear (if you move the light far enough from the center). And if the light isn't too bright/contrast compare to the surrounding environment then there will be no internal reflection. but of course most of the time, a lamp at nightime is often very bright. But the point that I'm trying to make is that the internal reflection doesn't happen all the time during low light or night time.  ---  --- Additionally, the internal reflection isn't only happening at night. it can also happen in the afternoon if you are taking a picture of a sun for example. basically same rule as above, on how bright is the light source compared to the surrounding area, and as you move the sun from the center of the photo and near the side the internal reflection will move to the side/dissapear (also depending the angle). But the best way is just to remove the filter during these situations.  ---  --- Hope this explanation helps you to reduce the occurence of internal reflection by identifying correctly when the internal reflection will occur and then remove the filter during those situation (which is not hard to do).  ---  --- I'm actually not a fan of lens filter (any filter) as I think it will only degrade picture quality as we added another layer between the sensor and object, but I decided to use them anyway for all my lens. And I would recommend everyone to get one of this filter if you don't have any filter for your lens yet. 
Without a doubt this is the best product of its type, I looked at several others priced significantly higher, and after setting up the AM2 it was clear I had made the best choice
Painting the plates is a fun activity because you can be creative. The only problem is that you have to be careful or they could crack or break
This film is visually stunning and impressive, and has talented and credible actors.   ---  --- Unfortunately, there is barely a story with a lot of poorly-developed characters who are "trained"/brainwashed and instructed in the ways of death and inhumanity.   ---  --- The settings and group "sermons" from Nazi officials are striking and convincing, but there is nothing that ties it all together.  Our hero fails to strike the "killer blow" and is stripped, literally and figuratively, of all status and walks away.  The end. ---  --- I'm forced to comment that this is marketed as a gay film, and I was surprised by how un-gay it was.  In fact, the two boy "friends" work together at one point to spy on a lady in a state of undress.  It's more about a childhood relationship in the midst of chaos than anything else.  ---  --- I have issues with some of the pacing as well.  I found myself pressing the fast forward button several times, and didn't really seem to miss much.  Not a good sign. ---  --- So, for what it is, it's okay.  Certainly not a masterpiece, and certainly not something to run out and buy. 
Excellent watch at a great price.  The teal color is absolutely beautiful and I love the style.  I have several Fossil watches and no complaints.  They are easily adjustable, water resisant, and polish up nicely to look like new again
Finally a cute pink car seat.  It is duralble and easy to lift around. I wish they had this cute color for my other daughter.  Ihave not deliverd yet so I don't know how she will fit in it,  But I also have the stroller and everyone who sees the matching combo tells me how cute it is.  There is not any other pink combo out there.  I just hope it works as well as it shows off
Canon's BG-E3 battery grip is one awesome extra you cannot be without.  I found the extra weight and size NOT to be even a minor burden.   I rec'd product 2 days after initial receiving date/17th St Photo did a fantastic job (once again)
A friend of mine has Zombies!!!, also by Twilight Creations.  I've played it a few times, and found it pretty enjoyable.   ---  --- Zombietown is sort of a followup to this in some ways, and tries to expand the strategy of the game somewhat. ---  --- Unfortunately, it ends up far too confusing and complicated to make for fast gameplay (it's often very slow, in fact), and the strategy is more shallow than Risk.   ---  --- Ya know the stereotypically confusing instructions of insert Tab A into Slot B?  That's pretty much what the instructions to this read like.  They're fairly poorly written to boot.  There were also a couple problems we ran into the rules didn't seem to cover.  I can't recall them off the top of my head, and they didn't come up very often, but it was still irritating. ---  --- Overall, definetly not reccomended.  At $40 in stores, and $35 off Amazon, it's also a HUGE ripoff.  What do you get in the box?  Like 100 tiny army men-esque figures, a couple of packs of cards, and a laminated piece of cardboard.  I understand why it is expensive, as I'm sure this was a low budget item and such, but Zombies!!! was much less expensive. 
Dont buy it from Andrew Christian, i wrote them online several times and never, not once, got an answer from them, i ended up buying them some other place
This was a gift for my 17 year old daughter and she absolutely loves it and wears all the time!!!! I am seriously thinking of getting myself one
Cajun Cuisine is, without a doubt, the best Cajun cookbook that I've ever used.  I was born and reared in Southern Louisiana, and the recipes detailed within closely mirror the exact techniques, seasonings, and spices  that I had learned by watching both my grandmothers in their kitchens, and  how I was personally taught by my grandfather at his hunting camp.  You  CANNOT go wrong with this book!                                    Jacque
I love this blanket so much let me count the ways...(1) certified organic (so hard to find), (2) large enough for a good, tight swaddle (for a good night sleep), (3) darling drawing showing how to swaddle baby sewn to blanket (even my husband can now swaddle like a nurse), (4) soft, soft, and softer with every wash! I just love this blanket and I feel so good wrapping my little bundle in the ULTIMATE - and I know he loves it too
my kids love this it fades right into the next color they fall right to sleep watching it change its an awesome light i was very pleased and its not to bright like some light up the room its just perfect mom of a 3 and 5 yr old !!
The jock has good support but the material used is quite abrasive. The elastic and threads bite into your skin. If you use this one for sports, you will constantly be distracted. The feel of the material used is very rough against your skin, esp at the waist
This is the perfect monitor for the average person.  The chest strap communicates with the machines at my gym so I don't have to look at the watch while using the machines.  While walking or jogging the watch provides a quick way to know your heart rate.  I haven't used the other features that are offered so I can't rate them, but it does everything that I wanted out of it when I purchased it
This isn't a consistent product. 99% of the time, I can't get it to work. After MONTHS of emails and phone calls, customer service responded. What a joke! They told me the plug in the unit and then unplug, wait 30 seconds, and then plug in. Gimme a break! I shouldn't have to do the Hokie Pokie just to get it to work. By the way, their process didn't work. Poor product, Poor customer service, Poor price

The umbrella I ordered is fine, just what I had hoped it would be. However, I subsequently ordered an umbrella stand (after you prompted me to do so) and when it arrived the two tightening screws  in the shaft had been damaged in shipment. Each of the screws have plastic knobs and the knobs were broken off. As a result when one tightens them the broken plastic is sharp enough to cut skin. I have tried unsuccessfully to find replacements at a hardware store.  Any suggestions
I am not at all happy with this product. The instructions are terrible and the program is not at all intuitive. It was a total waste of my money and time.
I have been aware of NaturallySpeaking for over 15 years.  We initially utilized this software to assist people with severe disabilities such as cerebral palsy to be able to have basic commands understood.  More recently five years ago I bought edition 4.0.  I found it to be frustrating when ever there was any background noise so I basically quit using it.  When I saw the 8.0 being advertised as the voice recognition software specifically for a small business atmosphere, I thought I would try it one more time.  Being a slow typist it has truly changed my life for the better.  Only 45 minutes were required to set up the speech-recognition files when the occasional mistakes occur during dictation if you correct those and change those right at that time, I never see that same misunderstanding happening again.  I have recommended it to two friends who are buying it.  It really does allow you to sit back in your chair relax, drink your coffee and dictate reports, answer e-mail or whenever it is you might need to do.  I can't think of any $70 expenditure that has given me so much back in such a short time.  I almost always have my headset on when I'm in front of the computer because anything that involves typing or entering data I used the DragonDictate to do
My first pregnancy I tried several styles of belts, most of which had a wide band in back. I am short, have a short midriff, and am overweight, so wider belts would roll from the top down.  I never had that problem with this belt.  Unfortunately, this pregnancy I am entering my 3rd trimester and have finally out grown the 1X belt, and the store I purchased it from is now closed.  I was thrilled when I found this on Amazon.com in a larger size.   ---  --- I recommend making it little snug in the mornings and then loosening it throughout the day as needed.  The most appealing feature for me is that this band is completely adjustable to give you the support you need for the different activities you will be doing throughout the day.  Any time you start needing the extra support, just slightly tighten the side straps.  When you start relaxing or if the belt starts feeling a little tight, just loosen it up a bit.  It's quick and easy to work with, and if one side needs more support than the other, just make that one side a bit more snug.  It's AWESOME! ---  --- I am a technology education specialist, so I'm on my feet for, many times, 16 hrs a day training and supporting hospitals with their new computer programs.  I couldn't have survived even my First Trimester without this belt.  I raise it a little higher in the back so that I have complete lower back support and belly support.  There were days when I forgot to wear my belt that I almost couldn't walk after only 4 hrs of work due to lower back pain that would eventually extend down to my fanny and legs.  My legs would litterally give out from underneath me until I could rub and relax my lower back for a while.  When you are working with doctors in the surgery room or doing rounds with them this is NOT a good thing.  As long as I wore my belt, I NEVER had a problem.   ---  --- I strongly recommend this product
My husband and I were introduced to Market Spice Tea in 1984 while we were living for a few months in Seattle.  We loved it and, upon our return to Jamesville, NY, begain to regularly order it.  Many of our friends now order it, too.  It is an ideal hot drink in the winter and equally good iced in the summer.  23 years and counting it is still our favorite tea
I have an older version of this charger that I bought in the mid 90's. I used it to maintain my garaged Mustang's battery over the winter months for many years. I made a cigarette lighter adapter so all I needed to do was to plug it in instead of using the alligator clips. I have to say this thing is dead reliable! It always kept my battery in prime condition. I love it and recommend it highly. 
My daughter is almost 6 and we got her this for Christmas.  The commercials made it look really cool and easy for kids, no more scissors!  Well we opened it today and it's too hard for her to hold the button down for any amount of time and to move it around slowly enough to actually cut anything.  I'm having to do it all for her and my hand gets tired too!  They should have made it that the "pen" cuts when just being pushed on the paper or something.  I have a 9 year old also that was trying to use it and it wasn't all that easy for him either.  Seems more like something teens or adults that scrapbook would use
Great improvements over the original DVD. Enhanced for 16x9 TVs with scenes that are now clearer and actually 2.35:1 widescreen ratio.  The original dvd claims an aspect ratio of "approximately 2.35:1" which was not true. I own both versions and have compared viewing aspects  of each. Clearly this DVD is far superior and well worth the purchase price.  This plays very well on my HDTV monitor; I'll give the old version to someone w/ an old 4x3 TV. 
The S9000 fits perfectly in the case. Too bad the case has no strap and no belt loop. Apparently, the camera strap is supposed to function as the case strap also. Too bad the camera strap is extremely short, made for very small people. So, instead of returning it and using a generic case that would not protectthe camera as well, I will adapt the case to work for me. I will get a bigger aftermarket strap for the camera. I can take the case to my seamstress and have a belt loop sewn on. It will work but only after extensive modification. Great camera design so it's odd that the case appears to have been designed by someone who has never used a camera before
I got this a few years back, and it is a very important member of our household still! My wrist was smashed in an auto accident many years ago and i no longer have the ability to hold free weight above my neck... the possibilities are atrocious. With the bowflex if i let go for any reason the potential catastrophe is avoided. ---  --- There is no stress or strain except for the muscle group you are trying to focus upon. Well made, well designed, and very well built. Like our Dyson vacuum, this is a quality product utilizing quality engineering. It may be perfect for the elderly or female/male non bodybuilder athlete because of it's non need for a spotter and the ease of changing resistance! ---  --- I am happy with my build, i don't want to be bodybuilder, if you do this may not be the correct machine for you... like it is for me at 43! ---  --- that is my opinion, and like all the others... i'm sticking to it! ---  --- thank you for your tim

I did a lot of looking before purchassing a Krusell, and opted to pay a little bit more for a product that appeared to be top notch.  It was a great investment.  The Krusell case holds the Blackberry securely and yet maintains easy use.  Cosemetically, it looks great with professional attire or with casual clothing!  The pockets inside work great for holding credit cards or business cards!  This is an excellent product
Extremely difficult to unistall. Endless loop. Do NOT buy this product or if you do then be prepared for an exremely fustrating experience. I will never use NAV again
      This book, "The Relatives Came" by Cynthia Rylant and illustrated by Stephen Gammell, was a delight to read. I found myself smiling as I read the words that made the artwork come alive. Likewise, I found myself recollecting over the memories of the past when my relatives would come to visit. And, I felt as if I, too, were a part of this book. Having experienced growing up in a small town where you don`t see that many people, I believe that when relatives come to visit, it almost seems like Christmas. As a result, when the book expressed the joy, laughter, and celebration of family, it stirred up these memories of the past. Unquestionably, almost anyone, from children to adults, could find themselves reminiscing and longing for the fun they had when their relatives come to visit.
Terribly waxy chocolate pieces that all sunk to the bottom of the bowl while the flakes floated on top.  The flakes seem to have a chocolate flavoring added to enhance the experience but those disgusting chocolate pieces made me gag and I wondered what I was eating...!

Don't get me wrong these are nice high end shoes, however, I was sent an ugly red color instead of the yellow displayed on the products site. Nowhere on the products site was the (red) "Outdoor Plein Air" color shown as a choice
My ONLY gripe with this magazine is that the pictures are like those you would find in GQ magazine: they hire models to show you driving a nail or shoveling dirt for that new patio.  These people use only brand new tools (brand name label showing of course) in a perfect-world dust free environment.  The pictures make it look like it's a Sears catalogue. ---  --- Aside from that, the articles are great making it one of the best magazines for the do-it-yourselfer.  I have saved more money from the tips in this magazine than any other magazine I subscribe to.  Most articles can be done by any semi-skilled craftsman with access to a decent set of tools, making it an approachable magazine for the DIY'er. ---  --- I highly recedommend this magazine in conjunction with Fine Homebuilding magazine.  In that magazine you will find that the pictures are of real people operating used tools in a real environment.  The articles in Handyman are a bit more down-to-Earth, but together you will get the most benefit
I bought this item thinking I was getting a healthy snack. The fruit is soaked in high fructose corn syrup, and it is extremely sweet. Not health
With a good script and a director better suited to the material (I've read Pedro Almodovar expressed interest in adapting the novel and Jonathan Demme was originally attached to direct), Asylum could have been a superb exploration of romantic obsession and a great showcase for star Natasha Richardson.  Unfortunately, the film poorly tries to condense too much plot and things happen so fast that the film fails to fully explore the psychology of its characters in cinematic terms... a pretty major flaw for a movie that is supposed to be an exploration of the psychological effects of sexual obsession. ---  --- The basic plot concerns the affair between the bored psychiatrist's wife (an excellent Natasha Richardson) and one of the asylum's patients (an equally good Marton Csokas), under the watchful eye of the patient's doctor (Ian McKellen).  There are several plot twists in the last part of the movie, some of which seem quite preposterous, at least in the way the movie was shot.   ---  --- The only reason to watch this movie is to see Natasha Richardson.  She does her best in spite of the choppy script, and she even won a Best Actress award in London for this film.  However, as a psychological thriller or an exploration of sexual repression and obsession, director David Mackenzie has done an extremely sloppy job.  (In fact, I remember that in the promotional interviews Richardson, credited as an executive producer, sounded very disappointed about the way the movie turned out.
Abel's Island is about a mouse named Abel.  He encounters a hurricane that separates him from his wife.  After the storm, he ends up on an island where he cannot escape because of the current surrounding the island.  He tries many ways to return to the place he loves, but all fail.  About a year after countless attempts to leave the island, a frog appears by accident. Gover, the frog, becomes friends with Abel and says he will come back with people to help Abel.  Abel's plans to return were very interesting.  His methods were very creative so it held my attention.  My favorite part was when he was fighting the owl.  I found a similarity between Abel and Stuart Little. Both had to navigate water. Stuart little was successful, but was Abel?  Read the book to find out.  
I received this magazine as a gift... and I will not renew. Articles are very short and refer you to websites, telephone numbers, etc. for more information. Why so little information in the magazine itself? --- Additionally, there is a load of advertising: take that out of the equation and the magazine would only be a few pages long. --- For my money, there is much more available elsewhere, including a "google" search. Waste of paper, IMHO
As popular as Prince was in the 80's, it's hard to believe it has taken 18 years for Under The Cherry Moon to find it's way to DVD.  Critics largely considered the film a stinker, especially considering it was only two years behind Purple Rain, but Under The Cherry Moon was a very good film, although very different than Purple Rain.  Shot in black and white, Under The Cherry Moon starred Prince as Christopher Tracey, him and his buddy Tricky (Jerome Benton from The Time) are living it up in Europe.  They wine and dine the rich and upper class and take their money, basically they are gigolos.  They swear it never gets personal until Mary Sharon comes into the picture.  Christopher falls for Mary in a big way, but her father Issac Sharon isn't having it.  Drama ensues. The soundtrack is awesome and includes the songs "U Need Another Lover Like You Need a Whole In Your Head," "Mountain," and "Kiss" and the DVD includes the videos for the songs shot for the film.  A must have for Prince fans.
If you read the label on this stuff it says 100% sucrose and that is what this stuff is plain and simple sugar. You're basically paying $10 dollars for something you could get at a grocery store for $1.50. This is a rip off! There is nothing special about this stuff in terms of size color everything!!! Just buy sugar!!!!!
This was an amazing read. I couldn't put it down. ---  --- If you like CSI, then you will love this books. The forensics are very interesting.  ---  --- You would never guess who the killer is! I was totally shocked when I got to the end
The retail price is totally wrong. I could get it for cheaper from another vendor
I purchase my unit a little less than one year ago and now I am shopping for a different brand.  It worked fine for the first summer season in Texas, but now that it is spring almost summer--it does not turn on at all.  I have completed all of the manual's troubleshooting in addition to purchasing a new bulb and cable for it.  But, it does not work anymore after only 1 summer usage!  I do not recommend!!
I liked this product so much-I'm buying some for my family members who live out of town!  Only a small amount leaves my hair feeling soft, shiny and moisturized.  And it's great on my ends-especially with roller sets! Plus, my darling hubby loves the scent. I use it along with the Khoret Amen Hair Oil

I bought two Clarisonic brushes - one as a gift and one for myself.  Although the product works well, unfortunately, both brushes were defective.  The trouble started occurring about two months after using.  One brush started out with two speed settings, but eventually only functioned at the low setting.  The other brush started turning on by itself and eventually could not be recharged! ---  --- My experience with the customer service has been terrible.  They would not replace my brush for me even though the product was still under warranty.  Be careful if you are going to travel abroad.  The warranty on the brush is nulled if you use the brush in a power outlet other than 110v!  
The software was installed flawlessly.  Programs have worked successfully and been exactly what i need and wanted
In the days where people play games to shoot random people and other stuff...It's nice to know there's still art in videogames. I loved this game. My brother heard about it and I rented it soon after. Wow... --- Graphics: 10/10 Lovely, LOVELY, BEAUTIFUL! Enough said --- Sound: 20/10 Music is so pretty. I love the orchestral going on. --- Story: 7/10 The average, "Save the princess" game... --- Controls: 8/10 Hard to deal with the horse. Easy when walking --- Overall: 9/10 This is a beautiful game but it's upsetting it's so short. I can easily say this game introduced me into full-on puzzle games. --- It does have something to do with Ico but no one really knows if it's a prequel, a sequel or anything..
I just recently bought this and when I installed it Norton caught 2 viruses on the install CD.
This pillow works! Sleeping in the car used to make my son cranky  --- becausehis head would painfully drop to his chest making him fuss & cry.  Now with this comfy pillow, he naps peacefully & wakes up happy
this product works great for bodywash but is much too thick to be a shampoo
I just received a first-time correspondence from Kids Discover threatening referral to a credit agency for copies of a magazine that we didn't order and haven't received.  There is no telephone number to call and only a p.o. box to correspond with.  I suspect many people just pay the bill in order to avoid any trouble.  I sent a notice to the Consomer Complaint agency in the states involved in order to get this fraud on record
I am a huge fan of world war 2 first person shooters. I've been with the genre since the begining of medal of honor. since then, not too much has been more impresive to me than call of duty. It was a wonderfual game and still is. Call of Duty 2 was even better. Does this new game maintain the stellar streak the series is on? in a word, yes. Although, it is alot more of the same. But then again, why mess with a great formula? Call of Duty 3 works because it is exactly what the original game was built around, sheer intensity....and also alot of fun. But then you might say, well i've played COD2, are you saying its the same? Yes and No. The basic mechanics are the same and the few newly added gameplay elements do little to nothing for the overall game so in escense. Yea, its the same game. But this time around the levels are bigger and look o so much prettier. Honestly, these are some of the most amazing visuals on the xbox 360. I dare say it puts my beloved COD2 to near shame. The lighting and texturing is beautiful and the explosions are heart stopping to behold. The life like graphics are complimented by a brilliant musical score. Oh, and if anyone should wonder about the ingame soundeffects, just pop in a previous call of duty game and imagine it amped up even more. Seriously, the battlechatter has never been so nicely integrated. COD3 is yet another amazing world war 2 game that will certainly keep veterans of the genre happy and content, meaning on the edge of your seat. The newly implimented rag doll physics and destructable enviroments will make sure you stay there too. I reccomend this game to anyone and everyone who has played a world war two first person shooter and enjoyed it because what we have here ladies and gentelmen is the latest and greatest, the best that money can buy
This Bobber Cooler is definitely a conversation piece.  I have had so many comments about it. I used it when floating down a small river near home (No Rapids, just calm water), it doesn't hold its weight, literally. The first thing is that the opening is in the center of the cooler, making it impossible to get drinks out with out pulling the whole cooler out of the water.  The opening seam rides just barely about the water, and since it is round the weight shifts a little and the seam will dip into the water. The cooler then fills up with water, which almost immediatly melts the ice, and as it fills up it will sink to the bottom.  maybe if there was a rubber gasket to seal it better, it might be ok.  The 2 plastic clasps on each side used to close the cooler are really easy to break off, plus they are facing the wrong direction. If you bump something like a rock or a log, it will push the clasp back and then unlatch the cooler. ---  --- This cooler might be good to use in bodys of water that do not have current, like a pool, but I don't suggest towing it behind anything.  I suggest using one of the many inflateble coolers on the market
This small package of noodles came to me in a huge box, which I thought was a huge waste and completely unnessecary.  And, when I opened the box, a small melted ice pack failed to keep the noodles cold, so they were hot and smelled terrible.  I had to throw them in the trash outside right away because of the smell, and called Gristedes and left an upset, yet polite message.  It has been almost a week and I have not heard from them.  Don't waste your money on this supposedly "great deal."  It's not worth it
I expected this to be dry and mechanical like lots of other math texts - too-technical proofs, homework questions irrelevant to the material, insufficient explanations for why things are the way they are. This book really surprised me because it wasn't "mathy" at all. It doesn't just throw proofs at you expecting you to wade thru page upon page of math notation until you understand - it gives you the intuitive side of important concepts, which means you only need common sense, not an intensive mathematical background to get everything. The examples they picked simplify rather than confuse the concepts. Each easily and naturally leads to the next. If there's anything not thoroughly elaborated, they were sure to cover it in the homework questions, by gently prodding the reader along towards the answer step by step instead of smacking them in the face with impossible problems. Homework questions supplement the material perfectly and basically leave you with a full and well-rounded impression of what the concepts mean as well as when and why to use them, not just how to plug numbers into some formula. --- If anything, I'd say this book errs on the side of caution in that in some sections it could pick up the pace a little. But then again, you could always just skip the easier parts
Whether you are diabetic, eating low carb, or just want great pasta, this product is perfect in every way.  I have served dreamfields pasta to over twenty people, told them I was trying a new brand of pasta, and asked them what they thought.  Every last person said it was wonderful, and not one person guessed that it was not "regular" pasta.  Most said it was better than the pasta they use.  Try it...you'll love it
This salve is just perfect under Bliss's Softening socks. It's amazing how much you can smear on, leave on with the socks for at least half an hour and have all those great softening agents completely absorbed when you take off the socks. It leaves feet renewed. Use it once or twice a week to tame tough tootsies
We bought this tubside seat just today and tried it out for the first time with our baby, who is 5.5 months old and just sitting up on his own.   ---  --- Initially it looked great, seemed very sturdy and we thought he would love being able to sit and play with his toys.  However, getting him in and out we noticed that the plastic edges around where his legs go is actually very sharp, and as our baby is on the tall end of the spectrum, it was impossible to get him in and out of the seat without scraping up his little legs and knees.  ---  --- It's not as if he is going to get any shorter, so I don't think there is any solution to the problem.  I think Safety 1st could have done a better job of making the plastic in that area more comfortable, or even put some padding at that location.  I'm surprised more reviewers didn't have this problem.  For our baby, who normally loves bathtime, it was a painful and frightening experience. ---  --- We will be returning the item.  Since you can't leave your baby unattended in water anyway, we might as well just get a non-slip mat and hold him until he gains more balance.  I recommend you save your money on this one
I've been using Norton Antivirus 2002 with annual updates of patches forever with Norton Internet Security 2003. Now that it's time to renewal Norton Antivirus, I thought I switch to Trend Micro Internet Secuirty 2005 after all the glowing wins it received from certain mainstream computer magazines. I like Norton 2002 but it was a memory resident hog in the TaskManager considering I was running a P3 500 laptop with 196MB on WinXP Pro, resources are valuable. Also newer Norton Antivirus version were a hit and miss.  After also reading reviews at Amazon, I took the plunge with Trend Micro. My review of this product can be best summarize along with it's relations to Norton Antivirus 2002 (updated). ---  --- Pros of Trend Micro 2005: --- 1. Fastest virus scan I've seen. I have not find any virus in my system yet whereas Norton would fail in about .01% of the time( i.e. one stalling virus every year). --- 2. Check incoming and outgoing mail like Norton --- 3. Scan selected files as I chose just like Norton --- 4. Alert and Block virus threats --- 5. Monitor nearby Wifi connection --- 6. $25 mail in rebate making the price net at $15. (It's been 2 months since I've mailed it and not received it yet). --- 7. Uses about 10MB of system background resources versus Norton's 30MB. ---  --- Cons against Trend Micro 2005: --- 1. Very annoying  auto-virus update every day that I log on the internet. I only have a 56k connection and updating takes 5 minutes. I'm not trying to save the internet but everyday update may be a bit too much so I would prefer to have a preference setting that I can choose myself. Norton is not as annoying. ---  --- 2. On a wifi network, Trend Micro Firewall failed 5 of the Gibson research Shields Up test. Ports were open. Norton Internet Firewall close all major holes except for the non-critical ones which wasn't a big worry. I ended up disabling Trend Micro Firewall and using the Norton Firewall instead as it's a full software and much better analysis and deeper protection. ---  --- 3. Anti-spam and data protection were subpar as I got advertisements and  pop-up from certain websites like West Cost major newspaper. Using Norton Firewall stops them dead; never seen them again. ---  --- 4. Still waiting for rebate. ---  --- Overall, I think using TrendMicro Internet Security 2005 for it's fast virus check and a separate Norton Internet Firewall is the ideal combo for me. On it's own merit, Trend Micro would be perfect only if RAM and other resources are low as the case with my laptop but I wouldn't mind using Norton if I had plentiful more RAM. ---  
First of all, it's sad that someone would put out a product (the 360) that gets so hot that it tends to fry itself, unless you spend another 10% of the product cost on a little series of fans. ---  --- Second, I attached this. I plugged it in. It wouldn't even turn on. Waste of money. Do yourself a favor and just keep your machine in an open, uncluttered, unblocked area. If you absolutely must provide additional airflow, just point a $10 clip-on fan at it
I ordered this items in size xx-large for my 20 months doughter and there are huge. Maybe will fit when she will be 4 or 5, although she looks normaly for her age
Recently decided to purchase the Treo 750, but after ordering Amazon sends shipping info and it won't arrive for about a month and a half!  I cancelled and went to Cingular and purchased for a lesser price and had it in my hands immediately.  Sad...
This Games Story Takes Place Before GTA 3 So It's Sort Of Like A Prequal Set In Liberty City Compared To The Original It Looks A Lot Better Plus They Added Bikes And Motor Cycles And Attempted To Improve The Targeting By Using The Targeting System From San Andreas I Hate The Targeting But Being Able Target Manually Is A Good Thing If You Don't Own A Psp I'd Suggest Getting This Game But If You Do And Played It On That System There Really Isn't Any Point To Buying This Game Unless You Really Really Love GTA
Clever and stylish design; a lot of colors to choose from; and an excellent performance, best sport shoe eve
This review is about the Oral-B Flexisoft replacement heads. Coupled with the Braun electric toothbrushes, this is one of the most effective aids to oral hygiene ever developed. My introduction to Oral-B goes back over 27 years to a USAF basic training briefing; a dental technician held up an Oral-B toothbrush with medium bristles and said "this is the toothbrush you need if you want to keep your teeth" or some such statement like that. Well, I haven't lost one yet.  ---  --- The motorized mechanicals of the toothbrush do most of the work while you guide the oscillating round head around and over your pearly whites. While the heads are undeniably pricey when looked at just in dollars and cents, there is value in the fact that the total package actually makes a rather mundane chore a little more fun while actually living up to the claim that it does a better job on your teeth than manual brushing.  ---  --- Since I've always believed the entire surface area of the toothbrush head was meant to be covered with toothpaste and the size of the head on these is smaller than the average brush, I know I'm using less toothpaste to do the same job. While this is no big deal, the long term economic benefit is plaque under control, healthy gums and a bright smile full of natural teeth. It's kind of hard to deny it works since my dentist has confirmed the positive results upon direct examination. ---  --- Just be careful what model of these brush heads you are selecting and watch the pricing. Oral-B uses a kind of color code for the bristles, and the ones that have the colored indicator bristles in a line with the shaft are the Flexisoft model that seems to equate to medium hardness.  ---  --- Enjoy life
It took a while to get this product but, it was worth the wait. The iron heats up quickly and easily. When you have arthritis like me, you appreciate the simplicities in this product. It heated up fast and safely AND it was so easy to grip the handle. It definitely styled my hair without over-processing it. Thanks
Once I figured this software out, I was able to do a slideshow of my pictures, integrate video, and produce a decent DVD.  Only problem is, it distorts all my video footage by forcing it into 4:3 whereas my DVD camcorder shoots in 16:9.  This sucks.  I have been buying other software packages ever since trying to get my video to stay in 16:9.  Roxio support did e-mail me back with the blanket statement that it doesn't support 16:9 at this time.  Even in the new 7.5 version.  Roxio needs to join the rest of us in 2005 and bring their software to be compatible in widescreen
One of the best Doobie collections out there "Greatest Hits" lives up to its name focusing on the singles the band recorded and that charted in their long career. Some of the songs here are the single versions (meaning they were edited and are shorter than the album versions)and this might be a problem for some fans as they may want the full length versions of songs. Maybe it's because they were trying to squeeze more music onto the CD. Either way fans may want to be aware of that. ---  --- In fact even on the boxed set we get "Listen to the Music", "Nobody" and "Rockin' Down the Highway" in their single incarnations. Perhaps its because that was the way fans originally heard them on the radio. Either way, fans looking for the full length versions of these songs would do well to pick up one of the import "Greatest Hits" collections or wait for the remastered CDs coming out later this year. This set does have one track not on the boxed set--"Without You" a great rocker. The CD booklet is exactly like the larger booklet that comes with the boxed set just laid out a bit differently. ---  --- This definitely covers the highlights of the band's career whether it be the Tom Johnston rockin' years, Michael McDonald's blue-eyed soul stage or the band's reunion phase this has a bit of it all.  Personally, I would love to see a two disc distillation of the band's "Greatest Hits" with a second disc of album tracks such as "I Cheat the Hangman", "Losin' End", "The Captain and Me" and "How Do the Fools Survive?". In the meantime this single disc compilation will have to do for most fans.  ---  --- The sound is terrific pulling from the remasters produced by Bill Inglot for the boxed set. Detail and clarity is remarkable and puts the previously issued "Best of" pair to shame. This is the only place to get their singles from their first in 1970 "Nobody" to their last (when this compilation was put togetherin 2001) "Dangerous" released in 1991.   --- 
Carson McCullers, one of America's greatest Southern writers, was often misunderstood, as many people were put off by or unwilling to  deal with her (at the time) controversial subject matter. MCCullers used the grotesque as exaggerated symbols of everyday experience. The loneliness and isolation of her gothic-like characters were merely extreme examples of feelings we all have, though magnified and intensified to the nth degree. ---  --- Tennessee Williams, in his introduction to MCCullers' "Reflections in a Golden Eye", posed the question (in a mock dialogue) most people asked about writers of the 'gothic' school such as Carson McCullers, Flannery O'Connor, Katherine Anne Porter and Eudora Welty: "Why do they write about such dreadful things?" Williams replies, " In my opinion it is most simply definable as a sense, an intuition of an underlying dreadfulness in modern society.. Why have they got to use..symbols of the grotesque and the violent? Because a book is short and a man's life is long... The awfulness has to be compressed."  ---  --- McCullers, unlike any writer I have ever read, pierces the heart of themes such as love, isolation, and loneliness with her lucid, poetic prose. Tennessee Williams, in Virginia Spencer Carr's biography of McCullers summed up McCullers' writing as follows: "I have used the word 'heart', but it is not an adequate word to describe the core of Carson McCullers' genius....I believe, in fact I know, that there are many, many with heart who lack the need or gift to express it. And therefore Carson McCullers is what I would call a necessary writer: She owned the heart and the deep understanding of it, but in addition she had that 'tongue of angels' that gave her power to sing of it, to make of it an anthem.
If you have had any exposure to good literature, you will find this novel nearly insufferable. The symbolism is cliche, narrative style predictable and unoriginal, and the book as a whole is this woman's self-indulgent notion that the story of her family makes a good read. If she had any creative ability, she could use her family history as a starting point, but she does very little to distinguish her writing as exciting and fresh. Dull, dry, predicatable, callow, and unfortuantly a requirement from a lit professor who has insulted my eight semesters as an English student
If you are not a literature professor or don't read everything that the library gets in, you will probably find this game extremely difficult. On the other hand, you now have a book list
Why? ---  --- Why waste your time and money on producing crap? ---  --- Sony execs must be out of their minds. The Ghostbuster fans have been waiting years, and writing countless petitions to get the episodes on DVD, and this is what they come up with? ---  --- No. Give us season DVDs. Give us a 140 episode box set. Give us something. Not 4 non-sequential episodes on a disc that can hold MANY times that. ---  --- What a waste. This product gets 1 star because, apparently, you can't give it zero
Each time you replace the battery you have to reload all of your data.  Don't waste your money on this one
After three weeks my brush broke too!  Cannot find a replacement, I do not want to buy a whole new rack.  Design fault that they should correct.  Not good enoug
These were a little smaller than expected so if you have really big hands look to see if you can get a bigger size.  A little tight at the wrists, but these have great padding and serve me well
[...]The mouse is larger than needed and lighter than the average mouse.  I have dual screens and need an extra accurate mouse.  This is NOT it.  Unfortunately with this one, the sensor doesn't stand still.  My screensaver hardly ever turns on because when the mouse is just sitting there, the arrow jumps in all directions about 2-3 arrow spaces around.  Don't be fulled by the laser technology in this particular mouse.  My old optical was better. 
I was unsure if this product would be as good as the one sold at Brookstone.  It is great!  Just as good as the iJoy sold at Brookstone, but much cheaper.  I love it
Whoever is marketing this should be whipped with razor wire. Do not buy, unless you enjoy wasting your money
I shoot with a Canon 20D and have used the Canon EF 75-300mm f/4.5-5.6 III USM lens. I've always noticed the limitations of this lens when shooting amateur softball. I reviewed the lens lineup at the Canon website and decided on the Canon EF 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6L USM Lens. The 100-400mm is a great lens, but it can be a bit soft.  For that reason I decided to add the Canon EF 70-200mm 2.8/f IS USM telephoto zoom lens to my lens collection.  ---  --- This is a serious lens meant for serious photographers. Being an L lens, there is a lot of features and is manufactured with better materials with a high level of dust and moisture resistance. The construction is sturdy and consists of 23 elements in 18 groups.  The four Super UD-glass elements largely eliminate the secondary spectrum reducing residual chromatic aberration. An improved 8-blade circular aperture offers a more pleasing out-of-focus image.  The Canon EF 70-200mm lens weighs in at about 3.24 lbs/1,470 g, and accepts 77mm filters with a minimal focusing distance of 4.3 ft/1.3 m.  This lens is compatible with the extenders 1.4x II and 2x II.  Be sure to get a good quality UV haze filter to protect the front lens element. ---  --- Being white, this lens looks a bit strange, but helps keep it stay cool when shooting in the sun. Some people are concerned that being white, it attracts attention to criminals. From my experience, my 20D attracts attention regardless of what lens I put on it. In addition, I most likely have a camera bag and tripod/monopod with me to further attract attention.  I personally doubt a thief looking for something to steal is taking the time to evaluate the cost of the item and are more concerned with the ease of taking something they can unload. I try to make things difficult for would be thieves and have insurance as a back up.  ---  --- The dual IS system has two modes. Mode 1 is for stationary subjects while mode two is for moving subjects. It is recommended that the IS function is not used on a tripod; however I have used it on my monopod with success. The IS helps to eliminate camera shake and helps stabilize the lens when shooting from a moving vehicle. While there are limitations to what the IS can do, it can give you a few extra stops. Just keep in mind, the IS attempts to eliminate camera movement, not the movement of the subject being photographed.  ---  --- This lens permits for auto or manual focus depending on how the switch is set. There is also a switch to shift from a 1.4m/4.6ft to infinity or 2.5m/8.2ft to infinity.  ---  --- Included with this lens are the Tripod mount, lens hood, and storage case. The tripod mount is the best option to use when mounting to a tripod. This helps to balance the load. Mounting the camera instead creates an unbalanced set up that may topple over. The case is a zippered soft case (LZ1324) that can also be purchased separately. The lens hood (ET-86) is used to reduce lens flare and can protect the front element in certain situations.  Often times, Amazon recommends purchasing the lens case and hood, however they are normally included with the lens. ---  --- The Canon EF 70-200mm is such an awesome lens, it almost fails to compare to the Canon EF 75-300mm.  The Canon 100-400mm lens is a well used option for me, but the clarity and sharpness of the 70-200mm IS lens is more refined. The auto-focus is quiet and quick. This lens can be used for portraits, landscape, sports or as a general walk about lens.  The f/2.8L combined with the IS makes this a good option for certain low light situations.  The features add creative versatility. The Canon EF 70-200mm IS lens comes at a price, but it is worth every bit of it.  ---  --- PROS:  --- Incredible clarity and sharpness  --- Quiet and quick auto-focus  --- Features add creative versatility  --- Dual IS system  ---  --- CONS:  --- Heavy and bulky (This should be expected with these types of lenses
I purchased this program about 1.5 years ago. I have been casually studying German through other programs for about 4 years. The best basic words-only is through Unforgettable Languages (very basic, but easy as heck to learn). Rosetta Stone is the best for understanding gender, verb usage and adapting to the German style of sentence structure. I absolutely love all the functionality and versatility of the program. It is incredibly challenging to go from reading to typing and to speaking.  --- The only negative is that the CD has to be used to run the program. Even with an accelerated CD-Rom, the starting/stopping of the CD is distracting. If that feature were corrected, it would be perfect
I personally do not see how this book could have won a Newbery medal. While the author portrays sibling rivalry effectively, that is about the only positive aspect of this book. The fact that the teenage girl protagonist has a crush on an elderly man is disgusting and is presented as not only being acceptable but understandable. Sara's family is also unsupportive to her sulky and jealous attitudes. Her grandmother is a busybody and consantly antagonizes the family. Sara's twin sister gets all the attention and love, leaving Sara starving for parental care. Finally, Christianity is portrayed as harsh and judgemental. This book could possibly be acceptable for adults but never for children and I would not recommend it to anyone. I wasted my time with this book: please don't waste yours.
My daughter was having horrible gas pains and we tried everything under the sun to help her out.  Then, we switched to these bottles and it worked like magic.  AMEN!  I don't care how many parts there are -- it is totally worth the sleep we are now getting
It does everything I hoped for and more!! As a new user of Acrobate, I am very definitely impressed... in part by the ease with which I am able to learn the program, as well as its functionality!
These are a big improvement over the porcelin ones.... The food seemed to cook faster and tasted better... They were heavier than I thought they would be and was a perfect fit for my Silver B.
My husband, a non-celiac, eat this pancake mix (to make waffles) all the time.  The recipe calls for egg whites to be beaten until stiff, so it is a bit more work than many other mixes.  But, it is worth it!  The result tastes like *real* waffles.  Kinnikinnick mix also makes good tasting waffles, but the texture isn't as nice
The Equus 3130 is a fantastic product!  It does all I need...and at a very affordable price.  The Equus website is functional and easy to navigate. ---  --- Amazon delivered as promised with FREE shipping...and I had a GREAT transaction.  Thanks
I received exactly what I ordered very quickly
I car camp around 6 weeks a year. Every night on a different spot. I was looking for a light and sturdy table. Easy to setup and easy to pack. This table is not the right table for me. Yes it's light. That's the only good atribute I can find for this table. It's cumbersome to setup. The plastic tabs that hold it together are very fragile. The end caps on the ribs of the top surface started falling off even before the table was assembled. It's low to the ground. I would not buy this table again, nor I would recommend anyone to buy it. I give it one star because I can't give it any lower. ---  --- Alvaro --- Sacramento, CA
The image showing for this spoon set is not correct. The image is for Bendable Spoon which used to feed the baby before 12 month old and the description for the image is for baby after 12 month old. When you place the order they send you the set of spoon and fork with metal end for feeding the toddler not the plastic one for feeding the infant
Unfortunately I had to return the unit because it was not designed to be used on a Mac 10.4 program( the tech at the company said he was not aware it was meant to be used by a Mac.
There are probably more authentic ways to make real BBQ, but nothing any easier.  If what you like about BBQ is the flavor, not the work, this unit is for you.  Add water to the pan, chips to holder, put some dry rubbed pork [...] on one (or all) of the four grates, light the gas and you are good to go.  It holds temperature very well unattended.  Adding more chips two additional times gives you all the smoke flavor you could want.  Your friends will think you are a genius
Dont waste your money on this one. the picture is cute. but the quailty of the toy isnt any good. the frosting doesnt even stay in the hole and the box is flimsy it would never last with a child. the concept is supposed to be like the game memory,your supposed to turn over the donuts and match the ones with the same frosting. your better off just buying the real memory game. the only thing this is good for is the pretend food concept and even with that it isnt worth this price.
 ---  I grew up reading Harold Evan's Sunday Times - in the late 1970s it provided a window on the world that few other papers could. I particularly remember comprehensive coverage of Egyptian President Sadats historic visit to Jerusalem; ongoing coverage of Soviet dissidents and a very welcome (I'm Irish) editorial urging Britain to consider withdrawal from Northern Ireland.  However, from today's perspective, the paper's foreign coverage seemed to be written from a point of view which could be summarised as `what would the world do without Henry Kissinger?' [Indeed this has always seemed to be Mr. Kissinger's view also]; and that Soviet unreasonableness was a product of American hawkish unreasonableness and that balance, compromise and reasonableness were achievable with enough negotiation.  My memory is of positive disdain for the emerging tax revolt in California and absolute dread at the more confrontational foreign policy approach being urged by followers of Governor Reagan.  A major positive for me was the explanatory diagrams and the furtively taken photographs of Soviet missiles (SS-20s?) being deployed in Russian forests.  I was reminded of these diagrams in 2002/3 when the modern Sunday Times gave excellent descriptions - supported by diagrams - of Saddam's mobile chemical/biological weapons labs - which turned out not to exist.    ---  In saying all the above, I mean both to pay tribute to Harold Evans and to put in context the criticisms I have of this book - which contains descriptions of his triumphs as Sunday Times editor and his difficulties as Times Editor under Rupert Murdoch.  The book has three sections - the first describes some of the episodes which made Evan's Sunday Times great - the investigative reports from the Insight team and others, of malicious cover-ups of poor quality in the pharmaceutical industry (Thalidomide) and the aircraft industry (McDonnell Douglas); the publication of the Crossman Diaries - laying bare the rivalries and mutual disdain of the members of the British Labour Cabinet.  Having established his credentials  as a `vertical' journalist - Evan's term, which he describes as `seeking to get to the bottom of things' - and lauding his proprietors, the Thomson's, for allowing him to do so, the second part of the book deals with the advent of Mr. Murdoch as owner.  The machinations of Murdoch to gain control are fascinating, the Thomson's were drained both financially and personally by the losses induced by union activity, and they secretly dealt with Murdoch while other offers were being pursued by the editors.  Murdoch eventually won ownership of both the Times and Sunday Times, having given guarantees of editorial freedom to a board of `national directors', guarantees, which if breached, were theoretically amenable to criminal legal sanction.  As part of the change of ownership Evans was offered the editorship of the Times - one of the free worlds most revered titles.   In his description of the paper, Evans reveals an almost po-faced reverence for the place of the Times as part of the British Establishment - he sees it as the paper of record, upholding fair, non-partisan and accurate journalism which British society has come to expect. One feature of this is his constant enumeration of people's educational background, almost every colleague is named and then his/her school and university are listed - for example Joe Smith, Winchester, Oxford, to establish both social class and academic (perhaps intellectual) credentials.  He documents the `four pillars' of the Times as its reporting of Parliament, its legal coverage, its obituaries and its leader columns.  Oh dear! Stolid stuff, from the fearless, vertical, investigative editor. Nonetheless this section contains fascinating accounts of Evan's new broom editorship coming to terms with the rather lazy attitude to scoops and freshness of news which, by implication, criticise his predecessor as editor (William Rees Mogg); and show that change was indeed necessary at the institution.  Looming behind this story is Murdoch's general management style - haphazard interventions, secretive finances and lack of budgeting and planning.  From the text it seems to me that Murdoch was overstretched with transatlantic acquisitions, rather than covertly scheming to undermine Evans.  ---  The third section of the book reads a bit like Macbeth - Murdoch plots to renege on his guarantees and to impose his will on the editors. The text here is well paced and descriptive - the tension plays havoc with everyone, save perhaps Murdoch, Evan's second-in-command betrays him, various functionaries within the paper either resign or become lackeys, the `national directors' turn out to be paper tigers (this is too good a pun to delete), the Thatcher government sides with Murdoch and fails to taken any action as the guarantees are broken, piecemeal.  The thrust of this section reveals Evans as tragic hero, valiantly striving to uphold freedom of speech against the devious, double-dealing Murdoch, whose lackeys live in fear of his disapproval.   However, by the time I got to this section I had, sadly, lost a lot of respect for Evan's impartiality, his defence of press freedom seemed to me to cloak an innate inability to face change in the form of new commercial and political realities.  This was reaffirmed in my mind when, on the day that Evan's agreed to reign, who should phone to commiserate but Henry Kissinger!  ---  In the end I think the book is important in that it is illustrates that one important feature of change and leadership is that they are neither comfortable nor, initially at least, popular.   Evans, though personally engaging - and I'm sure mercurial and demanding - came to represent a set of fading political beliefs. The change occurring at the times these events described were taking place saw the emergence of economic individualism unleashed by lowering taxation rates; the antipathy to organised labour and active military competition with the Soviet Union.   The fading, indeed failing, Social Democratic consensus was overthrown by a more individualistic and competitive set of beliefs and the process was quite ugly, given the sincerely held beliefs on both sides.  I believe Evans and Murdoch were representative shadows of this change.  The rest of the story - Evans attractive forthrightness, Murdoch's furtive acquisitiveness - while the human interest focus of the story, are ultimately a side show. ---  This book is well told, highly dramatic and engaging, however seen at a remove of twenty five years it is a lament from someone who worked hard to become part of an establishment whose day was done.
Magic looks very nice on DVD. Solid clean picture quality with original basic mono soundtrack. A pleasant suprise from Dark Sky Films
Beware of this camera! The camera overall works great. We have had it for more than a year now and it takes clear, bright pictures and is very easy to use.  Very nice compact size.   ---  --- However, as others have pointed out, the battery is the fatal flaw in this camera and we will be looking for a non-Elph replacement for fear we will run into the same problem again.  There is NO battery meter until it needs to be recharged or replaced.  We were warned about this so I thought, no problem, I'd get two batteries and be ready to switch them when charging was needed.  But what we found out is that the batteries themselves quickly retain less and less charge so that now, they last only a few minutes each before another charge is needed. I had previously thought that this problem of retaining less charge over time was only for the much older battery designs and am dismayed to find myself looking for another camera so soon.
I had this model, or at least it looked the same, for a few years and it worked exceptionally well.  It finally broke down recently and I thought I was lucky enough to find it again, but they must have changed the product significantly because it does not work very well at all.  Actually, it is virtually useless as it only partially gets the job done, which, of course is like not having it done at all
This is an excellent battery that powers my Canon 5D camera very well. Although I haven't tested it against the spec for how many shots I can get from it, I've been very impressed with the longevity of it's charge
I finally got a Snow Brum after living in the northeast my whole life.  I can't believe I've wasted so much time with a regualr snow brush.  And this is a required tool if you have an SUV and hate having 50 pounds of snow slide down your wind shield when ever you hit the brakes.  You can clean off your entire car in about 1/10th of the time.  And this is great for the deep snows too.  In short, if you have snow - YOU NEED THIS
Both the original order and the attempted re-order were missing the same parts (the plate that holds the weights on the end of the rope and the nut that holds the plate on the bolt at the end of the rope) when the item arrived.  I think that this is a design flaw in the packaging
Excellent product! I really appreciate the option to choose any of the 50 given mystery cases to solve. After playing all 50, you can just start all over again! Fun, fun, fun game! THANKS
I think when many say they knew after 15 minutes who the killer was, they're actually saying they guessed who the killer was and just happened to be right.  ---  --- Think about this for a moment: What was the motive? That was something I never figured out. The killer didn't have a motive. That's what threw me off. But I guess some would say a crazed killer doesn't need a motive. But come on! Even the deranged killer in 7even had a reason for killing. Even Norman Bates had a reason for killing. ---  --- It could be the reason was explained but I just missed it because the movie was so terrible. I don't know. I really don't want to have to watch the whole movie again to figure it out. ---  --- I know if you have a lot of high profile actors in secondary roles, one of them is the killer for sure; but you're thrown off by the fact that you have Andy Garcia, D.W. Moffett, and Sam L. Jackson. So all 3 are fair game
know you. You were me. Looking for what seemed to be a simple thing - a scented candle that ACTUALLY smells up the room when you light it. You've bought the cheap ones in the grocery store that sent out the weak scent of, well, grocery store. And some candles smell like spray room deodorizer which smells like what one would use in the toilet which then make you think of poop which is not at all what you were going for in the living room. So then you hit the expensive pretty versions - perhaps even in candle stores with cute waxy names. They are not candles, my friend. They are sculptures. Some fancy ones come with cute packaging and crispy dried flowers. This is when you lose your patience. I DO NOT WANT CRISPY DRIED FLOWERS. I WANT A CANDLE THAT PUMPS A GOOD SCENT ALL OVER A ROOM WHEN I LIGHT IT. ---  --- This is it. Votivo. You will walk into the room and that room will smell like the candle. The most universally loved scent is probably Red Currant. I also enjoy Rain. The little glass it comes in makes a cute vase after the candle is done. Plus, they make perfect last minute hostess gifts, as the box is very nice and expensive-looking. ---  --- So, Votivo isn't the cheapest candle in the world. They're still cheaper than buying a bunch of cheap candles that stink...weakly stink.
Really cute boots, but the back zipper made my heels feel as if they weren't supported, and about to slide out.  The 4" heels force your feet into a near ballerina toe pose and I had to take these off after half a day.  My next step is to try some insoles for them and maybe that will help
I bought these pods on Amazon because they were a dollar cheaper than at the local grocery store.  Now I know why.  When I opened the package the Senseo Watermark was faint or hardly visable and it took me 3x the amount of pods to make a decent cup of coffee.  Buyer beware,  I am back to buying pods at the grocery store. 
I purchased the Cyberpad 8.5x11 digital Notepad with the expectation that I would be able to digitize my sketches and notes I made at work. Unfortunately the product did not live up to my expectations. The first unit that I received did not function, the usb connection to the pad was defective (the connector would not insert all the way hone). I returned it and received very promptly a new unit which at least functioned. As far as being functional that is another story. I proceed to try to use the it in either using the memory in the pad itself or using it directly connected to the computer. Either way the unit produced images that were useless. The lines that look fine on the paper pad were incomplete or missing in the digital version. Drawing a straight line was impossible even with the help of a straight edge. I let a friend try to use it and he had similar unsatifactory results. Unless this performance is a function of this manufacturer's design, I would say that this is one technology that is not ready for 'Prime Time'
I am a Sci-Fi / Space geek so this movie seemed right up my alley.  The cast was solid, the director has talent, and the story is a true story so all pretty much went well...right?  Nope. ---  --- This was a pretty dull film with very little believable suspense. The formula kept repeating over and over: Something goes wrong + Houston advises + Astronauts do something = All is well.  Lather, rinse, repeat.  Boring, VERY boring. I never once flet any real tension except for the initial "problem" which obviously was not THAT bad because everything went well in the end.   ---  --- The problem is that all of the "issues" the men faced were handled so matter-of-factly.  Rarely did anyone seem rushed or panicked.... it was just yeah, attach this tube to this tube and magically everything will be OK.  I never felt that the astronauts were really threatened, maybe a few times, but only for a minute or two.  Some reviews claim that this movie was tense and riveting.... how so I must ask?  Nothing really happened.  It was not emotional at all since the "struggles" of the men were so poorly portrayed.  To each his own I guess, but 4 1/2 stars?  Geeez, just because Tom Hanks is in it does not make the movie good follks! ---  --- The family interactions were pretty standard: Crying wife, kids asking questions, annoying media attention, etc, etc.  Yeah, I could feel for the characters to some extent, but again, this movie needed a LOT more real tension and panic to be meaningful. ---  --- I will say that the launch scene was excellent and very cool, so were some of the space shots but even those were fake with noise and Star-Trekkish special effects. ---  --- Too bad, I had high hopes for this film but was completely disappointed and bored. ---  --- NOT recommended
It's thin, so you can wear something over it.  And it helps keep the chill out. ---  --- I wear it cycling and golfing
Meguiar's NXT Tech wax is easier to use than any other wax I've ever used, and it brings back the original color of my 2000 red Honda like no other as well.Buy it, use it, love it
I was extremly disappointed when I received this. It did not fit my phone and promptly was thrown into the garbage can. I had one of the first Razor phones and it did not fit. When I got th belt clip I went to CINGULAR to upgrade my phone to a newer version and brought the belt clip... that didn't fit either. I would no recommend this product to anyone, even if it does cost a dollar... with shipping cost it costs about $6.00
I've always been a Terri clark fan but this is the first cd I've purchased by her. I was surprised at how much I really enjoyed this cd! Terri has an amazing voice and the songs kept me listening to the cd over and over again
In the Golden Age of Hollywood, each studio usually took a stab all various genres, but excelled in only one. Warner Brothers cornered gangster films, with forays into musicals (Busby Berkeley) and noir (Bogart). Universal dabbled in lots of B-films, but succeeded big-time with horror. MGM, of course, produced the best musicals. Fox did melodramas --- especially noir --- with an occasional romp on MGM's musical turf. And usually those romps hit some really bad notes. Witness the first three flicks in their Marquee Musicals series. Daddy Long Legs has Astaire and Caron, Pin-Up Girl has Betty Grable, Week-End in Havana has Alice Faye and Carmen Miranda,  The memory of these films, for the most part, is a lot better than the films themselves. The pleasant but fairly pedestrian scores, thin plots and busy character actors scurrying around propping up the story make for rough going. And make one yearn for Mickey and Judy
As most of the other reviewers, I live in a small townhome.  This chair is wonderful.  It takes up very little space and is so easy to clean.  I remove the straps and throw them in the wash and they come out so clean.  The rest of the chair is very easy to wipe clean and the tray just gets put in the dishwasher.  Despite carrots, prunes, etc. being mashed into it, the tray hasn't stained at all.  I recommend this chair to all my pregnant friends
This was purchased as a gift for a duck hunter.  He had used other head lamps but absolutely loved this one for the brightness and accuracy of the light when he moves his head.  I would highly recommend this product
I am so happy they are selling this now outside the gift set.. I have never had a lip gloss that tastes and looks and feels as great as this does! I have Amber and Dolly and plan to try a few other of the colors as its the best I have ever tried!
Klear screen has to be the absolute worst product I've ever used.  It has nearly ruined my 2001fp.  I was stupid and used it on my primary display first, instead of using the 50/50 isopropyl alcohol/water mix that's far superior to klear screen products.  My LCD now has cloudy areas and streaks that simply will not come out.   My 3 year old laptop's display looks nearly perfect because I only used the 50/50 solution on it, my 2001fp looks horrible now. 
This is a great game for any skilled star wars game freak. The graphics are pretty good and the gameplay is very fun and challenging don't listen to the negative reviews claiming the game is to hard, the people who claim it's to hard are just weak at video games granted the game can frustrate but it never get's to the point where you want to throw the game out the window. This is a good game and I highly recomend it to and star wars fan. p.s. don't buy jedi academy that game is horrible! what a shame to ruin the series like that
The book contained more profanity than I expected to read in a book by Rita Rudner.  I had expected more humor from a comedienne.  Too bad, because I really like her humor
At the young age of 25 Julie Barenson loses her husband. Shortly after he dies, a great dane puppy is delivered to her home with a note from her late husband. This part will give you the chills ... nice touch.  She names him Singer, and despite her frustrations with his size and clumsy mannerisms they grow to love each other.   After a few years of trying to get her life back together after her tragic loss, Julie begins dating 2 men--Richard, a handsome charmer who wines & dines her, brings her lavish gifts and professes his undying love very early in the relationship. The other, Mike, is a simple down to earth country type whose idea of a date is a burger, Doritos & a couple beers at the local watering hole.  So who would you choose? Ouch! I'll stop there with the comment that this could have been such a compelling story.  Instead, we are faced with trite, boring, repetitive dialogue throughout, scatterings of viewpoint shifts and a very predictible plot.  I cannot believe this is the same author who wrote The Notebook, one of my all time favorite novels. I'll have to admit the ending brought on a gush of tears.  In conclusion, Singer not only saved his owner but the book as well.
I bought this for my grandson for Christmas, he was 8 months old. This has been the best learning toy for him, along with entertainment. He has learned how the shapes work and took this on soon. It has also helped him in walking. It is entertaining for me to watch him play with this toy, he has to push the button and play the music before he pushes it. I would actually buy one more for him to have at home with Mom and Dad. This is well worth the money
I was quite pleased with this alarm clock until recently when I found that it was consistently waking me up one hour early.  I tried fiddling with the DST setting and then changing the alarm and clock times just a little but without fail it would wake me an hour earlier than I wanted.  The brightness may be a problem for some people but I found it reasonable.  Overall a good docking station, but a poor alarm clock
The first time I read this book, I was watching it all happen. i'ts like I was invisible. I admire Elizabeth for having the guts to do what she did. I would have fought back, but she did it the safe way, she didn't resist. Reading this book, you feel like you know the Smart family. I pray for all Missing Children everywhere. Elizabeth is the luckiest girl in the world! Mary Katharine was so cool and collected. she is amazing too. read this book
This has the perfect blend of sweet and salty combination without the guilt
On the whole, Bicycling is a huge disappointment. I agree with some writers that the occassional tidbits of information are good, but I don't pay for a subscription for a sidebar or two -- I read those in the newstand. Further, as I will mention below, once and a while there is a real gem of an article. ---  --- In the meantime, almost everything else they do is poor. The entire magazine is pitched at the readership as though we were all budding pros, training obsessively and fighting with that last 1% of body fat. The reality is, what Bicycling's readership principally is is rich -- in their own pages, they recently listed average household income of a subscription at $115,000. So it's not people with the ability tor ride like the pros ride, it's people with the ability to buy what the pros ride. ---  --- The result is a majority of articles and reviews that focus on just this -- $3000+ bikes (and, as one reviewer said, the occassional review of more reasonably priced choices around $1500. Wait, $1500 is *not* chump change?!?!), advanced training and eating techniques, etc., as opposed to real world riding -- centuries and club rides, touring, commuting (gasp!), etc. Even it's racing coverage is terrible -- its recent spread on the San Fran GP, one of the three most important races in the US, was 6 pages of photos, 4 of which were of people watching the race, not the racing itself. ---  --- For me, though, the worst part is its hypocrisy. In a recent issue, there was a truly excellent article on what the author called "Invisible Riders" -- low income laborers who depended on their cheap bicycles to get them to and from work sites everyday. Yet: the author mentioned several times (albeit with embarrassment) that he was riding a Seven while doing research on people whose lives depended on $100 bikes; the author commented on the significance of these riders commuting everyday, a movement which riders like Bicycling readers had never been able to mobilize (maybe because they all drive to work and the magazine does little or nothing to encourage bicycle commuting); and the five bikes reviewed in that issue ranged from $3500-$7000. ---  --- Really, really sad. One star for "Invisible Riders" and the like, and that's it
After a promising start, Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy's 1944 effort plunges into a sea of MGM mediocrity with a ludicrous plot involving the attempted murder of a boy king. However, Chef Ollie's "Steak a la Oliver" is worth a few laughs
I looked through this book at a craft store the other day, and as a person who loves the ocean and seashells, I found maybe one project in here that I would consider making.  Just about every project uses a ridiculous amount of shells so imagine the cost would be prohibitive and for this reason projects look overly ornate.  Unless that is the look you are seeking to accomplish, I wouldn't recommend this book.  Try to find "Decorating with Seashells" by Anita Louise Cran
My youngest brother, who has a pretty strange sense of humor, bought me this CD for my birthday; I wonder how he knew I didn't own it already? I don't even know where to begin with this one. What can you say about somebody who poses for an album cover in rainbow-painted panties while licking a heart-shaped lolli-pop? And the foldout poster of her reclining on pink satin sheets with said lolli-pop is downright laughable. Does she expect anyone to take her seriously? After her first album, I thought Carey had a remarkable talent that needed some fine-tuning, particularly in regard to her penchant for singing cliches. Instead of getting better, though, she has turned her career into a self-debasing fantasy of baby-doll mannerisms coupled with relentlessly monotonous song choices. Rappers like Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg, Missy Elliott and Usher are brought in to add spice, but they only drown in the sticky-sweet syrup of gunk that she chooses to sing. She may have a lot of #1 hits, but who can tell any of them apart? Rainbow is only Carey's latest entry in a career that has lowered the quality standard for divas everywhere.  ---  D-  Tom Rya
Ok, I've listened to Fat Boy Slim.  That guy's stuff isn't bad, by no means main stream, but worth while.  But ... this Norman Cook - he's horrible.  It's no wonder Cook developed an alter ego.  With the exception of a few easily recognisable tunes, I couldn't believe this "stuff" had come from the same artist that produced Praise You.  Renegade Master is the type of track I've come to know and respect (that one is a keeper), and I have to give props for I Left My Wallet in El Segundo.  Other than that, this album sounds like someone mixed songs from the first dozen records they found during their expedition to the flea market.  If this is the sound you're looking for, save a few bucks, check out your local yard sales.  So as not to be too negative, I'll say this; the printing job on the CD itself is charming.  The notion of making it look like a turntable was inspired
The pliers do the job & seem to be well made. My only problem was the awkwardness in trying to align the link. I guess if you remove the band from the watch, it would make it easier. In that case I recommend one of the pin removers that sit flat on a horizontal surface. BUT...this did do the job (even leaving the band on the watch). It comes with a smaller sized push pin that is a breeze to swap out
to set the record straight, rodney 'darkchild' jerkins produced ONE song on this album, and that is 'he said'. ---  --- that said, producer waryn 'baby dubb' campbell [also husband of erika, younger of the duo] did a great job on this album.  not at all to say that the ladies' singing hasn't always been phenomenal. ---  --- the highlights of this album include the aforementioned darkchild song, a guest apperance by fred hammond on 'this love' [their appearance on his album, speak those things' is duly noted], an impressively done cover of stevie wonder's 'you will know', and a cover of walter hawkins' 'thank you'.  yes, that is the original sampled at the end of the song. ---  --- every album that mary mary has released to this day [yes, all two of them] has proven that gospel music can be musically current-- impressive-- and still within taste.  that's what happens when you have the best on your team... ---  --- baby dubb, while being mary mary's resident producer can also be found on kierra sheard's 'let go', 'sweetest thing', 'all i am', fred hammond's albums 'speak those things' and 'somethin' 'bout love' and countless other records. ---  --- the downside:  the last two songs.  they're of forgettable quality.  while happy, forgettable.  overall, this album is an essential
I dont remember watching He Man growing up, but I think I saw this movie. I watched this movie without thinking it would be anything speical, and I was wrong. The preview really drew me into the movie before I watched it. It was pure fun, and an excellent sci fi movie. Dolph Lundgreen was the main source for finding this movie, thanks Dolph! Where the heck are you these days? I didnt check all reviews but at the very, very end of the movie Skeltor comes on and says "I'll be back". Ha! Guess that movie never happened. 
These are another neat taste experience from japan. The chocobabies, however, contain shellac as an ingredient, which kinda turned me off to them when I learned about it. The stars in this set are the strawberry-chocolate cone things, whatever they're called. They're delicious! Also, the coffee flavored ones are excellent. I'm finding I am a fan of just about anything made by Meiji, and this set is no exception
I just purchased this item two days ago (Thurs.) Today (Sat.) I removed my 160GB Seagate HHD from my Kingwin enclosure and installed it in this one. Installation was not a problem although the molex connector seems to be a tight fit and is almost touching the fan. Fan noise does not seem to be a problem yet. I used the Firewire connection instead of USB and the drive access is much faster than it was with the USB connection on the other enclosure. The price is a little steep compared to others but I got a generous rebate offer with my purchase. Although the case is plastic (my other one was aluminum and plastic) I won't be moving mine around so that won't be an issue
If you are someone who could care less about carbs and the Atkins diet, Splenda is an awesome sugar substitute.  Some dont have a choice on whether or not they can have sugar, Splenda is the best substitute I can find.  That includes my grandfather as well.  Thank you for Spenda!
This is a great pair of swimming goggles.  I swim a couple of times a week and I can't see a thing without my glasses.  This pair is very comfortable and does a great job correcting my vision.  I can't imagine swimming without them.  They have a wide field of vision, the adjustment is easy to use, and stays adjusted.  I've never had a problem with leaking.  For less then twenty dollars you can't go wrong. They are the best goggles I have ever owned.  Much better then the other brands.   ---  --- Also, I recommend going slightly less then your current prescription, as the water will magnify things. ---  --- 
I asked my sister to buy this bike for my daughter for xmas last year - she decided to buy another one for my nephew also since he is the same age as my daughter (2 yrs old at the time). She bought the two bikes at the same time, same model, same color, same store. My daughter, who is far more coordinated then my nephew, tips over very easy, my nephew seems to do fine. My daughter is taller and that may be where the difference lies. Perhaps the height of the child using the trike is what is causing the trike to tip easily. Not sure - but I know I regret that she ever got the bike -it was a total waste of money
I'd love to read a review from anyone who has purchased this camera, the Aiptek Zoom DV-6 MP Image Stabilizing Camcorder w/3x Optical Zoom.  I see the claim that it has 3x OPTICAL zoom and cannot help but question this because I am unable to find this product on aiptek-dot-com and this cam has supposedly been available since July 30th, 2006.  Am wondering what gives with that?   ---  --- Please someone, post a review of this model and hopefully, some picture results too.  Let us know about this 3x optical zoom, please!     ---  --- I had to pick a rating, so the four star rating was based on the MPVR version of this camera -- which I own and find to be a very decent gadget.  Mine is over a year old and still going strong - no problems with that model.  MP3's sound terrific.  I convert movies for viewing on the camera while on the go and... "wow" for its quality.  I have recorded sounds and more.  Very decent!  Just drag and drop my files from my PC to the SD card and I can switch out movies and MP3's.  I am happy with that model, but it does not have any optical zoom - just digital.  Still get pretty good pix tho, just use the various settings...  My little homemade movies are good, very decent, but without additional lighting, indoor movies will be dark.  This camera doesnt handle well in strong sun - I use an umbrella over my cam as I film.  Big diff.   ---  --- So, is this newer model really all that much better?  Can't wait to know!  3x optical sounds good..
This backpack is sturdy, good looking, very functional and at at least a third of the price of other similar backpacks I looked at, I'm completely satisfied with this purchase
I received my order and was very dissapointed.  The skin tones online are deceiving.  I ordered the medium and it appears like clay and ashy.  Doesn't blend well with skin.  Suggest you order a darker color to match your skin tone
For a basic money management software, this product met my expectations.  No frills but very easy to use.  Convenient calendar of payments and scheduled payments showing my balance after each transaction.  I set my account up in 20 minutes.  There isn't a manual but for the price and ease of use, I don't need one
I have hard facial hairs (Thanks Dad!!) and after being Gilette user (last used Mac 3), I finally decided to go back to classic style of shaving with Double Edge (DE) razor and blades. Merkur are the first ones I have used after the multi-edge blades and after 4-5 shaves, I am getting closer shaves (w/ no irritation) than by using mutli-edge ones. Also, to get better results, I would recommend a "Badger" brush which really softens the skin before these DE blades with a good heavy razor (Merkur is a good one) can smoothly get your facial stubs. Good luck !
I bought my Harvey toy a while ago, and I was quite pleased. It's actually very durable, like everyone else has said. The crane doesn't break off, no matter how often you play with it or how hard you may accidentaly step on it. I think the only way to break it off is via steam roller. ---  --- Anyway, highly recommended for any Thomas collector
This just arrived Thursday so these comments come with minimal time on camera so far. I am also absolutely an amateur user of camcorders so I won't be able to comment on the quality of the manual controls, etc. ---  --- I agree closely with the other two reviews so I won't repeat their details. I'll try to hit a few other topics and also compare the HC7 to the Sony HC90, an earlier model that took 16:9 standard definition video with 3 MP stills. ---  --- I have taken about one hour of HD video so far, and have viewed it through an HDMI cable on a Sony 46" XBR LCD TV (1080p). I captured a few indoor scenes, a few neighborhood outdoor scenes, and some footage at Harper's Ferry in West Virginia - river, mountain, and two trains passing by at close range while I was at the railroad station there. I can say comfortably that you won't confuse the video from this camcorder with Standard Definition camcorder video - when they say High Definition, they aren't kidding.  If your TV can show the video off to advantage and you've grown fond of HD, I think you'd be pleased with this camcorder.  In my case, the overwhelming reason I upgraded camcorders was to get the HD video, so this has made it worth the steep expense. My second requirement is to have a camcorder that took decent stills so I only have to carry one piece of equipment around. I already had this in the Sony HC90 at 3MP, so going up to 6MP was desirable but not enough to make me buy something this expensive in itself. ---  --- My only output criticisms so far are that the West Virginia footage looks a little brighter and the water a little greener than I remember. I didn't play with any settings so take that with a grain of salt. These camcorders have a lot of manual adjustments you can make which I have not explored. One or more of them undoubtedly would have given me improved footage, and I'm not unhappy with what I think I noticed in the slightest. ---  --- The stills look very good to me so far, but I've only taken about 20 and viewed them on the TV. I normally view stills on a PC. ---  --- I don't have a telephoto lens yet so I can't report on the quality of the stabilization. I used a tripod today and that was readily apparent in the stability of the video.  I was very pleased, by the way, with how well the camera did with the moving trains. Very crisp where I expected a fair bit of motion blur. ---  --- LCD size and controls have been mentioned in First Looks. I'm perfectly happy with a 2.7" LCD instead of the larger one in the UX7. So this wasn't a negative for me personally. The controls (menus) are highly similar to those of the Sony HC90 I already have. If you haven't seen them before, there's a learning curve. If you have the HC90 or another camcorder with those menus, you'll be right at home with the HC7. One note: you can configure P[ersonal]-Menus to include the things you use the most in your own order, in addition to the camcorder's menus. One thing I forgot is that each mode (video, camera, play/edit) has its own configurable personal menu. So I was looking for things to add to the Play/Edit personal menu that I was sure should be configurable, but couldn't find them. That was because they belonged only to the filming side, not to the playback side. So you've got three personal menus you can create, not one. ---  --- Battery: check the sizes on the batteries. The HC90 batteries were very thin. I think three of the batteries for the HC7 fit entirely within its case. The fourth and largest battery looked to be much bigger in one dimension such that I thought it would extend past the end of the camera 1/2" or so. The other three will fit flush into the back of the camera, though they're not behind a door or anything. ---  --- Battery life: my impression so far is that the battery life statements are accurate, but the batteries drain faster than that of the HC90. This is almost certainly a function of increased power load instead of the older batteries being better than the newer ones.  The CCDs and the stills and everything are all "more" than in the HC90. So I think I'm fine with the battery life, but you'll need to watch it and definitely have more than one battery. ---  --- Size compared to the HC90: this struck me as being about 10-15% bigger overall than the HC90. It's maybe 1/2" longer front to back, and wider as well. I think the HC7 is one notch up in size from the average camcorder I see in Best Buy. But it's noticeably smaller than last year's SR1 Sony hard disk camcorder, say. I don't see dropping this one in a coat pocket like I did with the HC90, but it's pretty light and still fits in the case I used for the HC90 if I don't load other stuff in there. ---  --- Fit in the hand: I found a Best Buy with an HC5 and UX5 on hand and played with both at the same time. These have the same footprint as the HC7 and UX7 as far as I can tell. The HC5's tape case is maybe 3/8" wider than the UX5's DVD case.  The UX5's DVD case is maybe 1/4" higher. So I found that my right-hand fingers curled nicely around the smaller but taller UX5 and it felt slightly more comfortable. However, I found that the HC5's extra width made me curl my palm slightly such that the base of the camcorder fit solidly on top of the ball of my thumb. As I played with this in the store, I realized it seemed like the HC5 actually was easier to hold stable because of this. Absolutely try these two out on your own instead of assuming this will be true for you. Just wanted to say that the two cases do differ a bit and will probably feel different to you at some level. ---  --- Tape vs DVD (really HDV vs AVCHD): I spent a lot of time wondering if the noise reported in last year's AVCHD UX camcorders would still be present, and if I would care in any case. The detailed reviews still aren't out, so I don't know whether there will be a noise problem there. But I can say I noticed nothing in the footage so far that I'd call noise, so my decision to go with the tape and HDV format looks very good to me right now. I have never had the problems people report with Mini-DV tapes, so that whole transport discussion (tape vs DVD) didn't weigh on me much. The noise discussion did have an effect on my decision, though. ---  --- Getting the video to your TV: "how much money do we have?", apparently. I played the tape back to the TV directly, but that's not a long-term solution. I have heard that you can capture the HDV video and then will be able to transform it on a PC to formats suitable for Blu-Ray or HDV burners, if you have the money. Then you need a Blu-Ray or HDV player attached to your TV. For now, it sounds like many people are archiving the HDV video to DVDs as data files. Then they burn playable DVDs where the HD is down-converted to standard definition video.  So they get to see decent versions of the video now and can produce HD versions for playback in the future as technology changes and prices drop.  One other HC7 reviewer also implied that HD files captured by Ulead software could be moved to a PS3 hard drive and played back to an HD TV from there. So far, the easy and cheap path we have for SD video to DVDs to TVs is not quite there for HD based on what I've read.  ---  --- The one extra feature I wish the camcorder had was a built-in 20X optical zoom. I'm sure this would affect both the cost and the size of the barrel negatively, so I "understand". But that would be #1 on my wish list. ---  --- Overall, I am amazed at what camcorder manufacturers can pack into these shells now.  I know we're talking computers that are way more powerful at image processing than anything that existed ten years ago.  But it is still almost like magic to drag a camcorder of this size around, take some video, and then have play it back on a high-quality HD TV looking to me like it was taken with broadcast-level equipment. I know better intellectually, but it's really great to have a camcorder like this that marries up with the new TVs so beautifully.      --- 
Sit down under a tree, give it a big hug, fire up you bong and go to sleep. That's what I was waiting for Freeman to do all movie. It's a shame that special effects that were so ground breaking were waisted on this Sci-fi Hippie flick. I'm surprised that Freeman's suit wasn't tie-dyed. Keep your money say no to drugs!
If you really like Chinese food, you might like this chicken stew.  However, it was much too sweet tasting for my tastes.   ---  --- The main reason that I give it 2 stars is that it contains the artificial sweetner Splenda (see "sucralose" in the ingredients), but that is not advertised anywhere on the package besides the small print in the ingredient list. ---  --- I personally don't eat or drink products that contain artificial sweetners for various reasons, and had I known the product contained Splenda, I wouldn't have purchased it honestly.  It has the typical Splenda "after taste.
Having just gone back to using a film camera from digital (my wife still uses digital) I have found this to be an excellant camera so far. I have taken 6 rolls of film and everyone one has came out perfect. I would recommend it
I lvoed this movie I have been looking for it for years. The story plot is ok but the dancing in the movie is awesome and the music is great. It just wants to make you get up and dance
Ever since starting on the SIMPLE ABUNDANCE journey with Sarah Ban Breathnach's first book, I have longed for an opportunity to learn one-on-one from the Queen of simplicity and authenticity. We may not be able to meet Sarah face-to-face, but now anyone can enjoy a workshop  atmosphere in the comfort of her own home. Women caught up in the  day-to-day deluge of deadlines, appointments, and commitments can now curl  up with a pillow and excavate their authentic self. I highly recommend this  book to anyone who wants to savor their life instead of living in a blur
I really like these tapes.  The first one is pretty easy, but it is very relaxing, and i use it on days when I want to take it easy.  The second one is somewhat challenging, and the third one is even more so.  These tapes are a great guide from a beginning level to a more advanced one.  Tracy Rich is a very good instructor and makes you feel comfortable.  I also like how they (Ganga White and Tracy) show different versions of the poses with one being more advanced
I bought this ear plugs, are uncomfortable, my ears hurt, and in the first use, just fall down I just prefered the ones who are made of pvc, are better
Solidly built, this tripod balances well even when used with the heavier Sony Cybershots like the DSC-R1. The remote shuttle release button helps to further reduce camera shake, which is priceless when taking photos in conditions where camera shake is amplified (high optical zoom, supressed flash, etc). ---  --- What surprises me is the fact that the shuttle release button on the remote works exactly the same as any Sony Cybershot : press halfway to focus, and all the way down to capture the shot. ---  --- The zooming buttons do not work for the Sony DSC-R1 as the camera has a manual zooming ring, but they should work fine with any other Cybershot that comes with an electronic zoom and of course, an ACC terminal. ---  --- Highly recommended.
Per the description, it sounded like these would fit snug.  Well, they fit too snug, feeling very cramped. I have a 33 inch waist, and ordered the 32/34 waist.   I'm used to boxer briefs made from cotton.  This was the first time that I've got polyester boxer briefs.  Unless you like 'um really tight, you might want to go to the next size up, or just get cotton briefs.  I'm throwing these away
Which I suppose I'm not allowed to say, what with the worldwide phenomenon that was Songs From the Big Chair. But I think it's right. Roland took the opportunity following the breakup with Curt to make an aggressively postmodern record, and return to the steely-eyed austerity that the lyrics on The Hurting always suggested.  Indeed, this album is continually proving to be ahead of its time; as a previous reviewer noted, "Goodnight Song" has what has since become a familiar AOR sound. I call it the first "Coldplay" song, and it's fair to suggest that band would never exist without Tears For Fears. ---  --- Roland also finally nails the pacing of an album here. On Songs and Seeds, 8 tracks was not enough to allow for a full dynamic arc, a sense of opening, progression, and completion; the 10 songs here have room to breathe, vary significantly between each other and finally close satisfyingly with "Goodnight". ---  --- As both Roland and Curt have matured, they have also mellowed. The anger they felt at the world and towards each other seems to be gone. And their latest album, Everybody Loves a Happy Ending, has none of the dge that made their older stuff so energizing. But CDs don't age, so pick this sucker up. It really doesn't get much better
This product is difficult to use and does not clearly cover the scratches on the lenses as advertised.  There are bubbles in the product that do not clear up as it dries.  I do not recommend this!  Just get new glasses
We just had our son in January and we couldn't resist these cute little shoes. Even though he's only 3 months old we can't wait to see our little guy in them. What a well made product!
In the ad, this cable charger claims to sync and charge but will not hotsync to my Treo. It will charge but I already have a home and a car charger so it serves me no purpose. Falsely calims to sync
The lady can sing, but her "Christian" message is compromised because of her part in "Chasing Papi", where she played a woman who - had she had the chance - would have hopped into bed with her on-screen boyfriend prior to marriage.  It's "Crystal Clear" to me that Jaci broke my heart in a million pieces when she played that part.  It's really tragic to see such a beautiful young lady with such a opowerful voice and message now reduced to nothing more than a hypocritical wannabee, much in the same way that Stacie Orrico is now becoming.....and is it just me, or is it coincidence that these two womens' album covers look strikingly similar?  It appears their paths in life are similar, too: compromising a message and a stand that once set them worlds apart.  As with a recent review of Orrico that I made, I'll give Jaci Velasquez her due:  she can sing, and what I mean by that is sing the roof off of a house!  This album was excellent.....was.  Now, whenever I think or hear of Jaci Velasquez, I can only think one word:  HYPOCRITE
To be quite honest, although there was a stunning cast, the plot was gory. It was sweet and had it's element of romance, but it was too morbid for me to enjoy. If you are watching for Drew Barrymore, don't bother. she only  appears halfway through the movie and then only sporadically afterwards.  Dean Cain on the other hand looks mighty fine, if you're after a gay man.  It's not the type of movie you want your children to watch. Trust me
Don't waste your money.  I bought two of these.  A few weeks later several moles tunneled within 10 feet of the one in the same places as last year.  I put one in my gardern - a few weeks later a mole tunneled right alongside the molechaser as if to see what it was to his delight!  Total waste of money like everthing else I've tried except Nash loop traps
This Tea gives you the flavor of the Japanese Way of Tea Ceremony. --- A beautiful fragrance and taste. --- Be sure to prepare it in the traditional way. ---  --- Arigato to Maeda-En.  A Great Matcha. ---  --- Ron
Please think this DVD is recorded in 1986. More worse, this is recorded as a documentary. Sound quality is worst. After I bought this and DVD of "Company" (same, worst sound quality DOCUMENTARY), I suspect the word "concert" or "soundtrack" in DVD title
This years madden wasn't worth all this hype over. I have every madden so far and this one was no different than last years game. Graphics are o.k,gameplay gets repeditive at points and it doesn't have the true madden gameplay as before. It's just ok not super and semi dissapointing. The things that caught me off guard was Vince Young and Reggie Bush arent starters so you have to do that on your own by going to rosters and actually making them right!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Overall i wasnt amazed. Also the worst part is the new controls. You need to use the right analog stick to juke, spin and do shake n' bake moves. ---  --- please agree with me people!!!!!!!!!!!!
I don't see the difference between these bodysuits and the more expensive ones.  Fits my boy just right
Got a deal on the machine, and love the concept.  But every senseo coffee I have tasted has been absolutely horrible.  I've tried 4 oz with one pod- way too bitter so 8 oz with 1 pod...still the most awful coffee I've ever had.  Normally I drink Gevalia, but I use Folgers sometimes or Millstone... --- I don't think I could drink this stuff on a regular basis if someone paid me.  Of all the purchases I've made at Amazon, this has been the first time I've ever felt compelled to give feedback.  That in itself speaks volumes
i like guru because it has a more natural feeling towards your body. after drinking monster all day, my body felt like a mess(from the many unnatural chemicals it does to your body).  There are so many energy drinks out there that have loads of chemicals, its harder to find stuff like guru and bawls. 
I was so disappointed in this film. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the heart and soul Terrance Howard put into his acting. I love Terrance, he is an outstanding actor but seeing him playing a pimp was just embarrassing. He did an excellent job with the acting but I would have much rather seen him portraying Marvin Gaye. Call me naive but is pimping still actually going on in Memphis, Tennessee in this day and time? And did Terrance Howard give Ludacris' character a cassette tape to listen to? Not a CD, a tape. I probably would have flushed it down the toilet too. And the hook to that song, "You know it's hard out here for a pimp." Ya think? With prostitution being illegal in the state of Tennessee and all. I found myself cringing and sliding down in my seat in the theatre when she began to sing because I was so embarrassed. Don't get me wrong, I love my black people but sometimes when we get a chance to make a major motion picture we just don't quite bring it, do we? "The Cookout" "How High?" "Girl 6" "Woo" "Kingdom Come" Now we can add "Hustle and Flow" to the list. I'm glad Terrance Howard redeemed himself in "Crash." Do yourself a favor and pass on this one.
Last month,Feb.10, I ordered one box this wipes. But when I opened it today, all bag showed the exp.12/31/2006. I am wondering how to contact them
I thoroughly enjoy this collection of hits from The Mamas and the Papas. Every song is fun and the tunes will stay with you long after you're done listening. ---  --- Like other selections from the 20th Century Masters series, this can't be called a complete collection. However, what is included is fantastic and I find myself popping it into my CD player much more often than many other CDs. ---  --- My copy of this CD (which I bought new) includes an 8-page folder with two photos of the band (besides the cover photo), a short band biography written by Joseph F. Laredo, and a track listing with song writing and original release credits. Song lyrics are not included. The jewel case is fully transparent with another photo of the band on the inside of the back paper. ---  --- As a side note, if you are a fan of the ABC television series "Lost" this CD includes the Mama Cass song "Make Your Own Kind Of Music" that is featured on Desmond's record player in the hatch. ---  --- If you're just starting with The Mamas and the Papas, or simply want a brief overview of some of their better known songs, this is a great CD. ---  --- For more The Mamas and the Papas, check out Criterion's phenomenal DVD release of Monterey Pop (or the box set The Complete Monterey Pop Festival). This concert DVD is absolutely brilliant, and includes several songs from The Mamas and the Papas.
PRIVATE RESORT is the kind of movie that was geared towards young adult audiences in the mid-80s when sexual awareness and exposition were the hot ticket in theatres.  However, I'm sure this film is one that Johnny Depp, Hector Elizondo and Rob Morrow aren't proud to have on their resume. --- The movie's plot is slim, and neither Morrow or Depp have any screen presence in this early stage of their careers.  Elizondo tries gamely and pulls off a few laughs, but he's not at his best either.  Most of the film's laughs come from Leslie Hope as a slightly off kilter cosmic bimbo; Dody Goodman as a dotty old lady who knows karate and Tony Azito as a bumbling hotel security guard.  There's lots of slapstick, some of it works, most of it doesn't.  You can do better, folks
Sorry, this guy's voice gave me the creeps. He sounds like a preacher. Who can meditate without the ability to respond positively to the  leading   voice

I'm sorry to give this a poor review, but tea has to taste good in order for me to drink it. I often drink a large variety of bedtime teas and have never tasted any tea this awful. I can't speak for how well it works because I couldn't drink the whole cup even though I attempted to force myself. Yogi makes some good teas, but this I just couldn't stomach.
What is this all about.  I have not ordered this item nor do I have it.  Please reply
My son loves the backback and the spacious room for he has for all the engineering books he needs for class
I was ecstatic when I received this magazine subscription as as gift. Two issues into my subscription it stopped. I was really anticipating the December issue because I had many guests coming and could use some of Martha's helpful advice, however it never came and neither did January or February. I have called Martha Stewart Living magazine twice and while they are very nice and apologetic, I still have not received another issue. When I asked to cancel for a refund I was given a phone number with an automated system that uses a credit card account look up - being that it was a gift this is useless. Very clever for Martha and very frustrating for the giftee/consumer
The author writes a book that does give you a mental workout while giving valuable insight into the theological/philosophical foundations of the emerging confession. There is value in that. I look forward to reading part two, the liturgical ideas section. The emerging church is keen on praxis, but the theological underpinings of this book in part one reminds me of past mistakes within Christendom, which I had hoped we were past.  --- Here are some things that I am amazed do not occur to the others reviewing this book, which it might help to know: ---  --- 1. Rollins does not think it's possible to really "know" much theology with "certainty." In fact, to claim to have religious certainty is to hold an "idolatrous" view of God that is more our idea of God than really who God is. This is because it is virtually impossible to be objective for us humans, and because in his view, God was not all that interested in presenting much of Himself in any sort of nailed down way.  The irony I could not miss was the dogmatism with which he himself expresses his own views. --- He is very certain of his interpretations of "perceptive thinkers like Nietzsche, Freud, and Marx," Eckhart, Augustine, etc... and is very certain that his interpretations of the scattered verses from Scripture are correct. I found his use of proof texting for his ideas to be really, really, faulty. As I'm reading along I kept jotting in the margins all the times what he said was a really pretty clear misunderstanding of the New Testament. So, be prepared for a frustrating read if you know the Bible's basic content.  He is certain that no one should be certain, but him. Ok, to be fair, he is not certain if Christianity is true, and says so on page 44, but he is certain that he should not be certain of Christianity. Nor, I guess, should you. With his view of "critique of ideology" how can he be so selective of what he is certain of. This seems like a self-defeating ideology.  --- So strong is his disdain for "knowing" with any real certainty that he would do away with apologetics as if it were no longer appropriate to try to base our beliefs on reason at all. I was reminded of the case Francis Schaeffer made quite well regarding those who do not have any reason to believe something is true, but who take a leap of faith and believe it anyway. Rollins needs to reread his Francis Schaeffer, in my opinion.  --- He says the church is not to be about giving answers, but helping raise in people: questioning. Indeed, given his views, how could he provide answers? This book may look deep. I propose, it is merely muddy. ---  --- 2. He redefines age old terms. Orthodoxy is no longer about the content of what one believes, but how loosely one holds it. Certainty of revealed truth is dangerous, misinformed, idolatrous. Heresy is now a cute little thing. It has come of age. He says people will think his views undermine Christianity. We are to just take him at his word that his views won't do so, but he does not really make affirmations to give any reasonable comfort and any one would, I think, see the writing on the wall. ---   --- 3. He seems to think the emerging church is the only hope for unity or evangelism in our time among post moderns. After reading his views I wonder if it is possible for post moderns, those like himself, at least, to even understand the gospel. He has not. How can he be a bridge? To be a bridge one must have footing on both shores. Christianity IS based on real events with real content that has been passed down, not without mystery, nor without debate, but in a very real and tangible way. he cannot be a bridge to something by changing that thing to something else. ---   --- 4. He is right to be kind to people of other religions and to try to learn from them. The problem that is huge, and no one seems to notice, is that he seems incapable of learning or appreciating the Christians who are in other camps. He considers fundamentalists,and by logical extension many evangelicals, to be pharisees and the true heretics in his new definition of the term, heresy. I kept thinking, what kind of "fundamentalists" is he so angry at? He blasts the whole of that group and by extension most evangelicals, making generalizations that are misleading. Very unobjective. Unkind. Very divisive. Yet he thinks only his views can bring unity to Christendom. I can see his views bringing unity to all religions, but it will never bring unity to Christendom. He seems oblivious to the amazing amount of unity that now exists in Christendom. Times have really changed in the past 20 years. He is either unaware or has a different kind of unity in mind.  ---  --- 5. He makes God hopelessly difficult. God wanted, it seems, to speak in a plain brown wrapper...the common language of the people, the dust of humanity, the lowly donkey ride, the obscure but simple truth of the simple gospel. Rollins has wrapped God up in Nietzsche and while disdaining "human reason" as the means of knowing God has turned the living Christ who said "I am the truth" into an enigma of mental gymnastics that is so complex only man could concoct it. God's message is simple. It's clear where it needs to be. It hints at huge mystery beyond what is stated. Rollins makes it nearly all enigma, hinting at some possible truth out there from a winking God, who says out of one side of his mouth something is important and that we will be held accountable for knowing and obeying it, yet Who has been unwilling or incapable, given man's weaknesses, or His own lack of communication skills, to articulate it in such a way that a person can hold any theological content soundly. --- If, as Tickle says, this is the Christianity of the 3rd millenium, then the Chrisitan faith is about to become the irrational man's religion, the anything goes religion, and following generations will have to deconstruct today's extreme and irrational over-reaction to fundamentalism. Peter, I can learn some stuff from you, and I'm sure some of my perception of what you were trying to say was likely lost in transmission. As it stands now I cannot agree with you on several points. Your views trouble me. Nothing against you personally.  Forgive any kind of perceived condescending tone. I hope to enjoy the rest of your book much more, though, it will for me be an upper story with out a first floor. Regardless, if it inspires I'll come back and add a star. hmmm
I wore out my tape of Cypress.  Afoot is great, but Cypress is amazing.  I bought this while stationed in the Army.  There weren't too many "new wave" tapes available at the PX, and I wasn't going to listen to Def Leppard or Bon Jovi.  So I bought Cypress. ---  --- One of those rare tapes that I bought 20 years ago and still listen to every few months (The Jam's Snap and Setting Sons, and The Smith's Hatful of Hollow are 3 other tapes I never tired of).  ---  --- Get this CD.  Get it now!   It is great.   Thanks for reissuing it.
I've found the Omron very easy and practical to use.  It gives very good estimates of body fat percentages and BMI (body mass index) which can easily be used to illustrate a personal rate of progress for any dietary or weight training program.  For the money, it would be difficult to find something better
I was happy with the noise canceling features, not the best but definitely works.  Great for airplane rides - really helps cut out that background engine noise.  My problem however with these headphones hwoever is the design - the first set i had brok near the earpiece hinge and was replaced by Targus (cheers to them).  the second set broke too in a different place - the deisgn of these just isn't very sturdy.  I'm gentle with my stuff too, so either I had bad luck w/two defective units or they're just not made well
This device is great for carriying around with your camera, you can review and share the pictures with any PC with USB available, data can also be recorded and easily recovered.
I have a PowerBook, an iMac, and an eMac at home that are used in different ways. The kids use the eMac for school work, and my wife & I use the other 2 Macs for home business. ---  --- Although most school work was required in MS-PowerPoint or MS-Word, exporting from iWork '06 Pages and Keynote was very simple to do with 90-95% accuracy. Our kids said they just do minor editing at school before submitting the work. ---  --- For home business, we use Pages to do our proposals, bills, and receipts. And use Keynote for presentations. One thing that I thought was amazing, is the fact that I can display the notes and the succeeding slide on my PowerBook, while projecting just the current slide for the customer to see.  ---  --- For the price of the Family Pack, we were licensed to use iWork '06 on 5 Macs on the same network. The cost fitted our budget perfectly. The only thing I wish was available in Keynote was timed transition (example: after 3 seconds show bullet#1, after 5 seconds show bullet#2, after 2 seconds show the chart
I ordered the Cisco Aironet 1231 the other day, and after it arrived, set it up, and...couldn't get a wireless signal. I called customer support and was told I would be called back by a technician (which obviously the first person was not) within an hour. We waited...and got online to try to figure things out. Turns out that in VERY small print on an obscure documentation page of the 1231 it says at the very bottom that two external antennae are needed for the 2.4 GH wireless (802.11b/g) to work. I was even more disappointed to find out that the required antennae were available online for only $16 a piece, which makes Cisco look really cheap for not including such a small but vital item with a $500 router. ---  --- Although it took an astonishing twelve hours for customer support to get back to me, since I registered my complaint with them they have been very helpful. I really hope that they improve their web site-it really is not that helpful since you have to weed through pages of documentation before you can even begin to find information you need. I still haven't used this router since I'm waiting for the required antennae I had to order somewhere else. Cisco routers are supposed to be good, but as a warning to you, the potential customer, be aware that 1) you need to purchase external antennae with this product; 2) my initial experience with customer service was pretty disappointing
I bought the software some months ago.  Noticed some problems with my PC in subsequent weeks. Didn't put 2 and 2 together.  Last week however, I'd come home - no icons on screen - no ability to Ctrl-Alt_Del - each day this would happen. The machine had to be powered on and off to reboot. Pulled recent software off machine. Yes - you've guessed - without Spy Sweeper I have no problems. OK - it might be a conflict with other software - a quick Google confirmed my suspicions that others have problems. I was never impressed that it was picking up anything of substance either - but then maybe my machine is clean
owned a different brand that was noisy and only worked for about a month......this winder i can not hear it run and have had it a couple of months....it is still running like clock work......would recommend to anyone that doesnt want to pay an arm and leg for one.....
The story of "Hansel and Gretel" is more than a warning against children talking to strangers (or trying to eat their houses).  The recurring image of the forest in German fairy tales is a supernatural world where interesting things happen, while the fact the father of Hansel and Gretel is a woodcutter is significant because this was one of the lowliest occupations at that time.  Therefore, what we have here is the triumph of the poor working class characters over the witch and her upper class pretentions (she stores not only treasure but food), which would make her death some sort of proto-Marxist warning if you are ideologically inclined in that direction. ---  --- In the original manuscript of the story of the siblings were referred to as Little Brother and Little Sister.  The Brothers Grimm chose Hansel because it was a common name in German fairy tales (their equivalent of John Doe so to speak) and picked Gretel for essentially the same reason (which makes her Jane Doe).  Gretel (or Gretchen) is a form of the name Margaret, which in Latin (Margarita) means "pearl."   ---  --- All that background makes it rather ironic that for its Twisted Fairy Tale series McFarlane Toys has turned Gretel into a German princess, striking a pose that suggests "Getting lost in the woods is the least of her worries."  This six-inch figure has tattoos, a spiked collar around her neck, and torn fish net stockings.  There are more details for you to discover when you look over the figure carefully, and while she is not exactly a princess of bondage, Gretel appears to be familiar with the neighborhood.  She also has a mop and a pail, and there is ample reason to think she knows how to use them (the mind reels at the possibilities for rewriting the Grimms tale). ---  --- Twisted Fairy Tales is the fourth series of McFarlane's Monsters, and the rest of the menagerie consists of not only Gretel's tag team partner Hansel, but Red Riding Hood, Peter Peter Pumpkin Eater, and Little Miss Muffet.  If you were aware about the probable origins of a lot of the classic fairy tales then you already knew that Mother Goose had a twisted sense of humor.  With these figures McFarlane Toys certainly takes being twisted to the next level.  Even if you do not want the entire set, there should be one of these figures that captures the Jungian dark side of the tales that we were all raised on once upon a time that most appeals to you
This sparkling juice really holds up to the description.  It has the perfect amount of carbonation (not too much, not too little), is crisp to the taste, and is very refreshing.  The 8 oz. cans sounded pretty weak, but it turns out that one can is the perfect amount for a sitting. ---  --- Since first tasting Martinelli's sparkling apple cider at a New Year's celebration over a decade ago, I've been a huge fan of carbonated apple drinks, but none have been "just right."  Naturally, I've tasted the types that I've come across over the years, including: Martinelli's sparking cider (which is kind of sweet tasting and not generally bottled for everyday consumption), Martinelli's sparkling apple juice (a bit under-carbonated), Apple Beer (non-alcoholic, good but has a slightly odd taste), Appletiser (UK only, good, but UK only), and a few other local organic brands. ---  --- All of the aforementioned beverages are good on occasion, but seriously... none compare to essn's Sparkling Fuji Apple Juice.  Yeah, it is a little pricey, but its worth it
This pen needs gel ink to make it perfect.  The regular ink is often difficult to get flowing.  But it does the job.  PenAgain products were the only ones that caused me no pain after surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome and tennis elbow
In Touch is a weekly glossy magazines that retails at newstands for $1.99.  It is very similar to Star and Us Weekly.  They offer fodder on the Hollywood flavor of the moment, so expect lots of stories about Julia Roberts, Britney Spears, Brad Pitt, Jenifer Aniston, J.Lo and the usual suspects.  It is very worth the newstand price.  They rarely, if ever have human interest stories, most of the stories are all about celebrities, style, make-up, or fashion. They also have contests some times. A lot of times I notice they run the same stories and pictures as Us Weekly so if I had to choose between In Touch and Us Weekly 1 year subscription is less I would choose Us because it still seems like they get more exclusive stories that In Touch.  Also, some of the news they run sometimes is weeks old, I often think they end up filling space close to print time. It's an okay magazine an worth the cover price
I am a seamstress who knows how to sew, and how to thread both top and bobbin threads.  My daughter received this machine for Christmas.  We threaded it according to directions.  It sews about 10 stitches then jams.  I observe that the bobbin design is such that the bobbin wobbles within the casing, and leads to a jam every time.  Don't disappoint a child by purchasing this
I love it that card my childrens have one for your own games...
I have only used clinique eye shadows and have been so happy with them. I've tried different brands and always come back to this one. They have great colors and it lasts all day without creasing or looking too "powdery".
I bought a pack of long sleeve and pack of short sleeve onsies for my 18 month old.  Luvable Friend's onsies are awful.  The biggest issue is that they use velcro instead of snaps to secure the onesies.  And the velcro doesn't even stick.  They becomes undone and fly loose within minutes.  Also the sizing is way too large for the average 18 month old. Lastly even the shirt tag stinks. It is this cheap oversized tag that I had to cut off because it was so uncomfortable to my son.  Shame on them for making such a cheap product - shame on you if you buy these onsies after reading this review! 
This is a great laser pointer and the brighter wavelength of the green laser makes a huge difference. But to see the beam (not just the dot at the end of the beam) you need some sort of particles in the air for the light to bounce off of. Using the laser pointer with a little dust or mist in the air will make the beam clearly stand out. And if you are wondering, no matter how bright your laser is, without particles in the air you wont see the beam. At concerts where they use the big argon lasers, they always have fog machines near them to give give the laser something to bounce its light off of
I bought this product on the strength of the Norton name, and a positive review in Business Week.    I uninstalled ZoneLabs, Ad-Aware, and all Norton anti-virus.  There were still NAV files after the uninstall.  I had to download their Norton Software Removal tool, which also could not remove some NAV files.   Everytime I re-boot, those problematic NAV files want to re-launch NAV.   ---  --- The NIS 2007 install was still difficult after all of that effort, and once installed NIS 2007 either freezes up my computer, or makes my internet connection so slow that it is un-usable. ---  --- So, now I've uninstalled NIS 2007, still have issues with the corrupt NAV files, and will being go back to ZoneLabs and Ad-Aware. --- 
These boots are warm and comfortable, like my sheepskin slippers.  My feet are toasty, even when it's freezing outside.  They have a thicker sole than some other styles, which makes this boot great for walking in snow and ice.  I love the warm brown of the chestnut.  They look great!  At 50% off, the price was great, too
Hilarious from beginning to end!  Dr. Pearl er Eugene Levy, will you marry me???? 
other places where offering 4 or 5 oz for the same price. it was sent and arrived quickly, faster than expected.  great for asian recipes. good deal
My wife and I (yep a guy reviewing a kids toy!) bought this as a present for our 7 month old niece. She is absolutely hooked on it. Having a relatively short attention span with most toys, it was rewarding to see how much she likes it and how long it entertains her. Just squeezing the musical tentacles for her keeps her happy! The big doe eyes have her mesmerized as well. When she gets bored, learning to play tunes keeps the adults happy!!  ---  --- Playing is easy, you get two color coded tunes on the label and with the help of a musical friend we know a lot more now. ---  --- With my wife 4 months pregnant, we have ordered another already. ---  --- Only reason for 4 stars is the one we bought had trouble playing the lowest note (red tentacle!)
Better Homes and Gardens has been a staple in our home for years. This essential magazine seems to always be there for you. When I think about it I would say that it has enriched our home and ultimately our lives. Its very visual style of lending ideas for enhancing our domicile and our surroundings has always been simple yet effectual in enriching our lives
I purchased this program for my personal and home business tax return but it did not include all the forms needed so I had to buy another version from them. H&R TaxCut included all I needed and was 1/2 the price
My 2 year old son loves to "cook" and to serve Mommy and Daddy meals from his kitchen.  My only complaint is that it falls over easily and it seems we are often picking it up off the floor.  It isn't very sturdy, but I'm not unhappy with this purchase
i recently saw them in san francisco just like one of the other reviewers, and i thought it was astonishing. i know a lot of people got mad cause they didnt move around or anything, i mean it couldn't be because they were trying to concentrate or anything like that! the great thing about this album is that all the instruments standout at the same time. farina(the lead singer)has calmed down after the last couple of albums and often times speaks his lyrics in a soft and heartfelt way that make you wish you could get into a conversation with him right then and there.and his guitar playing has even matures after the bed is in the ocean. the drummer just flat out rocks. his punctuality is a lot of the reason why these guys are so tight. the bass speaks just as well as the guitar does and sometimes takes over as the guitar holds it together and the bassist go off on his own little excursion. well, if you have a problem with a band not rocking out, i dont know what to tell you. it is jazzy, but let me be the one to tell you this is the best jazz i've heard. i think this is the only path they could of taken. you got to evolve. sometimes that cant always be a good thing but in this case ,karate is the exception. love this
 I bought a sight from Airsplat for my son's airsoft rifle as a Christmas gift. The screws were too short to attach it to his Kitty Kat ( a shortened M-4) airsoft rifle's weaver rail. Yes, I could go out and find screws the proper length, but I though I'd make Airsplat do their job.  ---  --- So, after several e-mails with the service department, they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size. Wrong. The diameter of the new screws is so big they won't fit through the mounting bracket on the sight. Obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws.  ---  --- Why by a gun from these guys? If it arrives broken, you pay to ship it back. Want a refund? You pay a 15% restocking fee. Take a pass on Airsplat. 
I will never order an item like this again as it came destroyed! They need to repackage items like this for shipping. It it the second and the last item of this type I will order online. The other was a bassinet and it also arrived broken with the box destroyed. I have complained before but never get a response...too bad too as I like Amazon
I used it once and it charged my ipod only 80% after about four hours.  The next day I tried it again and it simply ceased functioning entirely.  This thing is garbage! 
Only the front of the bag is actually beaded, and the quality poor. The original price should have been $5 or fewer, to be reasonable. This would make a better toy for a little girl than an actual accessory
Rites of Spring is an unparalleled work of cultural and historical synthesis, and easily the most interesting cultural history of 20th Century Europe available.     
There were a few minor imperfections, but i'm overall happy with this sword.  The attention to detail and replication of Cloud's weapon are commendable
Stretchy, comfortable and made well- love this T-shirt! (Also its a slim fit and not really, really long like many are right now- more of upper hip length, which is great if you want to tuck it in!
This is a great quality product. Best quality transfer paper I've ever used. It's pretty expensive if you buy it here though. You can get this same exact product at your local Office Depot for a cheaper price plus you don't have to pay shipping/handling
I bought these stilts for my 10 year old daughter.  My other children who are 8 and 9 love them and so do all of their friends.  They are affordable and sturdy!!  I recommend them !!!
This little gizmo really does work. It seems to be pretty accurate, too, although it's tough to tell. --- You need to give it a good strong blow to get enough air through the little opening to get a good reading. I've tried using a straw to direct the air better and that seems to work. Unfortunately, there's no sensor that lets you know when it has enough air to take a reading. If there's not enough it just stays green even if there is alcohol present in your breath. Still, for the price it's pretty darned impressive. --- You'll need to experiment a bit because the instructions aren't very accurate
Why pay $46.75 for this battery when you can get the same thing made by another manufacturer (Impact) for only $19.95 at B&H Photo and Video. I have both the the DL-150 Pentax Battery that came with the camera and the Impact IMDL150. I can't tell any difference between them other than the price. Camera makers make a hugh profit on propritory items that can be obtained elsewhere at much lower prices. 
These headphones sound pretty good, but they aren't the best.  When running, the volume controller gets in the way and bounces.  It is also easy to change the volume which is annoying.  I also find the fact that the cord for the right side is longer than the other a little bit strange.  I realize it is done intentionally, but it does nothing for me.  Overall, for just listening at your desk or in your room, these are great headphones.  For running, I would recommend something else
Saw "Hart's War" the other night and couldn't really believe anyone would invest money and time in a film as awful as this one.  This film bombed at the box office and was yanked from circulation after only a few days.   Here are ten reasons why: ---  --- 1.  This film isn't "The Great Escape" and even though he would probably like to think otherwise, Bruce Willis isn't Steve McQueen.  Even though Willis received top billing, this is a Colin Farrell vehicle.  ---   --- 2.  The vast majority of the target audience of 18-34 year old moviegoing males could care less about what happened during the Reagan administration, much less World War II.  "Hart's War" may just as well be a film about a POW camp during the War of 1812.  Anything with Vin Diesel or the Rock would be bound to sell more tickets. ---  --- 3.  As far as depicting life in a POW camp, "Hart's War" is pretty much on par with "Hogan's Heroes".  The Germans are nice guys with guns who don't know very much and everyone gets away with just about anything.  Where did the GI's get all those cigarettes, anyway? ---  --- 4.  Any Stalag Luft comandant worth his weight in sauerkraut would have just as soon killed the Bruce Willis character as look at him.  As depicted in "Hart's War", the camp commandant (as portrayed by Marcel Lures) would have had a very difficult time maintaining any sort of status as an officer in the German Army.  His collection of American jazz/blues records is a cute writer's invention that has nothing to do with the reality of the situation, or of the type of men who were in charge of German POW camps.  In reality, the Marcel Lures character would probably have been relegated to another type of nazi camp with a pink triangle sewn on the front of his tunic. ---  --- 5.  The storyline is not completely unbelievable - trials did take place in POW camps, one good example being the POW's who were tried and hung in Andersonville;  However, the whole idea that the camp's commandant would actively participate in such a trial as sort of a Jerry Springer type advocate is ludicrous. ---  --- 6.  The idea that during the trial, a group of POW's who escape go on a secret mission to destroy a nearby munitions factory is insulting.  Not only did nothing like this ever happen during World War II, it degrades the bravery of those poor souls whose only act of heroism was to survive internment under harsh and sometimes brutal conditions.  The German army simply wasn't that stupid. ---  --- 7.  I saw this film once and didn't like it.  I thought that maybe the second time would be better.  It wasn't. ---  --- 8.  Beyond being sheer Hollywood political correctness, "Hart's War" seriously misrepresents many of the more important aspects of internment.  It ignores the real focus of life in such a Stalag which, for most POW's, was just day to day survival.  Also, the soldiers who served in our armed forces during World War II and also happened to be African Americans weren't spineless, hapless dopes. ---  --- 9.  Bruce Willis playing the same role in variations of "Die Hard" over and over and over again is tiring. ---  --- 10.  Better films about the same sort of subject matter are "The Tuskeegee Airmen" and "Stalag 17".  Hopefully in a few years, "Hart's War" will be completely forgotten, and these dvd's will be rotting in some landfill. ---  
Casual book browsers who stumble across Braden's book, "The Isaiah Effect," might undoubtedly be drawn to the implications of the title: that there exists some mystical, unifying code which is only now being fully understood through modern techniques, research, and understanding. I, as one such browser, had briefly read about the so-called "Bible Code" which computers have now enabled man to explore and thought that the subject of this book might be related. With my interest piqued at the title and the book description, I delved into the pages expecting to learn exactly what encompassed Isaiah's "precise instructions" of prayer. I wanted to know exactly what Braden claimed to have stumbled upon. ---  --- What I found in this 250 page foray into countless subjects was nothing other than a pastiche of new-thought concepts. The mixing of religions, for example - a sort of pick-and-choose spirituality which has slowly been creeping its way into the mainstream for decades - is recycled over and over again, drawing from endless sources of gnostic gospels and other lost books. In only one chapter does Braden actually begin to describe in detail verses from the book of Isaiah. Instead he relegates the books of the Essenes to positions of higher authority and prominence. ---  --- In the brief pages in which Braden actually does discuss Isaiah, his conclusions speak nothing of a decoded lost science. His basic premise of "The Effect" is that people can alter their futures by the choices they make in the present. Such a revelation is not a new interpretation of Isaiah at all. Any student of the Bible and Christianity knows that all the prophetic books of the Old Testament are records of God warning Israel, and the world, of turning away from Him. ---  --- To Braden's credit, his discussions of the effects of prayer in today's society are commemorable, albeit somewhat misguided. I agree with him that people in today's society need to turn away from the petty details of life with which they've surrounded themselves. However, I believe Braden over-emphasizes the role of feelings and emotion in prayer. He fails to discuss how humans, and their emotions, are extremly fallable and can change as quickly as the winds in his anecdotes. ---  --- Braden wants desperately to believe that the true power of prayer is to be found in all the lost science which he has uncovered in ancient texts. In the process he fails to recognize that the blueprint for prayer has been known to man ever since he was created. Humbleness before God and the filling of the Holy Spirit are the true keys to prayer - not cosmic emotions and human feelings. ---  --- A disappointing read
Ok, my kid loves it.  But, after seeing it in person, I cant believe how much I was charged for list little plastic toy.  Cost is way over excessive.  Strongly suggest saving your money, unless money is no object
Well  After I received the book I have to say I was quite disappointed because I am one of those people who gives great importance to presentation in the books .After I read the reviews I thought I was going to get a book with lots of nice photographs and various nicely set tables .It turned out that it was just like an encylopedia with lots of recipes and couple of boriiinggg pictures .If you are a visual person like me who likes to read cookbooks when you go to bed DONT BUY IT.The other important thing was that many important ingredients were missing in the greek food that was presented 
Collin has done it again.  I didn't think I'd enjoy a CD as much as his "The Walls Came Down," but "Tracks" is just great.  Every song is better than the last.  You can't go wrong with Collin Raye  and you can't find anyone with a better voice.  Buy this one
I am a huge fan of Thomas Newman but really this CD presents nothing new. It comes across as merely a re-hash of the airy, atmospheric, melody-free cues from his other recent scores. It has none of the originality of American Beauty or Road to Perdition. Frankly, as much as I like his scores, I don't think this warranted a CD release, it's just got too bland and ordinary, no matter how beautifully constructed and pristine it all sounds. A pity
I purchased this item thinking that it would make a nice gift, but upon receiving it found it looks and feels like something from a dollar store, and it's not even worth the dollar.   ---   Very cheezy item. ---  
There are no energy drink ingredients in this stuff. It's sugar water with a miniscule amount of vitamin C. --- A completely pathetic rip-off marketing hype which sadly is being sold as a troop supporting product.  --- Supporting the troops should not involve buying garbage sugar water at high prices. If you want an energy drink try Rockstar or Monster. If you want to support the troops buy a savings bond
Everything about the Sonos worked as advertised.  It was a snap to set up and it is slicker than I anticipated.  The interface is commonsense and well thought out.  It is the only decent solution for tying together multiple discrete sound systems within a house to play the same music simultaneously.  You can also play different music, all obtained from the same computer source or internet radio.   It is one of those rare products that instead of disappointing actually packs many pleasant surprises
Consider another receiver before buying Delorme's. Delorme's receiver works only with their software (the receiver does not conform to any standard, unlike most other receivers.) The Delorme software itself is not very accurate. Just in looking at the area of a few blocks surronding my home, I found 3 instances where a facility was shown as being located several blocks from where it actually is - but Microsoft had no problem locating the facilities properly. Finally, with the receiver I have, even after the device as been initialized, Delorme's software sometimes is unable to find it. (I suspect that is because the cable on the GPS side sometimes pulls slightly out, but fiddling with it doesn't seem to accomplish much). Real irritating out on the road, as it is when you find one of their printed atlas has been misbound and lacks several pages
I don't care what other reviewers say, but this bed rail sucked!!  I used it on my sons toddler bed since it seemed to be the only product that would accomodate that type of bed.  It took up so much mattress space that my son barely had room to sleep in his bed.  And it would constantly come unlocked.  And if I buy another bed rail for our next child it won't be a mesh one cause they get too dirty.  I can't remember if this cover was removable or not, if it was I'm sure it would have been a pain in the a** to remove
my five year old loves this . has the cutest songest and easiest lyrics to remember. So easy for a little kid.  Fun, Fun , Fu
I hate to rate this item poorly but it didn't work well for me. I installed it in my basement. It's hooked between two joists that are right under my living room floor, everytime I hit the heavy bag the living room sounds like someone is taking the place down. Solid product for the right location.
I bought two, one for me, one for my daughter. --- It is compact, user-friendly, it has nice sized screen. --- It comes with a charger (I've been told that some don't). --- 6.2 mgp. Video WITH audio. --- All this for a very nice price
You have sent me a model different from for the one that I asked!!!! --- I live in Chile ..... there is no way of returning it ......
well i bought these shoes after reading the good reviews it had got. And i was not to be disappointed. They are really awesome!! They are real comfy and fit perfectly for every sport i play. I even wear them to office sometimes ;) Though after wearing them for a long stretch of time, i did feel something in my right ankle but it was temporary and maybe that is why i dont want to rate it full 5 star. But they are worth every single penny i spent on them. ---  --- If you want to get good shoes which not only feel great but look good too, look no furthe
I bought this book when I had my first child.  It has provided me with alot of helpful information, especially at night or on the weekend when you're not sure whether or not to call the doctor.  I have worn my original  copy out and am about to buy a new one.  Many thanks to Dr. Neifert
I finally made my first purchase from Amazon's Unbox Video Downloads just to try the service and am happy to report a solid customer experience. For $1.99, I purchased and downloaded one of my favorite episodes of "The Twilight Zone", and it took about twenty minutes to download through a broadband connection. I don't think it's the most ideal way to see full-length motion pictures, but for a 26-minute classic TV program, I think my 17" LCD monitor makes for a suitable viewing experience, and the video quality of the downloaded file is clean. ---  --- Aired on September 15, 1961 as the show's third season opener, the episode is a Cold War fantasy appropriately called "Two" about the last two survivors on earth, a man and a woman, after an apocalyptic world war in 2109. Written and directed by TV veteran Montgomery Pittman, the simple plot revolves around the complicating fact that he is an American infantryman and she is an invading Russian soldier. Like two feral animals, they glare at each other among the debris of a deserted town destroyed by the war. He even knocks her out her after she aggressively throws pots and pans at him. The reality of their solitary existence, however, gradually dawns on them, especially after they see an evening dress in a shop window inspiring her to speak her only word of dialogue - "Prekrassnyi" - the Russian word for "lovely". ---  --- What really makes this episode memorable is the unlikely casting. Two years before she twitched her nose on "Bewitched", a brunette Elizabeth Montgomery, looking appropriately ravaged and sporting a deadly ray gun, plays the untrusting Russian soldier with surprising fierceness and vulnerability. The American is played by perennial tough-guy Charles Bronson, fresh from "The Magnificent Seven". Even though he has to spout some inane philosophical lines to describe the futility of war, he leavens his natural sullenness with a determined romanticism. They make an odd couple, but it works splendidly. I also learned that canned fried chicken will become a staple in the 22nd century. Narrated by Rod Serling in his inimitably halting manner, the show ends with my favorite line in his signature postscript: "This has been...a love story." This is classic TV
I purchased three of these units to mount in a utility trailer.  They did a great job on the trip of holding our bikes rock steady.   Very easy to get the bikes in and out of.  Great product
was a snap to put together, very soft for baby, moves with ease, takes some getting used to on putting the carseat in the stroller. but that's the only problem.
I have to give Philippa Gregory a big THANK YOU! for approaching this story from a different perspective from The Other Boleyn Girl.  It delves into the lives of those in poverty without straying far from the lavish lifestyles of English royalty and wealth.  Again I was attached to the characters and their struggles while learning much about the time period and historical events.  There were a few very alluring relationships between the narrator and the men she encounters creating a whirlwind of emotions for the reader but in the end, I was very pleased with the romantic outcome of the book.  So if you are deciding whether or not you'd like to read this after having read The Other Boleyn Girl, I greatly encourage you to do so, you won't regret it
I am very pleased with this product. It is good quality, easy to use, and well worth the money
this is an excellent product .  sturdier than most and very comfortable .  i like the back straps for carrying purposes .   would be nicer if it would recline fully .
i was really looking foward to watching this one as i have seen the box and looked at the reviews here,so i was upset when i watched this sad movie. gary graham(t.v.'s alien nation) is a robot jox,which means he pilots a large voltron like machine which are used as fighting weapons in a future where war is no longer fought! the f/x are not very good and the story is paper thin,only the acting is good,but it can't save this one from being just a let down. skip it
thoroughly enjoyed this product, have already watched it numerous times.  Highly recommend this to any chick fan
What a great idea, to make a documentary of violinist Hilary Hahn traveling around the world and concertizing.  Undoubtedly at the top of her profession, Hahn never fails to amaze with her unmistakably gorgeous tone, enviable precision, and brilliant musicality.  This DVD "portrait" includes personal footage of Hahn backstage at the Philharmonie in Berlin, as well as a tour at the Curtis Institute, a recording session at Abbey Road Studios, and a trip to Hong Kong.  In an age of music commercialism, Hahn is refreshingly real and self-deprecating.  Included on this DVD are excerpts from the Korngold Concerto, Mozart Sonata for Piano and Violin in G major, The Lark Ascending by Vaughan Williams, Chaconne from Partita in D minor by Bach, and the Paganini Concerto No. 1.  On the menu there is additional concerto footage, which includes the Korngold Concerto and Mozart sonata in their entirety - thank goodness, because there's nothing more aggravating than replaying excerpts.  If for nothing else, buy the DVD for these complete live recordings, because they are absolutely sublime.  The outer movements of the Korngold sound a lot like film music, which the classical music lover may or may not like, but the second movement is incredibly beautiful and highly recommended.  The Mozart sonata is also very well played, but this is nothing new as Hahn has already released a recording of this.  This DVD is important because it contains video footage of Hahn performing - the only other DVD where you can find her playing is The Last Night of the Proms, in which she plays the Mozart Concerto No. 4 in D Major and Presto from Sonata No. 1 by Bach, but the sound quality is somewhat lacking and certainly doesn't do justice to Hahn
The write up sounds good, with many options and features, but after closer examination I had to take it back. First thing, it appears that the front DV plug was an after-thought for Panasonic, it's a rinky-dink plastic flap on the opposite side of where the main AV/S plugs are located. This is often done at the last moment of production where they add a newer feature to an older designed unit, retro fitting it in wherever. The tiny "button within a button" toggle switch for fastforward, reverse, etc looks like it's glued on, it won't last long with normal use, and it's hard to use and in a bad place on the upper corner of the unit. The menu interface is difficult to navigate. The remote control is horrible, a real bad design for those who want to navigate quickly without looking closely at the buttons to figure out what button to push for each of the basic and most used features. You might want to pass on this one, remember the saying "if it sounds too good to be true, it probabily is
Very Comfortable and easy to use.  Very easy to fall asleep in, just make sure to tie yourself to something
I paid 99.00 for this little camcorder, thought it would be ideal for my action sports heros in the house, but we couldn't get the videos to transfer to the pc. The menu button would not bring anything up, so overall we just couldn't get this thing to work. A bummer of a christmas present
The Oral-B is a good product but the refills certainly aren't worth what they charge for them.  I don't know about you but it has always annoyed me when you get held hostage by a company to buy their refills for the item they sold you at a rip-off price.  They could make a great profit selling these refills at something like $2.50 each, their rip off price of $8.50 ea is beyond absurd.  The other thing is that when you buy their toothbrush they have something in there like the brush heads last 2 months.  That's a real laugh.  Even brushing just once a day, you're lucky if you get a month out of them.  So not only do they rip you off with their refill cost, they also lie to you to get you locked into their product to begin with
I was looking for a durable tape player for the kids and this was not it.  The microphone only worked for a couple of weeks.  It plays tapes ok but would have liked to play with the other features before they stopped functioning.  My kids are rough on toys but not that rough
We  bought two sets of the Alphabet Foam Play Mats - so glad we did!  We have a concrete basement floor, and now the kids have a nice, colorful, and soft place to play.  Plus, the foam floor isn't as cold as the concrete - wer're in Colorado.  The colors are great - so inviting.  The pieces fit together perfectly, and the border gives it a finished look.  Great purchase!  We'll probably buy more so that we can increase the size of the play area! 
I never received the product I ordered and need a refund immediately
If you're a professional photographer, you can probably ignore this review. But then you probably won't be thinking about buying this lens anyway, as you'll be off to purchase a nice L series. ---  --- However, if - like me - you just happen to have a nice Canon Digital Rebel camera (or equivalent) and enjoy taking decent pictures, this lens will probably work out very well for you. I've taken well over 1000 pictures with it in a couple of weeks, and it has performed very much as expected. For the price, it's perfect for a go-everywhere lens. ---  --- A few main points. Okay, it's not the best image quality. Even on low/medium ISO it seems a little grainy and its not as sharp as some of the more expensive Canon lenses. It struggles indoors unless you have a good flash unit, but for well-lit outdoor shoots it's works  very well. ---  --- Of course, it would be nice to have a nice L series with IS, but if you can't afford that then this is a very good value lens. Not for the real professionals, but great if you don't take things too seriously and just want a bit more zoom - and, let's face it, who doesn't want a but more zoom
I needed a big table to put my CPU, keyboard, screen and printer with room for papers and prints. The 8ft Lifetime table is perfect for my needs. It is sturdy, neat, attractive and portable. A must have for every home office. 
I had this set up in my daughter's crib when she was a baby.  It would light up the room just enough for her to feel comfortable but not so much that it kept her awake.  The music is very soothing and not as cartoony as you would think.  The unit would turn itself off after a period of time so I wouldn't have to creep back into the room hoping not to wake her. ---  --- This is a wonderful crib toy.  I would recommend it for any newborn, especially those who have a hard time falling asleep
I recently purchased this shoe after a friend of mine recommended ASICS shoes to me. This is my first pair of running shoes and I am very pleased with it. The shoes were very comfortable from the day one.  ---  --- One comment that I have about the shoe is that they are quite narrow in the front. I have wide feet and would have prefferred a little wider shoe. I worked out fine for me, however, because I had purchased 1/2 size longer than what I usually wear.  ---  --- Overall, I am very happy with this pair and would recommend it
I have tried nearly all brands of energy bars.  Hooah! are the best tasting and they give me the most energ
I really liked the outside design of the book. A lot of books were "cartoonish" and really was drawn to the look of the book. I wish the book did not have so much random fill-in pages. I had hoped that it would have blanks to fill in for different events/ages of the child. But all in all I am pleased with it. I would most likely buy again
Excellent product. Works well. --- Only problem is that the container holding water could be bigger
I think this a great product. First one lasted over a year and it runs 24/7, even in the winter
The author gives vague advice, the "calm down", "be objective" cliche  advice. If you don't believe me, I'm literally quoting him. ---  --- Although the author tries to make his book seem original, as you can read, it's not merely about imagining yourself in positive circumstances, but mixed with the generic advice I mentioned. This is not something revolutionary, this is rehash. Save your money and go imagine yourself in a positive situation, you don't need to read hundreds of pages to do it, or spend $ on what to imagine
I recently purchased this clock and it's a great little clock! The time and temp are cool features as well as the projection which is very cool and useful. The projection (usually on the ceiling) is not too bright to hurt your eyes when sleeping or awakening. ---  --- The only problem with the projection is that unless you have the clock on the side the numbers project upside down. I mean to say that if you have it facing you straight ahead the numbers will be above the clock upside down.  ---  --- The atomic feature was a bit tricky also. I live in central NJ and when setting up the clock for the first time it didn't pick up any signal. After I searched for a signal, took the batteries out and tried everything I knew and everything the manual mentioned it wouldn't get a signal. So I had to write an email to the company and they sent me a response with several suggestions, the one that worked and was most useful was to search for a signal (by pressing the down arrow) and then while its searching place it where it can recieve full signal, which is shown by the meter on the left, like a cell phone. Once you get enough signal let it sit there until it sets itself (you may need to take it outside)...this can take from 10 mins to days. In my case it took about 5 mins. So it set the signal and the company says once it sets you can put it where you want and it will keep the signal. Other than that problem, which is fixed, the clock is hassle free and very easy to use.i highly recommend it. Oregon Scientific was also helpful and I sent them a thank you email stressing that they need to put more signal suggestions in the manual, because if they did I wouldn't have needed to bother email the customer service. Hopefully most people didn't give up that easily and kept trying to get the signal to set if they didn't they may have returned the clock needlessly. ---  --- The alarm is loud enough for me to awaken and the snooze button is useful and on the top so it's can be reached easily in a drowsy stupor. ---  --- Overall it's a cute, useful, and stylish clock.
I purchased this crystal case to protect my new slvr L7.  It doesn't fit.  The case is not wide enough to fit together over the phone.  Don't waste your money.
I bought this bag for a 7 day bivouac hunt in the North Dakota Badlands. The average nightly temps were 40-50 F. The bag was warm during these windy and chilly nights. The bag compresses down reasonably small and is relatively light weight. On my second night of the hunt, I was zipping up the bag and the zipper broke right off of the bag. It didn't just come off, it literally broke. There was no way to fix this in the back country. I had my hunting buddy wrap some duct tape around me at night and then unwrap me like a giant tamalie every morning. He spent big $$$ for his bag and of course, had zero problems with it. Oh well, for the price and free shipping, this isn't too bad of a deal, just remember to bring plenty of duct tape with you.
The suction cups do not work on many toilet seats. Though the idea is great, save your money unless you have some to burn
i pruchased the 3 computer product.  I installed and have been in email tag with norton support ever since. My computer will not shutdown after installation. They have no idea why.  I have been through the same protocols over and over again for over three weeks.  I was finally told that installing version 7.02 would fix it for sure.  I did and it did not.   --- I was also told that unlike other products such as webroot, when you buy a three ciomputer pack, then expiration date is tied to installation on the first computer. If the three computers do not have the same installation date-like mine -i had 2006 installed on three computers which were put on at different times-you can lose the value of the subscription.  When I called Norton customer service -i get the reply that what can you expect we gave you a bargain-about 70 on a three computer deal.  The service was rude and not helpful.  I asked why it did not say anthing on the box or in the manual and was told that was my proble,
The daughter of a prominent Boston doctor is dead, apparently from a botched abortion (which was illegal in the late 60's).  Dr. John Berry's friend, Art Lee, is in jail for the crime, which he says he didn't commit.  So, Dr. Berry sets out to prove his friend's innocence, and runs into cover-ups and lots of secrets.  But there are many doubts, such as was the girl really pregnant, and did Dr. Lee actually perform the surgery, and why is Dr. Berry so interested in finding the culprit? ---  --- For Michael Crichton's first novel, it's not bad, but nowhere near as good as some later ones.  The plot is marginally interesting, but it was hard to keep characters straight and the dialog didn't sound very natural.  Dr. Berry (who just takes the whole work week off to investigate) talks more like a cheesy "private eye" than a doctor.  Also annoying was the use of footnotes and endnotes to explain various medical terms and concepts - nice to know but annoying to look up
I purchased this hair dryer for an unusual reason:  my old 1875 watt Conair was actually too much wattage for my bathroom (the circuit kept tripping), so I was actually looking for a dryer with LESS wattage.  However, I didn't want to sacrifice power, as I hoped not to have to devote any additional drying time to my shoulder-length hair. ---  --- So far, I've been pleased with this hair dryer.  It does seem a bit louder than my previous model--not obnoxiously so, just a higher, more concentrated fan noise.  The dryer is extremely light and compact; it's actually smaller than my folding travel dryer.  It is very basic, with a choice of high/low settings only (there is no heat/cool option), but it seems to dry my hair just as efficiently as my old higher-wattage dryer.   ---  --- Overall, this is a very good basic hair dryer which gives you a wide variety of use options for a great price
The POWER-2000 XP-333 charges batteries in pairs, with one LED per pair, not as described.  The XP-555 charges each battery independently and slightly faster (3 vs 4 hours).  The XP-333 charger is very lightweight, the XP-555 is slightly heavier.   They work on 110 or 220 V and includes plug adaptors for round European type plugs.  I have used the XP-333 in the USA and overseas.  POWER-2000 makes several other charger models as well.   ---  --- The XP-333 and 555 AAs are 2500 mAh, and there are XP-33327 and XP-55527 versions now available with 2700 mAh batteries.  AAA batteries charge faster as they hold less charge.  AAAs from Power-2000 currently come in 850 and 1000 mAh capacities.   ---  --- I believe that these capacities for AA and AAA from POWER-2000 and other NiMH makers are twice as great or maybe more than alkalines.  As I recall, some years ago Duracell copper top AAs have 1100 mAh.  I have not found recent figures on the web, but got the old figure by calling the 800 number on the Duracell packages.  Duracell Ultras appear to have a bit higher mAh figure, but I do not know that that is.   ---  --- The 1.2 V for NiMH vs 1.5 V for alkalines seems to make no practical difference as I am told, and I believe it is correct, that alkaline voltage drops rapidly under 1.5 V after initial use while I understand that the NiMH holds its 1.2 V value for some time. 
I usually wear a men's medium waist for athletic shorts (Umbro, Adidas, Nike) and they usually fall just above my knee lengthwise.  Just to be safe I ordered a large.  The shorts barely made it past the midpoint of my thigh and my legs aren't overly long.  The waist fits well but if you're looking for a pair of workout shorts, I'd skip these unless you like to show a lot of leg. 
This was a stocking stuffer for Christmas.  My Grandson loved it and it is performing well
This was the most disgusting diet product I've tried.  I love marshmallow dip, and this wasn't even close to tasting like it.  It has a chemical taste, like you're eating spun plastic, and makes you actually scared to eat it.  Why even bother eating it.  I'll stick with fat free whipped topping -- at least it has flavor
This compass is better than I thought it would be especially for the price.  It's a great deal.  I purchased it for a car and it work well for it
Allright, thuis gun is so much more than i was hoping for. its accurate, and its an incredible price. its pretty hard hitting. i was putting holes in a cardboad box from 50 feet away. --- im not new to airsoft, and i really wish that my first gun was as nice as this one --- if you take it out to have a little fight with your friends, i reccommend extra clips. --- the mag capacity is about 45, and the load time is annoyingly long --- a very good gun for all abilitie
I wear this shirt waiting tables and I reccomend it to anyone.  When washed it is wrinkle free and can survive many washings.  The larger size is very roomy and sleeve length is appropriate for long arms.  I only wish it came in a broad collar instead of just a point color, but still an excellent shirt
These should not be confused with dessert.  As the name states, these are a breakfast cookie, originally developed for people in a hurry who do not stop for a cooked meal.  This variety has chocolate chunks but is not a chocolate cookie.  Other varieties are available.  Cookie varieties are based on the original recipe.  They are available in the full 3 ounce size, or as mini-cookies.  They have a good nutritional balance.  They do have an expiration date.  Like all bakery products, they do not stay fresh forever.  As other reviewers have warned, you need to check the expiration date, especially if you are not buying them direct from the bakery.  Day old bread is also sold at bargain prices, but you get day old bread.  I found that the fresh cookies are yummy and they do fill you up.  I would recommend them for your travel bags (better than airline food which has often been reduced to yucky box lunches), for your desk drawer if you get busy and have to skip lunch, or for a convenient trail food if you are hiking.  I used the Rocky Road variety (seasonal special) in Christmas stockings and the pumpkin variety (seasonal special) in Halloween bags
I love these!  They are such a good deal for the price, and come in a nice box.  They are much better than what I was expecting. : )  Colours are a nice pastel, and would go with lots of different things.  Pearls are large but not too large - just right
Attempted to upgrade from 97 to 2003... bad move... none of my access 97 programs work now... in fact I, I brought home a 2003 access database from work to see if it was an incampatibility problem between the two versions... nope... the upgrade just didn't work.....had to purchase a full version to set things right... save your money on this product..
Poor product.  No strap comes with this case.  Too difficult to get the iPod out for updates, whilst trying to pull out iPod can be dropped.  Front view cover is smeary and scratched.  Buttons are difficult to re-snap.  No need for other voting on this --just a poor product
My daughter at U of M got me interested in the Rwandan crisis and was just vacationing in Canada and picked up this book by a Canadian General who was leading the UN effort in Rwanda during the genocide and what a tragedy this  was and remains. I didnt walk away thinking this guy was a great General but he had the guts and the commitment to right to stay in spite of the ineptitude of the United Nations and Cofi Anan who was in a key role at the time. The tragedy of what the free world stood by and let happen is nearly unsurpassed, probably only by the Jews extermination in WWII. If you have any interest in the world happenings and think you have faith in the United Nations just buy this and read it - we need change.
With no mode settings(repeat, shuffle, etc) or shock protection, this cd player is pretty undesirable, but if you're just looking for something to hold you over then this'll do. It has all the basic features of a cd player of course and it works alright. It could be with just mine, but every pair of headphones, new and old, that I use with it, the left begins to malfunction although when using those same headphones in another cd player or speakers, they work fine. Like I said, if you just want a temporary thing then I guess this is good for you
Hasta este momento ha sido una experiencia muy favorable, pues el reloj ha funcionado perfectamente y el tiempo de entrega estuvo dentro de mis expectativas. --- 
I had been using my air conditioning vents to hold my XM radio and this was recommended to me through a friend.  It's super easy to install and works great.  It doesn't move or shake while driving and is adjustable height wise to fit most car setups.  It was well worth the money and in the summer heat, I am glad I bought it and got my extra air conditioning vent back
I like the fact that Kidsline offers extra crib sheets to go with the Zanzibar theme and am impressed with the quality of these sheets (I have two, one came with the bedding set and one was purchased off my baby registry) . They wash extremely well (still looks new), are soft and fit the mattress appropriately. However, I think $16.99 for a crib sheet is a bit pricey and have purchased other crib sheets that match the theme and are just as nice. (Amy coe, sage green at Target for $8.99 and koala baby sage green for $9.99 at BRU).  Since you need several crib sheets, I just don't feel the price is worth it for this one.
Just to warn you, this product does not come with a USB cable and it doesn't work with most laptops I have had.  You need a desktop for this product and the website for the product is not very helpful at all.  The ecaddy is great, but the caddylink is next to worthless
This movie helps brings to life what you have read in the Bible about John and future world events. You must see this movie
Having read Detective Comics #471-479 in the 70s done by this same creative team, I picked this up, hoping for more of the same. What a let-down!  ---  --- I have to ask - What Happened!? ---  --- The art on those erstwhile 70s issues was the finest, most detailed art I'd ever seen in a comic-book. I think that was due mostly to the inking of Terry Austin. When he was working on X-Men, he gave John Bryne's pencils that fine detail as well. ---  --- Has Austin done a 'Gil Kane' and given up his nib-and-ink to work with marker-pen? This Dark Detective series shows none of the fine-ness of his previous work. You only have to compare the 'flash-backs' of this series to the original Detective Comics issues to see that something is wrong. ---  --- Maybe Austin or Rogers are getting older, but the artwork is very basic, and lacks the sheen they used to produce. The art sometimes actually reminded me of Bob Kane's early work. ---  --- The story also is a little unbelievable. It portrays Bruce as a love-sick puppy and just doesn't ring true.  ---  --- Also, the lettering is - well, it's been hand-done, by Rogers I surmise, and is quite uneven. It should have been done by computer. ---  --- I'm sorry - I SO wanted to like this, but it's nothing like the calibre of work that this creative team produced in their glory days of the 70s. 
We bought two of these.  We were very impressed how easy the set up was. ---  --- Since installing the weather station - we have enjoyed the accuracy of the weather station both inside and outside temperatures. ---  --- One feature of this weather station is a ice alert.  Up here in north we do get freezing rain ice, and snow.  This station has been right on the --- button with those predictions. ---  --- I would highly recommend the purchase
I cant believe there are so many positive ratings given to this sub-par Testament release.  Testament must have taken hints from Metallica and tried to attract a different audience.  This is not a horrible album, but compared to any other Testament album, it is easily their worst.  Only the die-hard Testament fan, or those into commercial metal should pick this up.   --- 
I used the Remington twice up to now, and the bottom line it is a great machine, you will never need to lube it, and that is a big deal with clippers. its easy to clean, sharp and easy to work with
I agree with "music fan" about this CD. Eden is a good album, and she's a good artist. But either this album was poorly produced or something, because this does not show her best. I wouldn't classify this as world music at all, because the instruments aren't used and it's more classical pop; if that's a genre. It seemed rambly to me with many of the songs sounding similar and lacking originality. I love her, she's unique in her genre. But she really shines as a classicist, with Classics, her work by Andrew Lloyd Webber (who she married) and operatic albums. This is what she's best at, so her collaborations on Eden and La Luna, which are classical in nature but still allowed her to branch out musically, turned out good. I have a lot of her albums, but I wouldn't buy this one. It's more something to listen to once. A few of the songs are good, the album isn't terrible, but it's not very good
 The black of this is the same as on my camera, and with all the parts together, this is one professional looking set up! ---  I am not sure if this hood cuts down on glare/reflection, as I have not used it on a sunny day, but I don't see why it shouldn't. ---  And as cheap as this little product is, it is pretty much a must have with this camera! (S3 IS) ---  ---  One last side note, should you alreay own a extra lens or two. And they happen to be metal, be VERY carful about screwing them into this plastic adaptor! I made that mistake and had to put the whole thing in the fridge for an hour, so the metal would shrink, and I could get the pieces apart
This armband provides good protection to the nano via a skin that the nano slides into and a rigid clear protector that fits over the screen (stays in place by pressure from the skin pressing down on rubberized edges of the protector).  ---  --- It works well for jogging and working out. The neoprene (better than leather for sweaty workouts) armband fits well on my upper arm (6' 200lb) and seems pretty adjustable to other size arms. It is a bit awkward to silde the nano into the skin while keeping the screen protector in place. I first began sliding the nano into the armband mount but found that difficult to keep the screen protector in place so I now just clip it in which seems to work fine. It has tried to come loose from the armband a couple of times but I think this was due to not ensuring the nano was fully seated into the armband.  ---  --- I have only used the armband for about 3 weeks now and I am satisfied at this point, I am only giving 4 stars due to the screen protector being scuffed out of the package and there could have been better documentation included. Also on another note, apple should have centered the hold button on the top of the nano because almost all protectors I have seen make it somewhat difficult to access the button and this one is no exception. The button is next to the upper left edge and any decent protector has to almost cover this area to work properly.  ---  --- All in all you will be satisfied with the armband and remember for the price your are getting a skin for everday protection of the nano and a good armband also so it's a solid value.
I do not have any recolection of purchasing this product, nor can I find it on my computer or in any of my hard non computer files. I have always ordered a hard disk back up of all purchases from Zone Alarm. There is no hard disk no Computer file. I am about to raise you Know what about this charge on my credit card. I will challenge it if I do not receive for what I am being charged. I will also ask My credit card Co. for a new number to prevent future charges from these folks. In the future I will use a third party encryted method for purchases on the internet.  rehadik@netscape  
Van Dyke Parks did the arrangements on Sam Phillips's debut 'The Indescribable Wow', an album I love so much I thought I'd give 'Song Cycle' a shot. ---  --- What a feeerocious disappointment! I'd give it zero stars if I could, but amazon wouldn't let me! ---   --- My god, that singing voice of his reminds me of David Bowie... "The Laughing Gnome" Bowie, that is... I've seen the word "coy" pop up in a lot of reviews to describe his singing, er, style, but I'll go them all one better... "smug". All I hear in it is "Ooh, I'm so smart. What a clever lad am I."  ---  --- The arrangements or orchestrations, or whatever you call them are all pointless. It gives me the feeling that Van's dad bought him an orchestra and said, "Here, son, have fun." So young Van did... without ever really learning how to use it properly. Randy Newman KNOWS how to use an orchestra; check out his best album 'Sail Away'. The arrangements are tasteful and, key word here, SPARE. He never clubs us over the head with them.  ---  --- The lyrics, if we can call them such, have no attachment whatsoever to the music.... but then again since I wrote that the arrangments are pointless I guess it's to be expected. --- So, what we have is a trifecta of awfulness: bad voice, bad lyrics, and bad music. ---  --- HOWEVER, he did make 'Song Cycle' in 1968 and worked on 'The Indescribable Wow' in 1988... so he did learn a thing or two in 20 years, namely that arrangements are NOT songs; they're used to highlight a certain verse or chorus the singer really wants to put across to the listener... maybe Randy pulled him aside once to tell him that...
Wow!!! I bought this set a couple of months ago and I've been watching each episode little by little, and enjoying each one of them a lot!!! It's interesting to watch Captain Scarlet again, thirty-something years after the last time I watched it back in the late 60s (when I was 7 or 8 years old)! ---  --- I was (and still am) a huge fan of the "Thunderbirds" and became quite delighted when this new series from Gerry Anderson first appeared on TV back in the 60s! The quality of Captain Scarlet's special effects obviously got better since the Thunderbirds, and it really makes a huge difference (as far as realism is concerned) to have the marionettes more realistically proportioned! So much so, that there are times when you can almost forget that they are marionettes! ---  --- The production still looks fabulous after all these years! The design of vehicles, machines, personal equipment, weapons, buildings, etc. is quite enjoyable, interesting and sometimes even surprising! The "Angels" (both airplanes and pilots) still manage to look amazingly sharp and contemporary!!! Perhaps only the automobiles give you a hint of the series real age, for they look quite dated indeed! However, now it seems a bit funny to see 1965 Chrysler and Ford lookalikes among the futuristic modernism of the series! ---  --- Thirty-something years later, most of the episodes plots seem a bit shallow, almost stupid! But one has to remember that this series was meant for children! So, once you remember this you'll be ready to have a great time watching Captain Scarlet and his fellow Spectrum buddies fight the evil Mysterons (led by the sinister looking Captain Black), just as you did when you were still a child! ---  --- Spectrum is green!!!...Enjoy it!!
This game has StarForce copy protection, which is software that you do not want on your computer. Reportedly, it replaces your CD and/or DVD drivers, and often causes extreme hardware and software problems. I've been a victim of the software problems, it basically crippled my very expensive SCSI scanners and it was extremely difficult to figure out what was doing it. It could be the best game that's ever been produced, but anyone who's had the StarForce experience is going to steer clear
We had the Royal for about 8 months, used it sparingly and made sure not to overload it the it stopped working.  We read reviews prior to purchase and it was recommended then to find other reviews now that support our experience.  Stay away from this shredder.  --- 
This storage bench is great for storing pool items or anything you keep outside.  It was easy to put together and I got it on the Friday sale for $69.99, so the price was awesome!  All other benches like this that I researched were over $100.0
Warmth from window affects thermometer! D'oh! It's totally inaccurate on single-pane glazing, very inaccurate on dual-pane glazing, and still slightly inaccurate when mounted on a jerri-rigged 6" extender from dual-pane glass. The nature of windows being a big source of heat loss means this thermometer is measuring *warm* ambient air, not actual outside temperature
I own both Blu-ray and HD-DVD movies, and have been consistently dissapointed with all the HD-DVD's.  They just don't compare to Blu-ray.  The Hulk was not a very good movie to begin with, and the transer to HD-DVD was not impressive.  Picture quality was average at best, and the sound quality was also mediocre.  I have yet to find any HD-DVD that is even comparable to the best of Blu-ray
 I bought one pair of shoes and returned them, they were to large. Bought another pair and hoped that I would adjust to the shoe, I haven"t. I have worn the shoes now and can not return them. I plan to give them away to someone they may fit. I will never order shoes again, I learned my lesson.I agree with the other review good quality in the manufacturing poor design as far as the size.I believe rockport made a mistake with the size and fit and thats why they are being sold for a discounted price. I will go to a shoe depatment and try on the shoes before I buy, as I have in the past
I love this product.  Unfortunately, I blew mine up in West Africa (my computer was not damaged), so when I returned I ordered another right away.  I wish that it were a little thinner, but I suppose you can't have everything....at least right now
We loved this pair of sneakers for my 22 mo. old so much that we bought it in the next size up so that we/he could keep using them. They are so easy to get on him, and we all know some are SO difficult. These slide right on while pulling the tongue. They are also wide enough for his "flinstone" feet, lol. They break in well for flexibility too.
By far... the best, no after tastes and will not spike your blood surgar levels, worth every penny
Surprisingly decent sound for something in this price range!  And loud enough to fill an ordinary room with sound; hard to believe it runs off of a 9-volt battery.  You can also plug in a Walkman headset.  In contrast, the Pocket Rock-It costs more and is headset-only; no loudspeaker.  The three knobs on top are volume, tone, and distortion.  It comes with a fresh battery and it has a belt clip so you can wear it.  It's a good value and takes up very little space.  I kinda like the nostalgic pastel colors, like a blast from the past
They could not be any smaller, the diamonds or the earrings.  I should have known better
I buy this at Sam's Club for about $12/2#. Before I became enlightened re: organic products, I was a Folgers user. This coffee is a deeper roast and has a higher acid level, but is flavorful. For the price this is an incredible deal
Ok, I'll admt it. When I first saw this movie, I was only 6 or 7. I thought it dumb and pointless.I also thought 'OMFG! What was that teacup thing for? it was soooooo pointless. This movie is stupid.' Now I am 13, and i saw it again on ABC family. Then, I thought 'WOW!' this movie is so cool! I then understood what theteacups represented and everything. I thought it was a great movie. Truely hilarious too. Of course, it does teach a sort of lesson about surviving in the world. But I never found it until now. This is a very cute movie and I really think anyone can enjoy it
I received my order today, and discovered (as with all of the Hasa products in my order) that although more than one item is pictured--  only one comes with the order.  The item itself is very small, 2 1/2" X 1".  That, fine, I can accept since the cost was under two dollars and since the item is made of wood, lifesize would make play a work-out for most children. However, shipping only one without a clear statement that each order is for ONE item and does not include all the items in the photograph is false advertising
This movie has such wonderful reviews from both professional critics and Amazon customers that I was expecting great things. While I agree the acting (especially the girls playing Christy and Ariel) is excellent the story is just too implausible and I got that impression from the minute we see the family crossing from Canada to the US (yes they are Irish but for some reason they have to sneak in to the US from Canada). Anyway why on earth would an apparently intelligent couple enter the US with their two kids illegally, without jobs or much money to settle in the most expensive city in the country?  I know the dad is an actor but couldn't he have settled the family in one of the less expensive boroughs and taken the subway in to Manhattan? The mom is a teacher but can't find a job but no wonder if they are in the country illegally. Yet there is money for private school, fixing up the dump of an apartment, an expensive camcorder, betting the rent money on an ET doll etc.  I can't imagine any parents moving in to an apartment building known as the "drug house" with two young girls and then letting the girls wander about as they please.  Mind you the parents are a couple supposedly almost crippled by the guilt they feel over a third child - a son - that has recently died.  I kept expecting someone to call Social Services.   And the medical situations with both Frankie and the mom and new baby are not well thought out or researched. The symbolism between Mateo, the new baby and Frankie is very heavy handed. Though the film is told through the oldest daughter's eyes  because of several scenes and elements the movie is not suited at all to children.  And there are also several scenes that are really not connected with the oldest daughter at all.   Maybe if I had taken it more as a fable I would have "gotten" this movie more but I was expecting a straight forward drama and was disappointed.
This nail polish is by far the best nail product I have ever purchased! I stumbled accross it in France two summers ago and have been dying to find it ever since. The brush is great, depositing the polish smoothly and thinly, the product dries quickly and lasts a long time. It is AMAZING
I love the Olay Regenerist line! Moisturizes your skin and makes it smooth. You will see a big difference after the first use! I've been using this product for 2 years now and just recently started the serum and it's great.
Fantastic collection of all areas of graphic design. A must for the reference library
Great errings. I got these for my 12 y.o. neice but decided they were too long for her, but loved them for myself, very cute
With five kids under the age of 9 and four Leapsters in the house, there is rarely a time when someone isn't playing one (if not all!) of them. We have about 10 of the cartridges, and this was the most disappointing (followed closely by Spiderman). There simply isn't enough for them to do with it. The beauty of the Leapster is the ability to interact with the games, and learn while they do it. Watching a video on a 2 inch screen just doesn't cut it.
This is by far one of the very best musicals ever made. Kathryn Grayson and Howard Keel displays Oscar worthy performances as Lilli and Fred. Sadly, this was Grayson`s last MGM film and she did only 1 more(at Paramount - The Vagabond King with Oreste).  ---  --- In KISS ME KATE she shows us a depth and nuance and is right on target the whole picture through. Audrey Hepburn won that year`s Oscar for Roman Holiday - but Miss Grayson should deservedly have won it. --- The same goes for Howard Keel. True, he is hammy at times - but it is a remarkable performance he gives(Mind u - he was a musical star). William Wolden`s Oscar for Stalag 17 should have gone to Mr Keel. ---  --- That`s Entertainment and its sequels payed deservedly homage to producer Arthur Freed and his genius in selecting and delegating crew and performers to the right project were uncanny. --- Yet you shouldn`t negletct Jack Cummings who produced this film, Seven Brides For Seven Brothers and Three Little Words(to name but a few). It seems to me that MGM had an "MGM-look!" Can u really tell the MGM films from 1930-1960 apart and say which 1 was the director? Not really, unless u are Hitchcock or Fritz Lang.  ---  --- What I mean to say that it`s high time Cummings, Joe Pasternak og Sol C. Sigel comes out of the cold and are giving honours for their splendid musical efforts(Bathing Beauty, Anchors Aweigh, In the Good Old Summertime, Summer Stock, The Great Caruso, Hit The Deck and High Society etc). ---  --- I must also pay may respects to Tommy Rall(soon 2 be one of the brothers in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers); he is a dancer`s dream come true:-
Every house should have a Grundig S350 Deluxe. Big, brawny, "grabbing" in all the hard-to-get stations with ease, championing a big antenna that says this radio means serious business, the Grundig S350 Deluxe version, is a bigger, better version of the old Grundig S350, eliminating some of the "drift" problems of the earlier model. The speaker on the Deluxe is bigger and brighter. Whereas your fancy digital preset radios often sound like tin, the Grundig S350 DL has depth. Is it a perfect radio? No. You don't have presets in spite of the digital read-out. You get a little AM overload. Here in Los Angeles I get overload on 1150 so that I'm listening to two shows at once. Also the cheaper (and cheaper built) GE Superradio boasts an internal AM ferrite antenna twice the size and as a result gets slightly better AM. ---  --- If you're looking for a radio with similar features as the Grundig S350 DL but erases its weakness--no presets and AM overload, then you might want to check out the Grundig G4000A. It's the same price as the S350 and its speaker is surprisingly good for a digital preset shortwave radio. Or you might look at the stunning Kaito 1103 or its more expensive cousin the Eton E5. But even if you get a fancy preset radio, every house should have the big easy-to-use Grundig S350 Deluxe. ---  --- Update: Comparing the S350 to the same-priced G4000 for several months, it becomes clear that the G4000 is a better buy: superior AM, superior separation of AM stations, presets, same warm speaker, and smaller.
In theory this is a nice set, and I like all of the different tools -- but I bought this as a gift, and I'm going to return it.  It just looks too cheap.  The wooden handles are chipped in some places, there's almost no finish on them, and the plastic case is really flimsy and cheap looking.  Perhaps if I was buying them for myself I wouldn't mind, but I'd be embarrassed to give this as a gift
These shoes make my feet look so tiny but they are so cute!  I wore them with jeans and will wear them with a pencil skirt next week. Turns out Jessica makes pretty good shoes.........CUTE!!!
Very beautiful pearls. There are visible blemishes, which makes them appropriate to wear at work without me feeling overdressed. The uniformity is very good. All pearls are more or less same size. Beautiful clasps too. However I have to agree with the previous reviewer that it is hard to handle without help, especially the bracelet. Took me about 10 minutes to put it on my wrist. The color is slightly yellowish. The shape is good: kinda semiround rather than potato. They'll make great gifts.
Add a can of chick peas/garbonzo beans and you can give this entree 6 stars. Makes it look a bit more appealing, too
I wanted to mainly write this to address the shipping complaints below.  We are redoing our deck and expanding it, and after research thought this would be the best buy for a durable product.  After reading the shipping complaints, we put it on order right away- expecting to have it in the several weeks it would take for the deck.  Lo and behold- 3 days later they call my wife and ask to deliver it- any 4 hour window she wants- she picks the next morning and the next day when i get home there are 4 giant boxes in my garage spot when i get home.  They are huge boxes, and double boxed, but luckily no styrofoam- still i had to take all the cardboard to the recycling center myself, but at least very little was not recycleable.  Our deck is still not done, so i can make little comment other than that the one i did set up in the living room seems study- the cushion is very thick and well made- but stiff- which may be the comment noted below (I assume he goes for very soft).  I find it comfortable, but may comment more when we have actually used them a bit.  Still given the shipping concerns noted is several comments, I wanted to point out that if you have someone who can be home for a four hour window- it seems to be no problem.
I was first introduced to this tea at Starbucks. They marketed it as Shaken Passion Tea. It tastes great when served hot, but when iced, it really shines. ---  --- Bear in mind that this is a herabl infusion and not a traditional tea. The color is a deep ruby red and the taste....it is indescribable. When served slightly sweet with a spring of mint it is the perfect summer refresher. ---  --- If you want a break from traditional black or green teas or are watching your caffeiene intake this is the perfect subsitution
The sneakers are great.  My son loves the wheels on the side
Who in the world called this ''Hard Rock''?!???????????!!? This is a bunch of self-pitying, mainstream jibberish..nothing interesting at all. I shall dub this as ''Alternative Whine''.
I'm very disappointed with this magazine.  It seems to be a total waste of money.  I found one article that was somewhat helpful and sometimes 2-3 pictures in each issue that give me some style ideas, but it's not worth the money or my time digging through it trying to find something I can use. 
First of all it took like 2 weeks for then gun to get to me. 2 weeks later....the piston broke so its not a high quality airsoft gun. But it looks cool and its worth the price
Birkenstocks are a great thing for my diabetic feet.  I found this particular model to be a bit narrow to my liking
I bought this set for use with my second child. It helps to have more bottles around when she needed to go to daycare and I needed to pump. I use the bottles and different nipples to feed her and then use the bottles from this set to pump with. She did not take to the nipples that came with this set--but they are very nice and if she had it would have been perfect. The bottle hold 6 oz so once your baby is taking more than 6 oz you would not be able to use them to feed with. Overall---I am so happy with the Medela bottles and pump!!
I hate this doll!  She is difficult to program, eats batteries and the tags which must be plugged into her body do not like to stay attached.  Within a week her hair was a matted mess, it took me an hour to brush out the tangles and is now braided.  I would not recommend this doll to anyone.  With all the frustration this doll has caused I would love to turn it into a shooting target
If you want your hair to feel like it has day old elementary school vanilla pudding in your hair then this is a 5 star product for ya!  If you like your hair clean and nice, pass on this.  I tried this, and my god anything I rested my head on; chairs, car seats, pillows, my boyfriend, my child! was left with a greasy gooey stain on it.  Seriously  I think this stuff is going to cost me more in cleaning bills then anything else I have ever used on my body.  And I still have the original hair damage in my dern hair!!!  Maybe if he had killed an animal or 2 for this product I would not be left with this mess. 
The Firm(a conglomerate consisting of Nas, AZ, Foxy Brown and the relative unknown Nature(who took the place of original member Cormega after a heated dispute))...came up with the "brilliant idea" to collaborate on a full album...after the release of "Affirmative Action" from Nas' It Was Written album.  After enlisting the assistance of Dr. Dre's Aftermath Records and production by the infamous Trackmasters,  The Firm's album is subpar to say the least...it sounds like each individual artists is trying too hard to outshine the other and many of the beats consisting on this album are just a lil too sample heavy...."Hardcore" for example.  However, I will admit, there are some shining moments by all four members....and some half decent production....i.e. "Phone Tap"..."F**k Somebody Else"(lyrics are forgettable since Foxy is doing what she does best on the mic...talking about sex and its many forms....I think you might be able to masterbate to this one...LOL).  I will give this a decent try but I can't go no further than that.  I will agree with one reviewer saying that listening to the group as solo artists is a more satisfying
This book would not be helpful for children of faiths other than Christianity
I owned this camera for almost two years before someone stole it from me, and I said "THANK YOU!" because I hated the thing.  I used to have a 4mp Samsung and it was better than this one.   ---  --- The worst problem: Slow.  Slow slow slow.  If you use the flash, be prepared to wait 4-8 seconds before being able to take the next picture.  It's worse at low battery strength, but even with fresh batteries it was tedious. ---  --- The other thing that disappointed me was the color.  The light from the flash is glaring and unnatural, and without the flash everything is reddish, grainy, and blurry.  I never found a decent middle ground.  I take a lot of pictures indoors and at low light, and my Samsung wasn't great but it was better than this one.  When I look at the pictures I've uploaded on my computer, I can see the difference when my old camera died and I got the Nikon. ---  --- The worst thing about owning this camera was occasionally borrowing someone else's camera and wishing I owned THAT one. ---  --- Do some research before you make a mistake like I did. I've heard similar things from others who owned the same camera
We've used artificial Christmas trees for years and every year we've taken off the ornament, etc and broken the tree down for storage.  This year we ordered the Christmas Tree Bag.  This year, we took off the stand and set the entire tree, ornaments and all in the bag.  Only about a foot of the "trunk" stuck out after zipping up.  Where has this bag been all these years?  Next year we'll unzip, put on the stand, and set up the tree.  Plug in the lights and away we go
I put this item on my Christmas wish list....I didn't realize just how large and lovely and superior in quality it would be compared to others on the market! I've never seen a mortar and pestle like this before. It is top quality and a 'treat' to own and use
Amazon.com has listed this as the "King's Quest Compilation" instead of the "King's Quest Collection" which is clearly printed on my box for the game, as well as the picture on the website. I don't know why that is. ---  --- As for the game itself, I remember loving the King's Quest games when I was younger. I bought this game mostly for "King's Quest VI" which so far has seemed to work fine, with the exception of one time when the game kicked me out for no apparent reason. This particular version of "King's Quest VI" also seems to draw it's graphics from the original release of the game and not the CD release later on, so that was also somewhat disappointing. Captain Saladin no longer looks like Lassie. ---  --- Overall, it's nice to have access to these games for nostalgia
When I got ordered these shoes, I was so excited because the picture looked so nice. Do not be deceived by its looks. I saw it in another store, and I tried it on for fun. The shoe fits poorly, and its actually really ugly. I would definitely not reccomend it to any one
They have made several changes - some good, most bad -  since I bought my last Sony handicam in 8/2003.  First of all, there is no carrying strap.  This is very inconvenient if you plan to use your hand for anything else except for holding your camera.  I managed to jury rig one but it is a royal pain. The docking station is just one more thing to have to carry and when you want to upload your mini cassettes to your computer, you have to take the camera off the docking station to change cassettes. This messes up my editing program.  Fortunately I still have my old camera.  The ability to take still shots is better - more megapixels - but not good enough to zoom in or enlarge.  ---  --- While I was told most people prefer to use the LED screen (I don't knoiw why as it eats up more power and you can't see clearly in bright sun) I like to use the viewfinder.  It no longer has a tilt up feature so I end up mashing the battery into my cheek. ---  --- This last complaint is about the batteries. Sony LIED about the amount of time that a battery will hold.  The 5 hour battery only charges to 194 minutes on my camera. That's slightly more than 3 hours; It is nowhere near 5 hours.  The 7 hour battery does not get anywhere near 7 hours either. Their packages should be accurate.   All in all, It is not as good as the older product.  There also should be a setting to stop it from running if the rec. button is not being pushed.   THIS WILL BE MY LAST SONY UNLESS THEY MAKE MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS
This 3 Piece Combo is a good purchase.  The chargers might feel a little light weight or cheap but they work never the less and the case is of good quality.  For the price,  you can not beat it
This book expounds endlessly on how best to limit the impact of people on the backcountry in the very best traditions of the Sierra Club.  It's more of a philosophy book than a "how to" book.  If anyone wants to  learn how to backpack and/or camp, he would be better advised to buy the  several books by Karen Berger and Chris Townsend, in particular The  Backpackers Handbook
I bought one of these, based from a review. I pretty much agree with her, the machine is great and it gives a good workout. But she forgot to mention, the thing can cause your feet to get sore! I tried wearing high quality running shoes and it still hurt. I received an advice to attatch foam strips to the runners that you stand on, and that has solved the problem! So far, I have not used the pistons, so it's just a cardio workout. I have Tony's tapes he sells on his website and his music cd's, and I do get a very good workout! I have lost 13 pounds so far by using it, and I noticed it defanitely toned up the buns
Remember Spirograph by Kenner you played with as a kid? This thing Hasbro sells under the same name is NOT that toy. It is obviously of cheap quality, parred down to a handful of "gears", and designed so poorly that it doesnt really work! Stick with the original, which means purchase it used on eBay, but do NOT buy Hasbro's Spirograph.
I have used Tax Cut for several years.  Have had no complaints.  It is easy to use and is very complete.  Plan to use it again next year
The Cold Steel Spike Tanto is a lot of knife for a reasonable price. ---  --- It is viciously sharp and will remove arm hair quite easily.  It has a width across the spine of the blade that is unmatched by any knife its size I have ever seen.  Virtually indestructible.  The case is excellent if plain.  This knife leaves very wide wounds in steak; I think stitches would be the only way to close the wounds. ---  --- On the down side it doesn't hold an edge very long and its handle is very short and I wear a medium glove. ---  --- Overall this is a knife built for the sole purpose of self defense.  It is small to make it easily concealable and comes with its own neck chain.  It is a knife that won't let you down when the going gets tough, used in its intended purpose it should be virtually indestructible and wickedly efficient.   
Can't say enough about how great this record is. It still stands the test of time by remaining relevant. "Summerland," and "Mission Man" are my personal favs, but the whole album deserves raves
I was happy at the appearance of the bag, but was extremely disappointed in the smell of the backpack.  I received it around Christmas time and have had it hanging outside since hoping to air out the smell.  It still smells making it unable to use
Call it American folk, call it alt.country, call it what you like, but if you heard this Aussie trio on CBS or NPR earlier this week, suffice to say their in a category all their own.  Love that harmonica.  Up All Night by the Waifs is appropriately titled.  I'll be up all night listening to it
My bedroom receives an inordinate amount of morning light and, being a light sleeper, I've tried numerous ways to protect my slumber. It doesn't help that my husband (God love him) snores as loud as a small jet plane. I've tried silicone ear plugs and satin eye masks only to find that the plugs make me feel like I have a head cold and the masks leave unwanted gaps that let in the light. ---  --- I received the Tranquility Zone eye mask for a birthday present and I could hardly wait to try it. I LOVE this thing! It's thick and large enough to block out all of the light and, due to the design, the mask is positioned perfectly over my ears. The sounds are pleasant (I'm a big fan of the "Babbling Brook" track) and I love being able to plug my mp3 player in so I can listen to my own nature-sounds tracks, too.  ---  --- I've given this 5 stars because there's no option for 4.5. In all honesty, there are a few drawbacks. First, when I say this is thick I'm not kidding. Without my A/C in the summer it might get a bit warm. Second, the sound clips themselves are on very short loops... so if you have a brain like mine that tunes in to what you're hearing you'll notice that the clip repeats itself every 5 seconds or so. Were it not for this I'd be a bigger fan of the first track -- the one that sounds like you're in a forest -- but I get distracted (and awakened) by hearing that bird sound that comes closer then fades. ---  --- Even with these things in mind, I have to say I haven't slept this well in YEARS. I love this thing, and I wish I'd found it earlier. In fact, I love it so much I've given it as a gift to two friends who'd tried on my mask while they were visiting and fell in love with it, too
I absolutely love this hairbrush! I have curly hair and like to blow it out often and until now I have not been impressed with any brushes. This brush holds the hair in pace when blowing dry and also lets you move it with your hair and dose not hurt as some can or get stuck. You will not be sorry if you are looking for the perfect brush to go with your perfect dryer (the featherweight)! Oh another thing I like is it extremely easy to keep clean.
I cannot believe this is billed as a baby video.  The images have nothing to do with the music and give absolutely no learning or development value. I personally like the Baby Miracle series of videos that give a great baby sized bible message while being very interactive with my baby.
This cover is the best you can get for your Sansa E series player. It increases the size a little but the durability is worth it. The belt clip is great cause I use mine at the gym too. I purchased an armband but this is much better.  It also comes with a display cover that I have discovered is a necessary item, my display began to show minor scratches after only a couple of weeks use, so if you don't buy this, at least get the little expensive stick on covers. The toughskin also makes the function buttons work a little easier. The small down side to this cover is not being able to get to the micro-sd slot without removing the Sansa, but that is only a small issue. My advice, you have spent big bucks for a great little mp3 player so spend a little more and protect it the best you can
Great idea to hang clothes. The hangers are not long enough to keep the clothes on.  If your child is like mine who loves to dress and re-dress dolls, the armoire is not big enough if you purchase more then 3 outfits. The price is great now. I paid $20.  Great item just wish it was a little bigger maybe even a drawer. 
I brought this because  my kids love spongebob & ice cream..perfect toy, right? WRONG!  The ice cream oozes out of all of spongebob's cracks leaving most of it on your table and very little in the cone.  We have to use half a container of ice cream just to make 2 small cones and then I have a huge mess left in the kitchen. 
I have a 33-34 waste. I bought the medium size because it is  advertised to be fit for 32-34 waste. The thing is too tight! It almost blocks circulation to my legs. Plus, the fabric is not entirely pleasant to the touch. I was mostly disappointed with this product. You can find a much better value at this price
stupid that for bad supply side business i havent gotten the magazine and wont get it for at least another month and yet i am asked to write a review for it. BOO AMAZON WHERES MY MAGAZINE
How can he be such an enormous talent when all he does is copy off of other people? sorry i just cant see it. I dont think he does justice to Nolan Porter's "If I could only be sure" on the first track at all: If you want to hear some great music listen to the original!!!
Just wanted resonably attractive storage. These do the trick. Ordered six and none were defective
I had a hard time finding a play pen for my Grand daughter. There are many Pack N Play items but I wanted a larger square playpen like they made years ago. This one was exactly what I wanted. She has room to roll around and play with toys and it's easy to set up and take down
My 4 year old son received this as a Christmas present.  He has really enjoyed playing it so far.  He can do most of the activities without help.  There is one part where you have to ride a cart down a mountain and click buttons to duck or jump, which I think is pretty hard for little ones (it actually took me a couple of tries to make it down the mountain).  There are many different learning activities:  matching, memory, shapes, size, etc. We did not have any problems loading the game on our computer as another reviewer did.  We have a new Dell computer running on windows XP
I purchased this outdoor atomic clock three months ago and hung it out by our backyard pool.  It is sheltered a bit by the roof overhang, but it still gets some blowing wind and rain.  So far, the clock has kept perfect atomic time.  The temperature indicator is a bit small, so we really can't see that feature from the pool deck, but the hands on the clock are easy to read.  This clock serves our purpose perfectly.  I have read reviews that say outdoor clocks like this aren't really suited for the weather, but I have no complaints, and it's been 90 days of crazy Florida weather.  We got the clock with free shipping, so the price was right, too.  Great clock, great deal
If it is possible to fall madly in love with a box of chocolates, then the assortment is the perfect place to start such an adventure. These chocolate are named after Leonidas Kestekidis, who definitely knew how to create chocolates for the true chocolate connoisseur.  ---  --- When he moved back to Belgium he not only married his true love, he created chocolates the world now adores. When you taste these chocolates, your taste buds will also finally know true chocolate happiness. Whether you try one of these with a cup of coffee or tea or enjoy one as a daily indulgence, these will impress.  ---  --- The "I Love You" chocolate with dreamy lemon filling embodies this sentiment. Each chocolate has a unique design and the I Love You chocolate has two hearts, ribbons and a seal. After you sample the variety of chocolates, specific flavors will stand out as favorites.  ---  --- Here are my favorite creamy fillings (ganache and butter cream) which come in dark, white and milk chocolate depending on the selection:  ---  --- Antoinette - A smooth Brandy flavored ganache  ---  --- Lingoit Lait - Absolutely delicious vanilla flavored fresh butter cream filling. Time definitely stopped while tasting this chocolate.  ---  --- Irrésistible - Dark chocolate and Strawberry sauce.  ---  --- For ever - If you love coffee this may be one of the most delicious milk or dark chocolate chocolates ever made as it is filled with a special coffee cream that has hints of caramel. I ordered an entire box of these and they come in a variety of flavors. The milk chocolate and cherry filling is like Claude Debussy's Rêverie. It is difficult to describe besides saying it is like a delicate cherry icing wrapped in milk chocolate.  ---  --- Merveilleux - Milk or dark chocolate filled with coffee ganache.  ---  --- Europe - Dark or milk chocolate filled with rum filling.  ---  --- Ganache - Milk or dark chocolate with pure ganache.  ---  --- Tosca - Milk chocolate with a special ganache.  ---  --- Poésie - Dark chocolate and a Cointreau filling.  ---  --- Antoinette - Delicate caramel hints in the milk chocolate coating mingle nicely with the vanilla filling.  ---  --- Eve - Milk or dark chocolate with a creamy dreamy banana filling.  ---  --- Alexandre le grand - A milk or dark chocolate with caramel cream.  ---  --- Also Recommended:  ---  --- If you wish to also try the Napolitains, I'd suggest the 1 pound sampler Ballotin with six varieties. You may also want to look for the new Palet d'Or. A deeply delicious and strong bitter chocolate filled with ganache. The center is made with butter, cream and chocolate and the outer coating is a masterpiece with gold decorations.  ---  --- Leonidas now has over 1700 stores and sales locations worldwide and they offer over 80 varieties of fresh chocolates. The chocolates are air freighted weekly from Brussels so you will always find the quality to be superior.  ---  --- My chocolates arrived fast and were as fresh as if I had purchased them in Belgium. They were carefully packaged in the famous gold boxes with signature/seasonal wrapping and a ribbon. The boxes were then placed in protective Styrofoam containers to protect the chocolates during shipping. The expedited shipping is recommended from May to early September.  ---  --- ~TheRebeccaReview.com
If you work in a comic book store, live in your mom's basement, own a lot of black candles, and think that H. P. Lovecraft wrote history books, then you might like this garbage. If you have a life, a clue, or a girlfriend, then you probably will not have any use for this stuff. I still can't figure out how record companies get away with classifying this pseudointellectual fluff as metal. It belongs in a category with Sisters of Mercy or Morrisey. This record is completely lacking any imagination or energy: depressing teenagers is like shooting fish in a barrel. I guess if you want to play dungeons and dragons and fester about feeling like an outcast, this would be the thing to listen to. Personally I think it's a huge ripoff when somebody takes five minutes worth of music and stretches it out into an hour. Don't give these jokers your money.
They spend the first half of this movie saying how great the Ultimate Warrior was.  The journey is awesome!  Then all of the sudden, the paid WWE guys just began to bad-mouth the Warrior. Maybe he did have questionable judgment - but why are they trying to make us feel bad about someone we loved?  They take some very low blows. They say that the Warrior was a bad wrestler. Actually he seemed just fine to me when I was young, and I really can't distinguish one's ability from the other. They just all gang up on him and make outragious allegations. Vince says quickly that the reason why the Ultimate disappeared for 3 years was because he failed a drug test. As soon as he says this, they fade to black then come back with a new issue. What drug use? Which drugs? Presumably they're talking about steroids. But what about that high and mighty Hulk Hogan with his admitted drug use. Let's not talk about that - let's just keep ganging up on the Warrior. They completely ridicule him changing his name to the Warrior. And they also just try to badmouth him so much. Who cares that none of the wrestlers liked him? I don't! He excited the heck out of me way more than any of the dorks who say bad things about him -including Hulk. And oh yeah - they don't even let the Warrior defend himself.  Why did I have to find out from IMDB.com that he was asked to appear but declined? Why don't they address this?  This "docu" is more slanted than "Fahrenheitt 911" Every wrestling and Ultimate Warrior fan will start out loving this docu then hating it. It just leaves you with a bitter taste in your mouth, tired of all of the whining and bitter trash talking.
I think a lot of people miss the power of this movie.  To me this is a scathing view of how simple minded religious people are duped by Ministries in this country.  Even though this was made some years ago before the advent of the infamous TV Ministries today, the message is still clear.  Those who have only a simplistic relgious outlook are prey for the kind of charletans portrayed in this movie.   ---  --- This is certainly one of Burt Lancaster's better roles, and he plays it with much guesto! If we were to look at most of the popular Ministers today we would find that many are from this dark kind of background.  This movie has a strong message.  Don't listen to the word of God from others.  If you must believe in the wild stories of the Bible, do so in your own way.  Do not sanction phoney churches and preachers with your time and money! Even in this modern day and age, the influence of this kind of hokem is still strong.  Mr. Bush and the Republican Party used it as a means to seek re-election!   ---  --- Everyone who is a born again Christian, or a church goer of any kind should see this movie and perhaps get a better understanding of what the religious industry is in this country.  The ending of the film is perhaps a bit contrived, meant to imply the dangers of man assuming the powers of the Almighty (if there is one).  Still, a powerful film for its time and contains a worthwhile message for viewers today. 
This wagon was easy to put together.  We use it frequently when picnicking outdoors and going to the park.  It is big enough for my 2 year old to lie down and take a nap.  It was also large enough to hold our lunch cooler and my daughter.  It is very easy to pull around and is very durable
The graphics are clear, but they are bad! Horses look nothing like that and it is really gross! I would say get it for the younger kids, because they won't care. ---  --- There is nothing to do with the game except earn money, build your hotel, and keep your horse from getting sick. You don't get to ride that often because it said "you have ridden enough for this round" and it is very enoying. you can't pay enough monay to keep more than one horse, but you need to jump them to earn money so you can build your hotel / parking lot / jumping corse / breeding paddock / ect. But you can't do that unless you can jump the horse alot, and you can't. It is easy to go 'bankrupt' so I would say this game is not for little kids because of the money dealing. ---  --- not for older kids because of the dumbness of the horses look, not for younger kids because of the money problems. --- So don't get this game
There were so many continuity errors and spelling problems in this book that I had to stop. Trying to follow two-dimensional characters are difficult enough.  I was just looking for a good fiction book that contained gay themes, characters or both.  I got the gay but not the story
I love this bracelet but the clasp is seriously defective.  I contacted Sabrina, and they were great about sending me a new one ASAP, with a label for returning the other one.  That was impressive, and such responsive customer service is not to be undervalued.  Still, the clasp is a product defect, and I'm sure one of these days I will probably loose the bracelet b/c it comes undone unknowingly
I knew I should have waited!  I got impatient and bought the Masterworks DVD and after watching it once could not bear to see it again, the colors were that awful.  Of course I have to get this, but it's still galling. ---  --- Now if they would only release El Amour Brujo
This toilet seat made it very discouraging for my son to start potty training since the splash gaurd left him with a rash on his inner thighs and lower tummy. The splash guard does not have a smooth finish and when it rubs against his skin, it can be quite painful. I plan on trying the baby bjorn seat, it looks like it would be more comfortabl
I have a 650 with a cell number that has been with me for over 10 years. Perhaps blinded by this incredibly good price, I thought my fulfilled contract (I am on month to month now) meant I could qualify for a "new account" and keep my number. No such luck. After wasting a few hours dealing with Cingular and then someone in India on behalf of Wirefly, I had to return it. It is ironic that someone who has never had a cell phone can get a price 75% lower than a loyal 13 year customer! I will take the next carrier that offers a reasonable price on a 700 even though I would prefer the 750
I got this as a freebie along with W and it lasted only as long as I received it for one year.  The use of fur and skins was nauseating and I couldn't have been more disgusted at the vapid, innocuous, 'insights' it offered.  This magazine has no redeeming social value. 
I have not yet looked at all the documents included in this software. I appreciate the tutorial nature and the pro/con examples given. Since I am not a lawyer, I am a bit nervous about making legal decisions that would need a test in court to be sure I made the correct choices. I did complete the HealthCare Directive and it compares well with others I've seen used in my state. I need to learn more about estate planning and this is going to teach me the jargon and the proper questions to ask. ---  --- My only complaint is that I declined the free delivery option and paid for delivery so I would have enough time to work with it before my parents appointment with their estate attorney.  It did not arrive in a timely manner and I was forced to purchase a download version from another vendor in order to complete forms I wanted the attorney to look at.  It is no surprize that he was more interested in drawing up his own forms for my parents and charging $1000 for a basic package. ---  --- I decided to keep the CD anyway (when it finally arrived) just in case I have a hard drive failure. 
This program is fantastic. It's super easy to use and has a calendar that will notify you of upcoming events/holidays/etc. There are loads of pre-made cards to choose from or you can edit them to your needs. You can also make your own card without any help. The same thing for envelopes!  ---  --- There are also quite a few additional projects included. You can create your own stationary sets (paper and envelopes), awards and certificates, kid's activity pages and more. ---  --- I highly recommend this program if you're a beginner card maker. I mostly bought this (I was a beginner) to save money on cards and in the 2 months I've had this program, it has more than paid for itself. It's much more convenient than going to the store, WAY cheaper and I really like being able to make matching envelopes.
I was very pleased that this seller emailed me right away when I sent him an email about my concerns that the product might not be exactly what I needed and wanted to cancel the order. He very quickly emailed me and assured me he would cancel and refund my credit card and I was impressed with this service. Gayla Tregr
I can only say that this was my favorite record of last year. This record is hard to find in your local record store, so search it out... Incredible - can't wait to hear more!
For the Price, I doubt you could do better.  True, there are higer-end devices out there that will improve your picture to the pinnacle of performance, but if all you're after is a significant improvement in the quality of EVERY channel and DVD you watch, you can't beat the ADS for it's price. The biggest flaw is the device's inability to deal with program material that has excessive light or white backgrounds, where the device either creates artifacts or attempts to correct resolution causing my Philips Plasma set to black-out for moments.  This aside, I'm very happy with the ADS, especially it's under $300 price.  One day maybe I'll upgrade to a unit by DVDO, but not until they come don to the sub-$500 range
I am exceptionally pleased with the product and the company.  I had a minor problem with the merchandise and let them know.  I had an immediate response and the problem was rectified faster than I ever expected
Bought this for my boy who just turned 11. Let's just say that he totally loved it and it was the first present he played with. Two blinking lights on weapon. One light on helmet which makes the eyes glow. A little pricier than other Bionicles but worth it. Not too hard to put together, just make sure you put all of the tiny pieces in a bowl or some such thing so you don't lose them while assembling the guy. The folks at LEGO are geniuses, sure it's a franchise, but they're doing a great job keeping it interesting
I saw the movie in a theater when it first came out. I was a teenager and, although I believed it to be primarily a girl's movie, I did enjoy it. I've seen it several times since then, and it still has not lost its charm. When I finally did read the book, I was disappointed that the movie didn't follow it more closely. To me, these are two different stories. The Holly in the movie is likeable; the novella's Holly is a harpie who cares for no one or nothing else. (When my wife saw the movie, she remarked that Holly was, "an idiot.") However, the book's storyline is more interesting...more haunting, and the book's ending is more intriguing. The movie ends as a love story. The book is much more. And, oh yes, whatever you may think of Capote as an individual, the guy was a damn good writer
Used once. Unit Blew a fuse. No manufacturer supplied info on fuse and none on the fuse body. No contact information was provided by manufacturer or seller. Had to calculate fuse rating. --- Unit is very slow to make coffee. --- Power plug does not fit well in 12V accessory recepticles. Does not go deep enough into recepticle to hold itself in place, has a tendency to pop out of the recepticle. --- No return information provded. --- Considering all the problems, I would not buy another product from this manufacturer, nor would I recommend it to anyone else. Unit is overpriced
This is a good battery and lasts for a long time. Good value
This game is truly worth the wait.  It really makes you feel like you are creating a drug empire and it is incredibly addicting.  The gameplay is awesome the shooting mechanics work great much better than any of the GTA games. This is one of the funnest games to shoot people in and the chainsaw is really awesome.  This probally the funnest open world game i have ever played to drive in.  The cars handle great and are a blast to drive.  The graphics look great and the particle effects are truly awesome.  This is a must get game
I bought this rechargeable shaving system for my husband for Christmas.  It was a replacement of a corded shaver he had been using.  He has been enjoying the features offered by this device.  He especially likes the ability to rinse it out after each use.  It gives a close shave and has a quick charge feature that allows you to charge it for a few minutes and gives at least two shaves.  He has used the razor for about two weeks now with no complaints.  It was a great price for a quality product
Gunpowder tea is green tea, most of which comes from a city named Pingshui in the Eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang, south of the Yangtse River Delta, where it has been cultivated for centuries and is known as the "green pearl" of tea. Pingshui tea market records date as far back as the Tang Dynasty (AD 618 - 907). The area's gunpowder tea was an important tribute traditionally given to the Chinese emperors; and with the growing trade volume between China and the West it also acquired an increasing number of lovers in Europe. Particularly during the second half of the 19th century, when gunpowder tea export reached its peak, its price on the London market was second only to then-popular Wu Yi Oolong (also from China). Even today, Zhejiang Province still proudly calls itself "home of silk and tea" for its two primary natural products.  ---  --- The name "gunpowder" derives from the tea's elaborate method of processing, which traditionally lasts several hours and during which the tea leaves are withered, steamed or stir-fried and individually rolled into small pellets. Early foreign traders mistook these pellets for gunpowder or gunshot.  ---  --- Gunpowder tea has a delicate aroma with a slightly smokey note. It should *always* be enjoyed without milk or cream
I have to say that even though Teti Hatcher's performance was good the movie itself was terrible. The plot was pretty dumb and the situations that take place in the movie are not believable. I can;t believe I wasted my money on this one
ALways loved this group....own several of their CD's and this is by far my favorite.  Darryl Hall's phrasing of his songs are superb.
This shelter met all my expectations.  I would tell anyone to get the optional sand bags if you do not plan to use spikes to secure it.  Being so large, it catches quite a bit of wind and would surely tip over otherwise.  I had mine setup on a raised deck, so the sandbags were a life saver!  Overall this is a high quality item and has already been used a few times and is a much more economical option to renting party tents!  The storage bag is outstanding too... with nice wheels and a handle - it is easy to transport!  The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because it is a little challenging to setup because it is so large
I watched this movie and it sucked,very slow.It might be a renter not a owner
I bought this to fill with sands and candles for an indoor area. It creates a cozy and warm addition when we watch movies and sports. The cover is a nice protective from the kids touching the candles. The sand protectes the fire pit from getting to warm. ---  ---  ---  ---  --- 
Had this game on our gamecube, so addicting then, now we have it on our DS and it is just as much fun. Only downside to it is it can be confusing as to how to unlock all the stuff.  You have to get a certain rating I believe, like A-D, nonetheless it is a great game, worth the money! If you have kids, the kids will thoroughly enjoy
Stiff Upper Lip is a good AC/DC album, it's not a great AC/DC album. ---  --- It kills me when people say that AC/DC have sounded the same since 1973 on every album they have done.  Nothing could be further from the truth. ---  --- I have always thought that each AC/DC album has a sound and a feel and a story in it's own and that a track off each album would be totally out of place on another album.  For instance, can you image Shake a Leg on Stiff Upper Lip?  Or Ballbreaker on Back in Black? ---  --- It doesn't work.  Stiff Upper Lip has its own kind of rough, bluesy feel to it.  Brian's voice sounds different, the tones and the guitars sound different.  It's good but not great.  The standouts... ---  --- 1. Stiff Upper Lip- Pretty rocking song.  Has a good attitude.  It's fun. ---  --- 2. Hold Me Back and Can't Stand Still.  Very odd rolling songs.  They sound a lot alike.  Again, these songs could NEVER have been on Back in Black.  I have heard that Brian sang Can't Stand Still in one take, that's why they all clap at the end.  I don't know if that's true, but it's an interesting song. ---  --- 3. Satellite Blues- This one is an instant classic.  I LOVE this song.  This song could have been done back in the days of Back in Black and if it were on that album I think it would be as popular as You Shook Me All Night Long. ---  --- Everything else is ho hum.  Not good, not bad.  Better than most bands out there.  I am really hoping AC/DC put out a killer album with their new release, whenever that is.  I hope they don't turn into the new G&R and suffer from the Chinese Democracy syndrome
The item was packaged well, but it took over 15 days at normal shipping rate.  The lighter for it stopped working 15 minutes after it was opened. Anyone want the rest of this can? What a waste of time
Like most people who made the effort to see this movie, I read Tim Sandlin's book and thoroughly enjoyed it.  --- Unfortunately for this movie, Sandlin is a far better novelist than screenwriter.  --- The film is disjointed, awkward, and hard to follow. It quickly hops from one important moment of the book to another, allowing almost no time to understand the characters and their motivations or appreciate the bizarre circumstances of the story.  --- The casting isn't bad-- a prepubescent Mischa Barton was a fine choice (a hysterical one for fans of the O.C.), and Jennifer Jason Leigh is also respectable, although she doesn't fit her character's physical description-- but that doesn't nearly make up for the film's jumpy direction and half-baked plot.  --- In sum, this is a dissatisfying and substandard film. Undoubtedly, the subject matter is better suited for a novel, and Sandlin's humor and talents are better utilized there.  --- Read his books. Avoid this movie.
There are lots of little pieces, and the rules are a bit complex. I played it with my nephews ages 7 and 5 and they both had a hard time staying interested for the length of the game. However they have both asked to play it since, so they must like something about it :
I deinstall the product after two weeks of use.  It did not allow me to select Adobe Reader as my default program and was not able to open many PDF documents.  If a document was opened it was often incorrectly formatted for viewing.  Also, the feature to allow editing of the documents in Word or Excel was most often non-functional
Tom Cruise gives an excellent performance as IMF agent Ethan Hunt,who is framed for murder after the death of his IMF team.Together with the help of two other IMF agents,Hunt sets out to find the real murderer.Cornered most of the movie and set to his limits,Hunt and team are hard put to catch the assailants.It all leads to a final showdown on a speeding bullet train with an unlikely foe.Hard core action and awesome intellegence meet in this exhillirating action drama by filmmaker Brian DePalma
Having an M.A. in English literature as well as a B.A. in literature and history, anytime a movie is BOTH historical AND literary . . . well, I get a bit excited to say the least. I don't wish to give the impression that this movie is based on absolute and authentic history because it's not, but the writers/directors/producers set it against a "historical" backdrop nonetheless. On that note, this is yet another stellar title from noneother than Ridley Scott. With that being said, I enjoyed "Tristan and Isolde" almost as much as "Gladiator" and a bit more than "Kingdom of Heaven" (all of these, by the way, are Ridley Scott films). Notice the historical adaptations here?  ---  --- While it may be true that the story of Tristan and Isolde was inspirational to Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet" as well as possibly fueling much of the intrigue of the Arthurian legend, this movie is not exclusively for the high-browed college types. No sir, good ol' red-blooded men and women will certainly be drawn into both the action as well as the romance in this movie. This is by no means a "chick flick" since there is present a large degree of bloodshed and overall suspense. On the other hand, it's not the typical "hack and slash" macho film because at its core is a very dynamic love story. In short, it should please both sexes simultaneously.  ---  --- Aside from James Franco (Tristan), I was rather unfamiliar with most of the cast. Sophia Myles (Isolde) is, for the most part, a newcomer to American audiences despite a rather large resume in mostly British films. I suspect this film will provide her the recognition she certainly deserves on this side of the Atlantic. While many of the other characters were convincing in their roles, no other character was more believable in his villainy than that of the arrogant Irish king (who just so happens to be Isolde's father).  ---  --- In short, this is one of the best movies I've seen in awhile. On some levels it reminds me of "King Arthur." Just as "King Arthur" attempted to provide a plausible history of the legendary Arthur, Guinevere, and Lancelot, so too does Ridley Scott by placing the action a few years after the establishment of the Angle and Saxon kingdoms in England. If you'll recall in "King Arthur," Arthur helps hold back the onslaught of the invading Saxons just as the Roman legions were exiting Britannia. Historians will point out that there is no evidence of Saxons in England until several decades AFTER the Roman withdrawal, but oh well . . . it made for a good story. Here, we witness the Celtic Britons as they are exploited by the Irish across sea. WHAT???? The Irish doing the exploiting and not the other way around? Well, "Tristan and Isolde" holds true to history in this aspect; namely, that the Celtic Britons of England were indeed pushed to the easternmost shores of the island after the coming of the Anglo-Saxons. This would, of course, have placed them in what is now Wales and Cornwall. And this is exactly where the movie is set. Let's not forget the story of Saint Patrick. Remember, he was actually a Romanized Briton who was captured and served as a slave in Ireland before escaping and ultimately returning to Ireland to convert the populace to Christianity. It's interesting to note that in the movie Christianity is a fairly new-fangled religion in Ireland, so no doubt Ridley Scott intended this to remind us of the time period at hand.  ---  --- I particulary liked "King Arthur" and "Kingdom of Heaven" despite the lukewarm reception they received from the critics. Critically speaking, "Tristan and Isolde" has been a bit of a mixed bag as well---but who really bases their decision to watch a movie on the arrogant views of movie critics?  ---  --- Rent it first if you must, but I suspect this one will be a "keeper" in your DVD library! 
I have about an inch and a half of space between my lazy susan and the adjacent bank of drawers.  If I install this lock, the base of it will block one of the drawers from opening.  It also means that I would have to drill into the formica trim on the cabinet.  I'm returning it
I purchased quickbooks 2005; 4th upgrade in 10 years. --- Unlike earlier versions, this one is confusing and painful to use. ---  --- Simple things like making deposits has to do through contraptions. ---   --- One of the reasons I upraded was to use Online banking; it's a complete disaster. It doesn't download the complete trasaction details, reconcilliations are very difficult. --- You will be doing twice the work to use it. ---  --- Once my transfer to the bank was aborted by a message saying you are low on memory and though Quickbooks sent the transaction to the bank, it didn't mark it internally, so on the next login, it sent the payment again!!! It has cost me $1509 of double payment that I am still trying to get back! ---  --- How you pay a bill is totally messed up, There is no way for you to mark that a bill was paid online unless it was done through quickbooks online connection. (Bank's billpay can't be used!!) ---  --- It's very poor in organization, you can't have 2 accounts #'s with  a vendor (still in 2005!!!). --- It has introduced obscure concepts as items and classes, which have no real definition and no "default" use and stop every transaction. ---  --- One of the biggest thing Quickbooks has done to hurt their customers is the payroll. Technically you can do it yourself, but they hide that information and scare you in every step that you should (must) buy the $299/year payroll service (old tax-tables). --- In all the documenation, not once do they mention that you can do the payroll directly and this is how. --- Compared to the earlier products, this is a huge cost. By that reckoning I would have paid ~$2000 for the previous version of quickbooks!! ---  --- It's definitely cheaper to buy a basic version of the software and use an accountant to do the other work and you will be better  --- off. Don't waste money on Quicken services or premium products, they will bleed you to death on your way to a mental asylum
I was tired of the rental skates and wanted to be able to zip around the floor with my kids at the skating rink.  So I bought these skates.  At the time, it felt a little impulsive to spend so much on skates.  Well, now I know I should have spent more and at least be happy with what I purchased. ---  --- I had such a hard time skating with these skates, and when I talked to the guy at the pro shop and 2 people online (there are a lot of resources online-do a search for quad skates) I realized these skates were made for beginning kids, never a 36 year old mom!  They are not made to do the kind of things on the floor you think you might be able to do.  In fact, I couldn't even turn.  I kept having to push off because they would slow down.  I kept adjusting them and had a professional at the rink adjust them for me, and forget it!  I'm selling them at the resale shop and spending more money to at least get something decent
OK, I am not overly modest and 95% of the shorts/pants I buy fit when I purchase and XL size.  These shorts are made for anorexic bean poles.  If you have thighs, legs or even a *tiny* bit of junk in the trunk, forget it.  These are designed for 16 year old girls, not men.  Shipping is also super slow
 --- Turbotax was a great service, but I would like to be able to navigate with menus/tabs to a greater degree of specificity within the input pages itself. Writing the return often requires back-tracking to a page that you alread covered. --- To get to a particular prior page, I would often be forced to go through up to 5 or 6 prior pages, reading the question each time because turbotax highlighted the default which was not my previous choice. This was a colossal waste of time in an otherwise excellent product. It could easily be fixed in the 2006 software if turbotax 1) switched the defaults to the users' previously-inputted values (CompleteTax does this and it seems like an obvious thing to do) and/or made it easy to navigate to a prior page by giving a link to every input page when a user clicks a superior tab or link. This is what a good web-page does, and it would be very helpful if turbotax did the same.  
Here's the deal, I was looking for a good way to move the oil filter to a different place under the hood and this kit did the job perfectly.  The filter on my son's car is on the side of the engine block (Nissan 240SX) and located right above a section of the frame that has holes in the top.  Every time I remove the filter, the oil drains out of the filter and enevitably into the frame (a big wad of shop rags or towels under the filter helps, but not always), then I've got oil draining from the frame for the next week, making a mess all over the driveway.  Anyway, the pump thing with the drain tube running from the pan is unique, but not what I bought the kit for (I only used the filter relocator).  Was impressed with the quality of the fittings and the hoses and everything hooked up like they said it would.  The big plus though.....  it's about one third the cost of any other kit out there (including those listed on Amazon.com)and it comes with adapters to fit just about any car.  Been on the car now for about 8 months with no problems and has made changing the filter sooooo much easier and cleaner....... in fact decided to buy another kit from Amazon for my own car
When merging female vocal yodels and copying elements from Switchblade Syphony, one can only be disappointed in Diva Destruction's music.  The positive aspect is the better production on this CD compared to their debut
Bought an assortment of the Drake's snacks because of them being often mentioned on "King of Queens" and was surprised at how tasty these apple pies were. Just the right balance of fruit and cinnamon. Great late night snack. Buy em
This watch is exactly what I was looking for. It is a small, pretty, functional watch that is quite durable.  It has plenty of features, but is not extremely complicated. The color is slightly lighter and more purpley then it is in the pictures
I purchased the Casio keyboard for my Grand-daughter's 4th birthday.  She really enjoyed playing it.  As a matter of fact she was still interested in it the next day.  It is the perfect size for a small child.  She sits in her recliner and has the keyboard across the arms.  The only thing that wasn't perfect is that you can mute what the child is playing, but not the 10 songs that are prerecorded in it
It is a good watch under $200 price range. If you buy it, you will love it forever. One thing I hate is little bit heavy, but not a big deal. :) 
speakers give good sound quality and are small and unnoticeable at a good price all the things I was looking for in speake
This holster provides good protection for the device and has the sturdy swivel clip for your belt.  The flap is secured by a magnet making it easy to remove the device.  It does just what you want it to do
Phillip Hoffman is searching for purity.  Unfortunately his play has been purchased by a wild Hollywood movie crew, and they are off and shooting in Waterford, Vermont because Main Street is already there.  It is cheaper than building a set.  Then the town folks, New Englanders, dry and pragmatic, mingle with Hollywood slime balls, daft, smooth-talking director, William H. Macy and screen idol, young girl chasing, Alex Baldwin. Sarah J. Parker of Sex in the City fame plays the nymphomaniac actress bedding everyone in sight.  Small town smart girl Rebecca Pigeon and writer Hoffman make the necessary changes in the script and then they fall in love. A scandal threatens the shoot and somebody forgets the mayor's dinner party.  There is plenty of manic fun here.  I recommend for a good laugh. Also, is it just me or is William H. Macy the best actor in the world
I'm on a low carb diet and didn't like just eating a bowl of plain tuna with mayo... yuck!  I add a cup of Dreamfield's elbows to give me a better lunch for only 5 net carbs and now I actually look forward to having tuna.  Also, for 7 carbs you can add shredded cheese, a drop of milk, a pat of butter and pinch of salt to indulge yourself in a creamy macaroni with cheese dish!  Yummy :o
Outstanding service - product was as described and the price was fair - mailing in a timely manner was acceptable.  Will continue to shop for similar items via Amazon
I own the first two volumes of the Lost Treasures series and am waiting for the third to arrive on my doormat. They are brilliant and I hope more volumes appear on a regular basis. --- Why though, must I suffer for purchasing these titles when they are released by not being able to get The Plays volume without buying them all over again? --- I suspect (and hope) that it will eventually be released seperately but in the meantime I can only say that if you don't already own any of these and are a fan of Broadway, theatre or the performing arts in general, buy this today! A fantastic showcase of theatrical talent
These bibs are the best. My son is a messy eater and loves to drink water and spit it out. When meal time is over his shirt is dry and all the water is in the handy pouch. Must have for any new parent
This is my first purchase that I have been unhappy with.  The tingler arrived with two of the tingles off.  Attempts to put them back on were unsuccessful.  I had attempted to email customer service three separate times and have received no response.  I would appreciate either a refund or a new one sent to my address. ---  --- Jon Fresh --- 2716 NE Lorie Dr. --- Hillsboro, Or 97124. ---  --- The tingler was to be part of a massage Christmas gift for my wife.  I would appreciate your time in this matter. ---  --- Thanks, ---  --- Jon Fres
My house was built in 1862 and I have struggled with several different gates trying to get one to fit my odd sized, crooked doorways. This gate (when hardware mounted) adjusts to fit my doorways where no other gate could. I agree that it's not easy to use, you have to readjust the size each time it's opened or closed, but for me it's worth it to have a gate that fits my crooked doorways. Also, the hardware mounted installation template that was included made it SUPER easy to install. I'm very happy with this gate
This book written by Don Brown is a wonderful children's book.  In this story, set in 1870, Mary Kingsley uses her childhood to motivate her travels to Africa. Mary begins the story as a child, who is taking care of her ill mother. Her father travels a lot, and is rarely home. Although Mary never attended school she loves to read and uses this to escape. Mary, now an adult travels to Africa which was a big accomplishment for a woman at that time. The book tells some of her experiences in Africa. Without revealing what happens at the end, I will tell you that Mary has many experiences in this children's book. She takes the reader through her life. The illustrations in the book help the reader visualize Mary's life. This is not my favorite children's book, but I would highly recommend this book to any parent or child. It kept my interest and it is sure to keep yours
I've been doing game dev for a number of years now, and it's like a breath of fresh air to come upon a book like this. Clearly written, well organized, and a breeze to read through! My thanks goes out to each and every one of the authors who contributed to this invaluable tome.  I'd give this thing six stars if I could. You will not regret buying this book!!
It worked quite nicely until after about 9 months the display just stopped working.  Changed the batteries to no avail.  It's very pretty, but I have a less attractive old Tanita that does body fat measurements which has been working for 5 years
Unless you are interested in reading one chapter after another plugging Bear Spray, don't waste your time.  The stories are all re-hashed versions of nearly identical situations; Man goes into the wilderness-Man sees bear-Man uses UDAP Bear Spray on bear-bear retreats.  This book is one long advertisement for UDAP!!  My book was actually misprinted, missing 50 pages right in the middle.  Initially I wanted to return my book for a complete one but, after reading the rest of 223 pages, I didn't want to waste any more of my time with this ONE story
The thing that seperates this DVD Case from the rest is it's center lock design. It's secures the disc nicely without damaging it... like I have had others do. Worth the extra dough to have a quality product. (Now if only their memorex's software was as good!
I was a little hesitent to make a big order for so much tea, not knowing if I would like it.  So I went to a local supermarket and bought a tin there so I might give it a taste test.  This is quite a good green tea.  Other than buying generic green teabags, I usually buy a Bancha tea. This tea is not as grassy, more bold with a slight smokey taste and more of a kickiness to it. --- The cannisters are nice and their is an inside foil liner to keep the tea fresh.  The only thing to be aware is that this is a lot of tea, altogether 21 ounces divided into six separate cannisters. Unless you really love this tea, plan on making some gifts
Okay, I may be picky, but these earrings are just too thin!  I get the idea of delicate, sparkly things, but these don't look so much delicate as they do insubstantial.  They are pretty and sparkly, but the crystal looks like all I could afford was a thin slice.  The picture also makes the crystals appear blue-ish, but mine are more of a yellow-ish tint.  Not what I expected
I finally subscribed to Glamour after buying it every month at the grocery store, each time saying it would be the last time I bought this "vapid silly thing." What can I say? It's addictive. We can't read the Economist all the time now, can we
Makes plane flights so much more enjoyable and costs hundreds less than other brands.  Only  thing that could make it better is passive noise reduction but then it would be bulkier
Unfortunately, I have not received the item.  It's been 4.5 weeks since I placed the order.  I am reviewing this a low star, it should not take this long to receive a magazine subscription
The title of this movie holds no secrets. The Virgin suicides may have its up and downs throughout the movie but the whole time the viewer is left with an impending sense of doom. Almost every aspect of this movie is fantastic, between the acting and a great story line, but this movie is truly dramatic in that it will no doubt influence your emotions
I shopped online for probably two months before finally settling on these headphones.  I wanted nice headphones to compliment my iPod, yet at an affordable price.  The AKG K 27i is the perfect solution.  After looking at other models by AKG, and other brands like Sennheiser and Bose, I thought I would have to spend at least $100 in order to get quality, but then I found these and I snatched them up. ---  --- The sound is excellent.  When I first plugged them in, I thought they were a little quiet.  But, then I discovered that there is a lanyard-style volume switch on the headphones themselves, which is fantastic.  I don't have to reach into my pocket to turn the volume up or down on my iPod.  The sound is very crisp and articulate, with deep, accentuating bass.  And because these headphones are designed for portable mp3 players, my iPod is powerful enough to really push the drivers of the headphones. ---  --- The soft ear pads offer great comfort for long listening (and sound dampening! They block out a lot of ambient noise!), but the headband takes some getting used to, as it is a little bit tight.  Once you adjust to it though, you can wear them for hours. ---  --- The last thing I will mention is the style.  These headphones look great and the colors compliment the white iPod really well.  They also fold up to an incredibly compact size, and they even come with a travel pouch.  Now that is convenient. ---  --- If you are looking for great headphones for your portable mp3 player, I truly say look no further.  I did so much research before settling on these, that I feel like I became an expert in the audio field.  The AKG K 27i offers amazing sound, great comfort, compact size, and best of all, affordability
I started with Norton Ghost 2003 many years ago and had problems backing up clone images.  Acronis True Image Backup 9.0 has a simple user interface that works well.  I used it to re-image my son's computer without any problems.  It is a good product for the price.  I highly recommend making a backup image of your hard drive on a weekly basis
Take care because if not you can lose much air triying to know the preassure of the tire
A delicious, nutritious cereal that rebounds energy at breakfast or for a quick snack.  Very vegan and very good
This combo cable gateway and wireless router seems like a dream come true.  Instead, should you fail to heed my warning and purchase this item, you'll be subjected to a nightmare that will only end when you seek another wireless solution. ---  --- As a cable gateway the WCG200 performs as expected.  Setup with my ISP (Cox in southern California) was a breeze.  I was up and running in no time. ---  --- Wireless connectivity, however, has been an absolute nightmare.  None of my devices (laptops, bridge, print server) will stay connected for any length of time.  When the router is performing well, I'm lucky to stay connected for an hour.  When the router is performing poorly I can barely stay connected for 15 seconds. ---  --- The Linksys forums are crowded with other users reporting the same problem.  I've been unable to find any official acknowledgement or response from Linksys. ---  --- Do yourself a favor and avoid the WCG200.  You will regret purchasing it
Hot Hot Heat is one of the few new bands to pique my interest. Their first release was decent, but "Elevator" is even better. Great tunes, drums and guitars - and, of course, Steve Bays' yelping vocals. There's only three songs I really don't care for - "Pickin' It Up", "Soldier In A Box" and "Shame On You". Looking forward to the next CD
Almost immediately after I received this never-used pen, I noticed that the ink does not dispense evenly.  Often, it does not write on any surface.  After I scratch the pen tip wildly for ~5 seconds, it starts to write again.  I've thrown it away because it is too inconvenient for use.  However, it is very cheap, so maybe it's okay for someone who doesn't need to use a tiny pen too often
I TRASHED THE ISSUE WHEN I SAW THE SHOT OF TRASHY PARIS HILTON.  THERE IS ENOUGH NUDITY ALREADY IN YOUR PUBLICATION AND SEEING THAT SAD PIECE OF WORK (HER) ON THE COVER JUST TURNED ME OFF COMPLETELY.  SORRY YOU THOUGHT HER 'COVER WORTHY'.  PROBABLY MISSED SOME FINE ARTICLES.  SINCERELY: DEANE EVERETT 
This book gives a thorough analysis on how public policies were the catalysts for the socioeconomic destruction of low-income communities of color in New York City. Necessary reading for those who still do not  realize that activism and organizing are important vehicles through which  marginalized communities keep in check the forces that seek to further  fragment and disenfranchise them
This is my third Skagen watch.  The design is ultra thin and the titanium consturction makes it ultra light. The design is sophisticated enough for dress and sleek enough for sports wear. They have proven to be reliable timekeepers and I liked this one so much I bought two more for my sons. At less than $80.00 each they are a real bargin
I love this pasta so much that I'm constantly paranoid that it's not really low carb.  There is absolutely no taste difference, and it preps exactly the same as regular pasta
Good product Amazon had a great price.  Even though people say it is high priced I paid $44 after discounts.  I tried the Beta version and I liked it.  Beta version does not give you all of the features but enough to get the idea.  Easy to install worked at the get go.  Intuitive enough to figure it out.  You may have to go through things a few times to understand what it means.   Didn't have a manual with the Beta version and still figured it out. Manual does provide information, works great.  Didn't need any help. Had Mcafee before didn't find any new virus. It works as good as Mcafee but it is a lot faster when you start up.  Both Kaspersky and Mcafee have features I like. 
I was shocked by the level of neediness and desire to blame others expressed by Christiane Northrup in this jumble of a book. At a time when I needed medical advice to decipher the overwhelming physical changes happening to my body; I turned to Christian Northrup as a wise healer who has had the privilege of medical training and a mature woman with the actual experience of menopause. A wonderful combination if Northrup had chosen to focus on menopause. Instead she is all over the map, taking swipes at everyone who has disappointed her in her life. If I wanted to hear my gal pals whine about the mothers, husbands, and daughters I could have shared a meal with any group of women struggling through the ups and downs of life. Instead, I sought the help of a respected physician and got quite a shock, as she rehashes all the real and imagined slights of her life. If you are a middle aged woman who has "stuffed your feelings" all your life, and need help speaking up for your youself; this book may be a big help to you in finding your voice. But if you are a woman who has stood up for herself while you matured, this book will shock you with its pettiness. I am quite New Age and believe in all the woo-woo stuff mentioned in this book; but when I turn to a physician for medical advice on a medical issue; that's what I expect. I can only hope that Northrup will re-read this book as some point in her life and decide to take it out of publication. I was embarrassed for her and returned it. I just don't buy it in more ways then one.
We had to buy a new pack n play because our other one was coming apart. I chose this one because of its features and colors. My daughter hated this and screamed every time we put her in it. We tried for days to get her to use this, but she never would. So, we returned this and got a different that she absolutely loves.
I just began baking with Splenda when we found out my dad has pre-diabetes. For Easter I prepared a sugarless ricotta tart with Splenda and it worked beautifully. Everyone agreed that it didn't taste sugar-free and my dad really enjoyed it.
It took forever for this magazine to get to the address and it also is shipped a week to 2 weeks after the magazine is already on the stands.  What's the point of having a subscription if you get the magazine later than everyone else? I will never order a magazine from Amazon again, I'll go through the actual magazine company instead
These cookies do not taste like they ever saw the inside of a box. They taste like real butter and fresh ingredients - And they just about melt in your mouth. I'll be buying these again
I got this bra at a deeply discounted price when it was on clearance at a nearby store, and I didn't realize how much I liked it until I decided to buy another one some time later, and panicked when I couldn't make out the writing on the tag.  I have been trying to find this dang bra for AGES! Finally! I found it again! I am so stoked!  The one I bought so long ago is my favorite bra, and it looks pretty sad by now.  Like other reviewers' bras, mine developed a split in the fabric, but it was only after many, many washes in the machine, rides on the bike, exercise DVDs, naps, etc.   ---  --- I like this bra because it fits me so well, but also because the fabric is so breathable--no cotton, so it dries fast!  It is really stable so I actually use mine instead of a sports bra, because sports bras suck.  If I could, I would people the lingerie world with these bras. The only problem a lady might have with this bra is sheerness-related:  Don't wear it with a sheer shirt!  I wish there were another version, "Opaque Tapestry," maybe.  Then I'd never buy any other bra
So, if it's such an excellent game, why 4 stars on "fun" rating? ---  --- Well, it's a very very fun game, but some parts can get annoying and aggravating. And it seems as if the different levels of difficulty are achieved by handing you less and less health upgrades, which is kinda cheap, if you ask me. They physically limit you, instead of strategicly doing so. ---  --- But everything else is great about it. Graphics are great, not excellent, but great. Sound is great too. Gameplay is excellent and the story is very well developed. Kinda on the easy side in normal level, though. But, I guess nothing is perfect. ---  --- Go ahead and get this one. It's worth what it costs
...not much more...for us, at least.  we were so excited by the idea of this product and the orange/burgandy colors!  but when it come down to it, we just couldn't ever adjust it comfortably enough for ourselves or the baby.  we used and liked a hand-me-down baby bjorn and "breast friend" sling much better.  sigh, such a waste of a pretty sling.  ;-
Feeling more than a bit fleeced by McAfee's overpriced "subscription" renewal every year, I decided to give Kaspersky a try.  Installation went smoothly and everything seemed fine for 2 or 3 weeks.  Then one day my computer would not boot---just stalled on a blank screen right after the Windows XP splash screen.  When trying to boot up in safe mode, a list of the drivers currently loading scrolled down the screen.  It stopped at a file called kl1.sys and hung there forever.  A little research at work showed that this was a Kaspersky file.   ---  --- It may be just a coincidence that my system suddenly went kaput shortly after installing the new antivirus program, but I doubt it.  Attempts to use a recovery disk failed.  A trip to the local computer shop revealed that the data on my hard drives (which were in the inscrutable RAID 0 format) could not be recovered (unless I wanted to ship them to a recovery shop, and nothing on them was worth that much).  So they're going to reinstall windows, I'll have to do reinstall a shipload of software when I finally get my computer back, and, yes, I'll lose all the data that was on there.  (Gee, good thing I backed up all the kids' photos---well, most of them.  Thanks, Kaspersky!) ---  --- Anyway, perhaps my attempts at recovering the OS caused the worst of this.   Whatever the case, I believe the boot failure was caused by either the Kaspersky file being corrupted or a virus.  Who knows.  Kaspersky is to blame in both scenarios.  I do know one thing: I am not going to tempt fate by loading this program on my computer again. ---  --- And Kaspersky has yet to respond to my e-mail.  I got an automated "we received your e-mail" response, but nothing more, even though they state that they usually respond within a day or two.  That was over a week ago.  If in fact their software is in no way responsible for my computer flaking out on me, then I still do not apologize for the one-star rating, given their horrible customer service. ---  --- If you decide I'm insane or that this was just a fluke, at least do yourself a favor and make a decent boot disk for yourself before installing this product.  That might mean the difference between losing data/spending $$$ and just being inconvenienced.  And don't expect much assistance from Kaspersky should things go wrong.
I bought these for my husband, and he loves them.  The material is soft and comfortable, and they keep his feet warm.  They are also easier to slip on and off than his previous pair of slippers.  He wears 11 1/2 wide, so I got him the XL pair, and they fit him well
I like this because it is a nice construction.  I bought the white and it blends in nicely.  I just wish it was a little higher.  We have a newer construction home and the bathroom counters are high so it is still too low for her to wash hands by herself for now. 
I received these seat covers as a birthday gift and one of them did rip at the seam (also shortly after they were installed). I came on here to order another and after reading that someone else had the same problem I know not to waste my money. They are very unique and I do like the looks of them but only wish they were better quality
I have one and Panasonic doesn't have driver or processing downloads for it or even respond to requests. The proprietary video format requires special handling in your PC and can leave you with a camera full of useless clips.  Are they abandoning this product? Look on the Panasonic website and see for yourself
We subscribed to this for a school fundraiser. The first issue came November 13 with many useful  coupons, ONLY they expired in October 2006! I wish I could get my money back on a useless magazine filled with alot of advertising. If you want a decent health magazine, try PREVENTION. They have alot more to offer than this rag. Save your money, I wish I had!Take the time to search around. I hope this saves someone from making the mistake I had
I've a Norton user for many years.  I 'upgraded?' from NAV 2005.  This product was a pain to install.  I had to uninstall Zone Alarm, which isn't noted anywhere.  I've never had to do that before.  The installation process required rebooting multiple times.  In the past it had been an easy process.  Not anymore!  I will not buy Norton in the future
An excellent project for your child's school report.  We purchased the Velociraptor kit for our 8 year old daughter not knowing what to expect. After opening the package my wife came up with the clever idea of pouring melted chocolate chips into the dinosaur molds, instead of using the plaster mix that comes with the kit. We experimented with white chocolate chips and created realistic looking dinosaur bones! We buried these edible bones in ground up Oreo Cookies.  What a thrill to see our daughter's 2nd grade class excavate these delectible prehistoric fossils!  We can't wait to purchase other kits in the Eyewitness series
Yes, the magazine is great...  but up to 1/3 of the pages are ads.  They will shamelessly load you up with renewal letters.  And occasionally, you get a big stinky AOL disk in with your issue.  Kinda like someone dooking in your cheerios.  Welcome to the mainstream media
My last Braun Razor was model 6550, which I purchased 7 years ago. The Braun 8975 is a pleasure using, quick and close shave. The technology has come a long way. I have always used Braun and this is by far the best yet.
Good baby monitor overall.  Sound quality is good except we are getting an occasional clicking sound and I can't find where the interference is coming from
This is only the second pair of binoculars I've owned but I've used many pairs before from low end to relatively high end ones like Nikons and Leicas.  I can say without hesitation that the Canon 18X50s have met all my expectations for clarity, build quality, and ease of use. They are still quite heavy so, you won't be holding them too long in one position but, the stabilization feature provides a stable, gitter free image. In my opinion, this feature makes up for optics that may not be in the same league with the high end stuff: the Canon 18X50s have more usable magnification for the money for non-tripod, hand held applications.  ---  --- While this is not a scientific comparison, this is an example of the useability and magnification: I was at the beach looking at a parasailer in the distance - with the naked eye (20/20 for the record), I could see the chute pattern and a black speck below it; with my old Minolta 10X50s (jittering in my hands)I could make out shapes of heads and legs; with the Canon 18X50s, I could clearly see two people, a man and a child as well as the chute's cords - pretty impressive.   ---  --- My only two gripes that have also been mentioned before are: no lense caps and the eye cups are stiff, fit poorly (to my face any way) and are uncomfortable. I find it better to fold the cups back for "eye glass" use even though I don't wear glasses.  Other than that, I am very pleased with this purchase and would also highly recommend purchasing from Adorama Camera - they are quick, accommodating and responsive.
I'm surprised by all the praise this movie gets here at Amazon and beyond. There really wasn't much here I liked. The soundtrack was the usual "pap" you'd expect from a family friendly movie, though the sets were nice. It seems this movie was just miscast. Mel just doesn't do comedy all that well, at least for a lead role. Jame Garner, the reason I bought this seems more like a bystander. And Jodie is Jodie and I never bought for a moment she was her character.  ---  --- Although the cast is a powerhouse (on paper), sadly the chemistry never really works and the jokes are just cornball. An example: There was a sequence when Bret asks his friends (who are standing behind him) to whistle to reveal themselves to some bandits he was confronting; which as it turns out they are unable to do. Instead Jodie and James, blow madly, just like the movie. ---  --- This movie reminds me a HELL of a lot like ''The Three Amigo's''; on paper you would think it couldn't miss, but on film it's painful to watch
This italian gift basket,captures the feeling of italy,at it best...When you send this to family or friends,they will definitly,feel the love and warmth,of italy,and is sure to please...5 star recommended..
These lovely little gems are perfect for those women who, like me, have a second or third ear piercing. Small enough to be dainty but large enough to be seen without being unnecessarily ostentatious.  --- These would make a great gift for a little girl as well.I particularly liked the price point where they were being offered as I suffer from a nickel allergy and always wear gold posts in my ear. Having recently transitioned from yellow to white gold these were lovely additions to my collection. At the price of under 10 dollars I was able to give them to a few others as a little hi there, how are you.
Corny science fiction less favorite of mine not even in the top 10 !  --- Afi took the idea on a better approache of this movie about a boy robot !
Of all the many Swiss Army Knives I own, this is the most used.  Not only is the Pocket Pal small enough to easily carry in a front jean's pocket, its simplicity makes it perfect for quick use for fruit peeling, paper cutting, and a whole host of tasks
 --- It is a shame that such a good magazine lacks so much in customer service.  I subscribed  in 2005 and only received one (1) issue which was informative, well structured  and beautifully illustrated.  When i e-mailed the company to find out what had happened with the rest of my subscription, --- Roseanne Tully's (CEO & Publisher to Intermezzo Magazine) response to my inquiry was that the next publication would be sent immediately and that "the rest of the 6 issues would be delivered even if it takes more than a year".  To date, i have not received a single issue since i made my complaint in March nor have i received a refund.   --- If you're a foodie as myself, and like to keep up with the trends in the culinary industry;  what good is it to subscribe to a publication that takes your money and does not deliver or delivers outdated magazines
My child LOVES Geotrax and plays with them everyday.  However, Big City Lights makes your track look good but doesn't have much for a child to interact; the crane has a crank to turn but the bricks are hard to get to stick in the clamp and besides a button for sounds that is about all this has to offer.  Unlike other pieces with Geomotion this one is a bore.  My child rarely plays with this piece except to watch the RC trains go under it.
This is like hot sauce concentrate.  You MUST dilute it to use it.  Do not try to eat this stuff straight or you will be miserable for hours, and then some.  Lets just say it burns both ways.  A teaspoon in an entire crock of chili will make the chili hot enough to be near inedible, and I like very hot and spicy foods.  Five or six drops is probably more than enough for an entire dish.  Tabasco isn't even comparable to this, because no amount of tabasco would make a dish that hot.  This is truly the hotest sauce I have ever had, I think it killed my tastebuds (slight sarcasm). ---  --- Wash your hands thoroughly after use as there will often be residue on the lid.  If you rub your eyes they will burn for a long time, and I would suggest flushing them with water for about 10 minutes if you have the unfortunate experience. ---  --- The first listed ingredient is habaneros
Opened the enclosure, plugged in my hard drive, connected it to my PC, and it worked. Simple as that. ---  --- I spent a whole 10 seconds realizing that the instructions provided showed that I had to remove a single screw from the back panel when I really had to remove two screws, but that was the only (very minor) problem. ---  --- There is no fan in the case, which means the only noise is from the hard drive itself. I am assuming the case itself acts as a large heatsink, but I havent yet monitered temperatures on the hard drive itself. ---  --- I am pleased with the enclosure, and would happily recomend it to anyone
There is nothing wrong with the knife itself but there is a major design flaw. The ring to attach the knife to say a set of keys is on the wrong side; so the open knife is not away from the set of keys. This is the first swiss army knife I have ever come across with this flaw. So alway make sure the ring is opposite the swiss army logo!!
After reading a review here mentioning subscription issues I went directly to American Artists web site and ordered a subscription. That was November 23, 2005 and now Feb. 10, 2006 still no magazine. When I finally complained I got a request to send my credit info again to vnu@espcomp.com. Can't say from looking at that address that I have confidence I was communicating with American Artist or a magazine publisher. Would you send your credit info...I think not. I'd say don't blame Amazon as a previous reviewer did.  Hey, the magazine is good if you can get a subscription
I cannot say how well this product really compares to other sunscreens in terms of sun protection. But it does have the right ingredients that most top-rated sunscreens/sunblocks use, so it should be at least on par with them. ---  --- Where this product really shines (or DOESN'T shine) is for people with combination/oily skin. I have tried MANY sunscreens, and it's so hard to find a sunscreen WITHOUT moisturizers (if you have oily skin, that's already your natural moisturizers). ---  --- I have even tried other NEUTROGENA sunscreens that are supposed to be OIL FREE and all that. The result on my face? After applying it, I always SHINE (which is NOT what I want). ---  --- This magnificent product, however, actually gives my face a nice MATTE finish... and matte FEEL, too! It's a pretty thick cream when you first apply it (as opposed to other suncreens or other products that feel more like LOTION), but is almost immediately absorbed by the skin. In 30 seconds, there is no more greasy/creamy feeling, and in one minute, if you feel your skin, there's a nice matte feel. ---  --- HOWEVER, and this is not the fault of the product, after about 3 hours (at least for me), then I feel like the matte effect has worn off, and my oily skin is again showing its oily nature. ---  --- Still, as far as suncreens go, this is the best I have tried for my skin, and I highly recommend it for people with combination/oily skin. ---  --- BTW, this review is for the actual product I got, which is SPF 30. As of the time I am writing this review, here in amazon they also offer an SPF 45 version, and cheaper, too! I don't know the difference, but I always go for the LOWER one (in this case, SPF 30), because I theorize -- rightly or wrongly, I don't know -- that the lesser the SPF, the lesser the strength of the ingredients, so maybe it's better for sensitive skin (?)
Always lively and perspicacious, this clever book seeks to solve a seemingly trivial puzzle: while historians have mustered a host of plausible explanations (weapons, diseases, horses, etc.) for why Europeans spread so thickly into North America, Australia, New Zealand and Argentina (the lands Crosby labels "Neo-Europes"), what could possibly explain why the dandelion did so as well? The question doesn't appear so innocuous when it is pointed out that not just the dandelion, but the European housefly, and feral pigs, and a horde of other weeds, pests, crops, diseases and livestock from Europe followed suit. Quite often these organisms, even the domesticated ones, raced ahead of European explorers themselves, rapidly proliferating into vast herds and stands that the settlers themselves could not fathom. Why was this so? Why didn't, say, Australian weeds, their seeds inadvertently shipped back to England, eventually carpet the meadows and fields of Europe? To answer this odd question, Professor Crosby begins his story with Pangaea--the great supercontinent that began to split apart about 200 million years ago into the continents we now have scattered about the globe. These "seams of Pangaea" then forced a radical divergence in the terrestrial flora and fauna of the planet, and set the stage for the equally radical convergence initiated when European mariners crossed these now mid-oceanic seams. Crosby details case after case in each category: weeds, pests, livestock, diseases and crops. He forcefully illustrates how sudden and overwhelming the ecosystem takeover was until the suspense is too much to bear. What is the answer? He drops clues every now and then, and the most explicit one is in the form of a quote that begins one of the final chapters: if weeds are to be defined as those organisms that thrive on the disturbances caused by humans, then humans themselves must be considered the primary weed of all. Here, then is the answer: all the opportunistic fellow-travelers of the European diaspora are exquisitely coadapted to the scale and pace of the continuous ecological disequilibrium characteristic of the Old World civilizations--and they, in turn, furthered and helped generate that very disequilibrium. Together--humans, horses, cattle, pigs, rats, clover, peaches, measles and, yes,  dandelions--comprised a potent self-replicating system, dimly discerned by its contemporaries, that could not be stopped once it spilled across the seams of Pangaea
Our book club read this book for our February 2006 selection.  It was a really good book, we were all excited about discussing it.  Mr. Johnson sent us discussion questions that really made us think. ---  --- A few members felt that Denmark never loved Sierra but saw her more as property.  The book definitely has some suprises that you don't see coming.  We really enjoyed the book. ---  --- Sistahs of Ebony Pages
This has got to be one of the worst films I've ever seen. The characters are pointless and one-dimensional. The guy is a jerk and inspires no sympathy. They have sudden fights over apparently nothing. In fact, there is no cause-and-effect in this movie at all! Things just happen randomly for no apparent reason. There's no real story. The takes are boring; most scenes hum along endlessly making for quite boring viewing. The violent ending wasn't even believable! Instead of inspiring any kind of shock or sympathy, I was left just thinking "what the...???" Really, really pointless all around
I've been using SweetLeaf SteviaPlus for about 3 weeks now, and I'm so glad I decided to try it. I was worried about the research coming out about aspartame; and Splenda... well, it just does terrible things to my stomach. I simply can't use it. So I started doing some web-searching and learned about stevia. I liked the fact that it was natural and used extensively in other countries, such as Japan. But I still kept my expectations low... it sounded too good to be true and I figured it would taste awful. I ordered SweetLeaf SteviaPlus and to my surprise and delight, I love the taste. It's sweet, and no bitterness. Now I'm a person who is used to using artificial sweeteners, so someone who uses only sugar might have a different opinion, but I did share it with a coworker to use in his tea, and he really liked it as well. So, don't be afraid to try it if you haven't already. I notice that I'm feeling a lot better lately. Maybe it's the switch from artificial sweeteners to stevia. At any rate, I'm happy with it, and I recently placed another order for both packets and tablets
My mother lives in a rural part of the country in Ohio (she is a native of Thailand) anyway being in a small town, it is not easy to find Thai anything, this makes it so easy to send a little taste of home to her, at her front door.  Prompt shipping and packing
I tried putting this on a shopping cart from Target.  This does not cover area at all!!  I caught my baby biting on the cart handle and almost flipped! ---  --- Not good... Plus its annoying to put on
If you are trying to learn relaxation through biofeedback, this is the product to buy. Packaging, support, presentation, and hardware/software quality are the best that I have seen.  No down side. It's not a game in the usual sense. More of a way to learn techniques in a quiet and amusing way.  ---  --- There is room for a little mischief. Instead of allowing the balloons to flow smoothly, I tried busting a few. Type A personality shows through occasionally. I will be purchasing the next item in the series. I am learning to relax, at will, which will be helpful in my high-stress occupation. Good luck
Cannes Man was funny.  I don't know why this movie was in the drama section of Blockbuster, but it made me laugh out loud. Just goes to show that nobody knows anything in lalaland, and movies are made by a bunch of nincompoops who don't know their **s from a hole in the ground
It is probably too late to save anyone from this software but I had to say something about it to someone. There is apparently no way to tell taxcut about it.  --- I have been using taxcut for several years now after switching from turbotax because of the issue of them installing spyware. I was happy with taxcut until this year. It is defective. I can't even believe it isn't in the news. My taxcut program is missing the "wages" entry on the Schedule C form. It would have been a terrible loss if I had not caught it. I went to their website to get some help or a phone number and neither was available. I can't believe that I have the only taxcut software that is defective but I couldn't find any reference to this problem anywhere. Now I have to go through the whole tax form to make sure it didn't make any other mistakes! I might as well have done my taxes the old fashioned way by hand.
Seriously....I was waiting quite awhile for this game to come out because its predecessor is freakin sweet.  It was all I use to play online.  After purchasing this game and playing it for all of 10 minutes I quietly put it back in the box and have not taken it out since.  Online play was non existent.  Everytime i clicked on a game it said it didnt exist.  It was ridiculus.  Letting someone else create this game instead of Infinity Ward was a giant mistake.  This latest edition adds nothing to the series.  Do not purchase this game....there are many better games out there
The magazine was shipped in a timely manner, I would use this vendor again
  The overall impression is that of a game made on the rush. --- Assuming the "good" alignment, you win simply by building expensive  buildings at the edge of your influence zone and burning the enemy's platoons sent by a very unintelligent AI. Since winning requires no strategy, the game is challenging; you can do basically the same on all levels.  ---  ---    The races against which one fights are pretty much the same except for their "skins" and the building's aspect. Defeating them all takes you at most 8 hours of gameplay.  ---  ---   Unlike the previous version of B&W, there are no custom campaigns nor multiplayer features. Cinematics and creature apart, it looks like a very primitive first version of "Age of Empires". ---  ---  ---      ---  ---  ---    ---    ---  ---  
I purchased 5 of the Anvil SS Henleys in assorted colors not long ago.  Out of the box, they were good quality.  After 2 washes, however, they have shrunk drastically to the point that they cannot be tucked in anymore.  My personal opinion... waste of money
I'm sorry but this is one of the worst perfumes.  I seriously can spray myself about 10 times and within 30 minutes you can't smell a thing.  yes the scent is great, I love it.  But the only person who has the opportunity to smell it is me.  Really really disapointed.  I guess I'm just used to the Channel and Ralph Lauren lines.  They are quality and can last most of the day.  This stuff is plan old junk like most of the new stuff coming out these days. 
I bought this cable to connect 50" Plasma TV to computer. When we connected the cable with TV we could not get it to display computer screen. We spent 2 hours with Plasma manufacturer on telephone troubleshooting the connection. At the end, at our dissapointment, we found out that the cable was defective. When we tried different cable everything worked
Everyone in my family is enamored with this fantastic Darth Vader mask. We bought it initially for my son, who is Darth Vader obsessed, but it's quickly become the house favorite. (Even Grandpa can't resist putting this mask on and pretending to be Darth for a spell.)  ---  --- On another note: we keep this helmet on our bookshelf in the living room and it makes a great conversation piece. It is so realistic looking and it makes a menacing piece of art on display
Although this isn't the most polished movie, it is genuinely entertaining, and only someone not remotely interested in seeing a romantic comedy would give it 0-1 stars. ---  --- I can't remember why I first picked it up (I didn't see it in the theaters), but it is a consistently funny, touching film.  I'm not a fan of Sarah Jessica Parker, Elle MacPherson (who I feel turns in the strangest, poorest performance of the bunch), or even Ben Stiller, but I think it's easy to identify with people so afraid to be in love, but so afraid not to be in a committed relationship. ---  --- All in all, it's a bunch of laughs, and kind of a relief to watch something that takes itself less seriously than some of the big-name romantic comedies that are put out today and fall flat
I love my coffee machine but I normally do not buy t-discs from Gevalia due to price.  But found this on Amazon = Wow 2 for 1!  --- Price is great, even when you add in any cost for shipping etc.  Still beats "Bead Bath & Beyond" with a coupon!  Service and delivery were excellent
This Yakima roof rack system works great and I highly recommend it. The Fairing definitely makes the ride a lot quieter, anyone who doesn't like "wooshing" should buy one without hesitation. I bought one for my Mazda 3 and have used it, along with a Yakima roof rack for 2 cross country ski trips (I live a Florida, skiing is far away). The rack hasn't shifted an inch and was relatively easy to install. Yakima has a product guide on their site to make sure you order the right pieces for your model car
Which was Nomadland.  The Bono-pod is beautiful.  However the inconsistency of the iPod itself is a nightmare.  I've had it just over a month now and it has started to randomly skip songs.  It's apparently a known problem with several models of the device, with no particular fix.  Great. 
Not only are these shoes great looking on...they are extremely comfortable.  I went back and bought two addtional pairs in different colors
The projection was too small and not bright enough.  The clock was a pain in the neck to set.  I have many of these type clocks and this one was a dissapointment.  I returned it
I ordered this cushion for my rather large desk chair at work- and it works great!  The foam is very thick, but conforms to the body to support it well.  The cushion is tapered at the front to prevent pressure on the legs.  I would highly recommend this to improve posture and support while working at a desk.  I am buying a second one to keep at home so when I work at my kitchen table on my laptop I am at the proper height.   ---  --- I also am an adult with ADHD Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and find this cushion allows me to sit for longer periods of time without becoming restless.  I also used to find myself sitting on my leg or heel, but with the cushion I am better at keeping both feet on the ground while I am sitting at my desk or table. ---  --- Kensington makes great products- I also love the Kensington laptop stand for my desk at school that I also ordered on Amazon as well
I agree that this is technically an excellent film.  But it is also unrelentingly grim and without a payoff of any kind.  Given the lowlifes who inhabit this story its hard not to sympathize a bit with Richard Widmark's character.  His enthusiasm is as boundless as his optimism.  But in the end he doesn't just lose; he is literally thrown away as garbage.   ---  --- And then there is the wrestling scene which was so gruesome it was hard to take.  All in all, I was left with the question, what is the point? ---  --- The commentary leaves a lot to be desired as well.  Its basicly a description of what you're watching, while you're watching it. ---  --- I see everyone regards this as a masterpiece so I'll watch it again but as film noir goes there is something very unsatisfying about this movie. 
I absolutely love this magazine! This is a wonderful read for any who like short stories and mysteries! The magazine includes new writers as well as more well known ones. A wonderful magazine
This is a minimalist kit which isn't really suited for everyone, it is also overpriced for the items in it. What it is good for is to get you thinking what YOU need in your survival kit and to understand that you can make it very compact. Overall it's a good starting point and a lot better then nothing
The price is too high, considering the Ijoy 550 model is only US$599.99 at Sharper Image
The watch obviously looks nice and the links have a nice, unique design. Unfortunately I have had terrible issues with the pins between the links. There are multiple links that wiggle out throughout the day and I have to shimmy them back in all day long. I tried having this issue addressed with a jeweler but it didn't last. This is the kind of issue I would expect from an inferior watch, perhaps one well under 100 bucks.
One warning for users with over head lights.  The 6000 keyboard that has tranparent (light gray) keys is very hard to read if the lighting is not quite right.  I have a light directly above my desk  and the reflected glare off the keys makes all the letters and numbers disappear.  Go for a black key or similar model
You can try this for free for up to 60 days by registering with Microsoft and downloading an evaluation copy. When you're sure you want it, permanently activate it with the product key you get in your Amazon package. ---  --- The new version of Excel has two huge advantages: ---  --- 1. It removes the old 256 column/65,536 row limitation.  You can now have 16,384 columns and more than a million rows.   ---  --- 2. Excel 2007 can use all the cores/processors in your computer (or you can restrict it to use only some, so huge background calculations do not tie up your machine).  On my dual core computer, Excel 2007 is **way** faster than 2003 at almost every task. ---  --- I've seen no crashes, hangs, or hiccups. ---  --- But everything else about Excel 2007 is frustrating.  The new "ribbon" interface is unnecessary and awkward -- almost every operation takes more pointing and clicking than older releases. Bypassing the ribbon with the new "Quick Access Toolbar" is problematic because (bizarrely) Microsoft has deleted many distinctive command icons, leaving them with identical green circles. ---  --- Right now Excel 2003 costs more than Excel 2007.  If the two plusses don't help you, you may think that 2003 is worth more
I currently have two feeders in the back yard for the hummingbirds.  I love the way this one looks but the birds don't feed from it and I'm not sure why.  The other one will be empty and they still don't come to this one
nice shirt.  very hard to find in stores so it's worth the wait and the cash
I was very excited to get these bowls in the mail because they are so cute, and the concept of having a suction bowl was (and is) appealing to me. My son loved the bowl right away, as he was able to reach into the bowl for some puffs to feed himself instead of having to push the puffs around the table until he could finally grab one in his fingers. I'd also like to add that he ate tofu cubes for the first time out of this bowl and loved them! However, I'm disappointed because the suction on the bowl does not work for more than a few seconds. I'm constantly pushing the bowl back down, which is disruptive to his meal. Despite some of happy memories I've had with this bowl, I would not recommend buying these bowls because as 'suction bowls' they do not serve their purpose
I was overwhelmed by the choices, and selected this model, in part, because of the reasonal price.  I had read reviews which mentioned problems and the need to return the product, but I decided there was only a small possibility of that happening.   ---  --- The instructions said to use the lowest setting initially, which certainly made sense.  However, the INSTRUCTIONS said to move the adjustment "toward the tip", which turned out to be the highest, not the lowest setting!  The diagram on the handle indicated that the movement was toward the LARGER opening, but I read the directions and did not look at the diagram until later.  The spray was very powerful and actually "hurt", especially when it was by my tooth with a crown.   ---  --- The next day I tried adjusting the settings with the pik over my sink, not in my mouth!  It felt wonderful on the lower setting!  I reread the directions again (and again over the next several days) to see if the error was mine or theirs.  I still think the directions were not written properly.  The third day I had trouble getting any spray at all.  This continued for about a week, some days getting more or less, but never a full spray ON ANY SETTING!  My guess is that it was in a permanent "pause" mode. I gave up and pursued returning the item.  It needed to be returned to an "authorized repair", which luckily was only a few miles away (there were only three in my state).  The repair man had told me, over the phone, it was a discontinued model and hadn't been made in about  a year.  When he looked at it, he found it had been made in 2006.  He said he could fix it, but wasn't allowed to; I am awaiting a replacement to arrive in the mail. 
This was the second tribe album i bought i was gonna get this cd before i got the low end theory but they didn't have it at the best buy i went to. I like this cd a lot but i like midnight mauraders more because phife got some more rap time and i like phife a little more than tip. Most people like tip more but i like phifes style a lot. All like all the songs but the most is luck of lucein, afterhours, foot prints, i left my wallet in el segundo, bonita applebum, can i kick it, rhythm, go ahead in the rain, and description of a fool. Man i pratically like all the tracks but the most remeberable. I wish they were still going to make another cd but its just tip coming out with another solo cd. The only complaint is that phife was only in a couple songs. This is one of my favorite rap albums with the jazz and r and b mix with the lyrics which makes this a absoulte must have for any hip hop fan is part of the tribe classics.  
If you are only starting your trek into the world of serious coffee appreciation, then I highly suggest you, without haste, purchase one pound at least of whole bean JBM. Also a good grinder, a temperature controlled machine and a decent water filtration system. Pre-ground takes much of the flavor away, compaired to properly done fresh home ground coffee, and coffee is lessened without being prepaired at the correct temperature of filtered water. ---  --- But why something so expensive? Why jump in to the deep end of the pool before even getting your feet wet?  ---  --- Some may scoff, saying that only a true coffee fanatic would understand or be able to appreciate this blend. That is entirely true. But how can anyone really understand without first having tasted the standard by which all others must be judged? ---  --- Thus why this review is only four out of five stars. You see, JBM is so subtle, so complex, that a new tounge will not notice what makes JBM quite so wonderful. ---  --- It is a "perfectly" blended coffee. Flavor, bitterness, acidity and aftertaste. On a scale of one to ten, they all rank dead even at five. Every other coffee is like a exaggeration of this hard to get bean. ---  --- This should be the first coffee to ever cross the lips of anyone who wants to learn these things. How else can you truely understand the other blends
To begin, I am not a big fan of Cary Grant, EXCEPT in his Hitchcock movies, where he was excellent. And I enjoy him much with Katharine Hepburn in Bringing Up Baby. He was very good in The Eagle and the Hawk with Fredric March. He was tolerable in The Philadelphia Story and Talk of the Town. A friend of mine loaned me this DVD; she just bought it. I had wanted to see what Cary would do in this film, and I wanted to see him in the dress. From the start, the movie was SLOW and BORING, all the jokes were so lame and not at all funny. I also don't go for films where the man and woman yell at each other and dislike each other, and then at some point realize it is really love they feel for each other. Come on! I just can't understand that sort of romance situation. I felt Cary showed that "mean streak" he can show in some of his films, in the romance situation of this story. I rate this one star because it was one of those films you get bored with right from the beginning and it is sort of torture waiting for it to finally end. All the while I kept saying, "Let's move along, let's end this thing, when does he put on the dress?..." but they dragged it out on and on and on and on with boring,corny jokes. And the part we wanted to see, Cary in the dress, was at the VERY end and not very much at that. Overall, this film was a real disappointment and letdown. The only consolation was that I saw it for free; I didn't have to buy it or rent it. Still, I wasted good time that I could have used in a more profitable and enjoyable way. I would even have enjoyed washing a kitchen full of dirty dishes more than watching this movie!  To sum it up, a VERY VERY BORING and DUMB movie, not to waste your time on.
This little device is easy to put together and easy to use.  Not for 'intensive' workouts however, you can pretty much use it anyplace you're sitting down.  That could mean even while the TV is on!  Like all exercise equipment, if you don't use it you lose it
What happened to this book?  It is a disgrace to the star wars universe.  It's practically a Star Wars dictionary, that's all.  In spite of the good pictures, this book was very disappointing!!!
These little flosser tips put an end to my problem with bleeding gums.  Flossing with traditional floss hurt because I always cut myself and deeply.  It probably saved me from serious gum disease, and that I understand is expensive to treat, so I'd rather put out a few dollars rather than a few thousand dollars in keeping teeth and gums healthy
We bought this dollhouse, because when we went to the store, it had an adorable display and looked like a step up from the Twintime Dollhouse, which has very small rooms.  You could press the button on the display, and the people would talk to each other.  My kids thought it would be great.  When we were at Toys R Us, I looked for accessory furniture/people/animal sets to go along with this dollhouse.  I did not see any.  I thought it was probably due to Christmas just having passed.  We got home, opened the dollhouse and discovered that there really were not many phrases that the provided people/furnitureanimal did, so I went to Amazon to try to find more sets in order to achieve the purpose of this dollhouse (to get the 200 phrases). Thats when reality set in that we had just made a huge mistake.  You cannot find ANY accesory pieces for this set.  You can go on Ebay and pay many times more than the original price for USED furniture.  I was really disappointed.  I even tried the Fisher Price website, only to find that they are marketing the Twintime Dollhouse furniture for this Sweet Sounds Dollhouse.  What a shame and a sham....  I really like Fisher Price toys and we have many, but I am very disappointed in the fact that they are trying to fool the consumer.  What good is a dollhouse, if you cannot get it to accomplish what it says it will do---200 phrases.  Not to mention, what is included with the Sweet Sounds Dollhouse is not much.  Just a Mom, Dad, girl, baby, swing, cradle, radio, cat, and a scant few more pieces.  Definately not enough to keep the kids interested for long! ---  --- There are actually three Fisher Price dollhouses that are still available, this one, the Twintime Dollhouse, and the one we eventually ended up buying at Value City (also available on Ebay)--the Fisher Price Special Edition Townhouse.  It has a doorbell that rings, doors that open, birds that sing, phone that rings, lights that come on, fridge light comes on, computer lights up(and is part of a desk set attached to the dollhouse), and a fireplace that crackles and lights up (which is also attached to the dollhouse).  These things are all ON THE DOLLHOUSE itself.  No accesory furniture or people are needed to make this happen.  The battery replacement compartment is on the back on this dollhouse not the bottom, like the Sweet Sounds one.  The front of the Townhouse has flower boxes with likelike flowers you place in them (comes with the set).  You can get it A LOT cheaper than the Sweet Sounds Dollhouse, too (almost half the cost). It comes with a great deal of furniture:  2 beds with pillows and comforters and blankets, a lawnchair, 3 people, potted plant, real curtains, kitchen table and chairs, clothing for the people, computer chair, lounge chair and more.  The kitchen counter, stove, microwave and fridge are part of the dollhouse.  It also has closet doors that open and stairs the people can walk up.  You practically do not need to buy anything else, but if you do, you can get the Loving Family accesory people and furniture sets.  This dollhouse is so much larger to boot.  There is plenty of room to put everything. It shuts and closes together just like the Sweet Sounds, but it is clearly larger.  We also thought about the Twintime, but it had too many comments on how small the rooms were and the display at Toys R Us looked jammed packed.  I did not know how more than one child could play with it and not have a shoving match, because they could not play, as well. ---  --- My kids absolutely the Townhouse with all of its sounds, especially the doorbell.  The great thing about it is that these are greatly reduced in price, because they are an older model, which is what they should do with the Sweet Sounds Dollhouse.  Let the public know ahead of time, so their kids do not get disappointed, because it does not live up to what it says at the store. Thank Goodness I was able to take mine back, because I had my receipt and box.  Be careful and keep the box and receipt if you do choose to buy this dollhouse even after all of the warnings, because after your kids see that it does not do what it says and because it is on the small side compared with the Townhouse version, they may not want to keep it. When we took ours back, a Toys R Us worker stopped and talked to us and agreed that Fisher Price is just trying to get rid of their extra stock of Sweet Sounds Dollhouses. Unfortunately, it is at the consumers expense and disappointment!! 
This is our first fire pit, and it seems to work great.  It is not too heavy so it can be moved around our patio and it looks nice.  The only downside, and I think this is true of all firepits, is that the bowl fills up with water when it rains and makes quite a mess in there.  I find myself cleaning the bowl more often than I'd like, but otherwise is a great
All of the bags were stale, however Amazon's customer service quickly corrected the issue by giving me a refund. I think the whole batch was stale
I always thought the laborious interviews in turbotax were pretty ridiculous, now I've seen the opposite. Taxcut online seems totally not thorough, such as just asking for total of certain things, and not asking if special circumstances apply, which you don't miss at all until you have one of them. I had almost completely finished my taxes and got to the business use of home. I moved half way through the year. I couldn't find where to add an additional home office listing. "Nope, can't do it" said support after an hour long chat session of mostly waiting, "you'll have to use another product." So today I start from scratch and pay the $99 ransom that turbotax is charging small business owners. I encourage the competition to get their shizzle together next year. --- s:
I ordered this magazine on 10/7/06 (over three months ago) and haven;t received a single copy yet!!! STINKY SERVICE!!
Drills are excellent, vocabulary has good variety... Picking up the grammar from the application without explanation is tough for me, but I guess that's the way kids learn any language.
I absolutely love Atlantis. From Ronon Dex, to Sheppard, and to all the faces. I'd cry if Atlantis was cancelled. Seriously though, Steve should have never have died, he should also have been put in command of SG1. Can you imagine that..."Why Steve, welcome to Earth...you're welcome to live out your life, if you only feed in self defense on enemies...'kay? Oh, you're also in charge of Sg1. :P" But seriously, the Wraith make this show so awesome. From Steve to Bob to Edward, to Gordon and Alexander, to Michael and Eric (by far James's best performance yet). ---  --- The Wraith make this show what it is. But one thing??? Why don't we have Before I Sleep? Seriously, you have no idea how irked I am at that, since I began watching in S.2.12. ---  --- Anyways, I think Atlantis totally pwns SG1
Very nice bag and well made.   ---  --- However, I bought it for the Canon DC100 DVD camcorder and found it a little small for carrying all the equipment (cords and charger). 
If you are looking for complete information about the training or fitness activity and want to analyze to improve your performance or avoid overtraining this is the unit. --- - Very nice software, a lot of nice information very well presented --- - Speed sensor is reliable and accurate (does not suffer all kind of interfence such as GPS units) - error is really smaller than 5% even during long runs --- - The information available during and after the exercise is great (temperature, altitude, calorie count, all HRM metrics such as average, maximum, %) --- - Bike sensor provides speed, distance, etc --- - Fitness test is a nice measure of improvemen
The magazines ordered through amazon take an ETERNITY to be delivered.  The estimated time for my delivery was April after I had placed the order in Feb.  That's a long enough wait as it is---I ended up receiving it the the end of June!  And when I called to complain...the customer service rep explained to me that it was technically within the estimated allowed time for delivery.  so bottom line...if you have an urge to order a magazine that may take half a year or so to get to you...then this is the ONE FOR YOU-hands down.  I plan on never ordering a single magazine through Amazon again.  Definitely don't send a subscription to anyone as a birthday gift- it'll maybe make it in time for the FOLLOWING birthday year..so plan years in advance
My daughter bought this with birthday money and it jammed on the first day she played with it. We can't get the sticker roll out and she is very disappointed. Don't bother with this toy. Buy a better one made for scrapbooking. The look on my daughter's face when this broke was heart-breaking
The videos are not useable except in the Leapfrog Leapster.  I did not know that until I received the order!  Thanks alot Leapfrog.
After looking at $250.00 mounts, I was unsure about order at this low price.  This is a great, well built unit. I would have no problem putting --- a 130 lb. unit on it if you follow the enclosed instructions.  Hardware  --- for most walls included.  Well painted with no rough edges.  Mine was installed over wall board into wood studs.  I used the awl to make sure I hit the studs dead center. Delivery from New York to Sarasota, Fl. was 5 days.  Can't bet that
Ok, I don't have this doll, I won't buy this doll...If I ever have a little girl she will never have anything like this. I saw some girls saying how the doll was appropriate for 10-13 and I almost fell out of my chair! This doll is -IN-appropriate for someone under 21! The short skirts the short tops. How the heck can Mattel think that this was a good idea? I'm 23 years old and I would NEVER dress like that NOR would I allow my CHILD to dress like that. Bottom line: SHAME ON YOU MATTEL!!
I remember listening to this years ago, and I thought I would add this to my cd library, now I know why it has been years sense I've listened to it,, very sqeaky, dull, slow paced stuff, Bob Segar makes this stuff sound like tin foil..
The book I am going to talk about is the book Arms and the Man By Bernard Shaw. I really did not like this book because it was hard for me to understand.  The reason I didn't like it was because it was challenging for me. The English was hard to understand. I liked how the writer wrote the book and I would probably look for another one of his books. This book was more like an opera with out music. If I could have and known to I probably would not have this enthusiastic about the book. One reason I picked the book was because it was dealing with war and I thought it would have been cool to read about war, but when I got more in to the book it was really not about war it was more about a love at war. If you're an older audience it would be a good book, or if you're looking for a good love-war story.
Our son has an especially strong startle reflex, and has to be swaddled to sleep, at all.  At 2.5 weeks, he startled being able to get out of any swaddle we did, no matter how expertly done, no matter what blanket we used.  So, at 1 hour of sleep, he'd start crying and we'd have to go in and start all over.  We searched online for actual "Swaddling" blankets and based on reviews, chose this one.  WHAT AN UTTER MIRACLE. We are in such debt to the dad who created this!  Our son is now 12 weeks old, and we use this for each nap and for nighttime sleep.  He was sleeping 6-7 hour stretches at 5 weeks, and slept 11 hours at 8 weeks.  We would never have this success without this blanket.  We've periodically tried to get him to sleep without it, but his reflex is STILL so strong that he needs it.  It took a little "getting used to" the method to get him wrapped up, but in no time we both were experts.  And the price on Amazon, with free shipping, is way better than what we paid directly through AMB.  I wholeheartedly reccommend this to all parents, especially new parents. 
I see that "Linda" has already laid down the exact same review for all the colors and all the nibs of this pen, so there's not much new I can tell you other than, (1)  To confirm what she wrote, and (2), to add a few new details. ---  --- This is an excellent introduction to fountain pens for those with hesitancy about buying one.  I've collected a few vintage and new fountain pens over the years; some of them lay in a display box, loved but unused. On contrast, you will use this pen!  It's incredibly cheap for the quality, so you get a basically positive experience (smooth flowing liquid expression) without the price, or the ultimate cost...losing the darn thing.  At prices ranging from $40 to $400 and beyond (Amazon.com sells a Namiki fountain pen for well over $4,000), the habitual loser of inanimate objects would be understandably reluctant to invest in a gold-nibbed, laquered objet-d'art, and would opt instead for this beautiful cheaply that even CALLS itself "disposable!"  ---  ---  --- It's a personal preference, but I'd opt for the fine nib over the medium if you're going to use this everyday--you'll write faster and use less ink. The medium is nice for big John Hancock-ish signatures and weighty thoughts, but you lose a little expression (those personal shadings and slight angles that even the untrained can't help but produce). The steel nib writes surprisingly smoothly, and as mentioned above, the ink doesn;t evaporate too quickly.  You can't refill the pen (it's DISPOSABLE just because of that), but you can buy several in different colors and nib sizes, and get some idea of what kind of pen suits you.   ---  --- If and when you feel like you want to purchase a re-fillable fountain pen, try for something under $50.  Levenger.com's excellent "True Writer" and the "Retro" brand pens sell for about this much.  Although those liquidy smooth gel pens have taken some over some of the non-ballpoint market, the mechanically-minded will enjoy the physics of bottle-filling a pen; others will simpy dig the tradition of using a pen with a rich history.  When it comes to fountain pens, the "P" is for panache.
This was a huge waste of money. If you have plans to make a custom animation, do not buy this.  Anime only alows you to manipulate one of their few charecters.  You can not change eye color or hair color.  If you want a good animation you have to go to one of their websites and purchase a character for $10- $20.  Their free ones are completly dumb. Using their "easy to use" bone rigging tool takes a long time to set up and use.  It took me ten minutes to make one for a stick figure. (which didn't work very well) You can't even group anything unless you buy their $180 upgraded version.  I  spent hours trying to use this, and could figure none of the above out.  It also took two weeks to get here instead of four days.  I don't recomend this to people who are looking for an easy to use animation creator.
I expected a sage or mint to come in the package when I ordered this since it was the vague green used for children but it is lacking.  I don't like bright colors so that is not where this is coming from but the color is just not right.  Kiwi is bette
What does WILD THINGS 2 have going against it from the get-go: --- A) No Denise Richards  B) No name actors  C)Being a crappy direct-to-video sequel  D)No Denise Richards NAKED . . .  ---  --- What is wrong with WILD THINGS 2 after the fact:   --- A)A script that tries to overcompensate its idiocy with more twists than a corkscrew  B)ONE sex scene -- A (weak) threesome, one of the few things even linking this to the original C)Sexy actresses who star in a sexy movie but decide not to be naked (leaving us with a body double and naked-from-behind shot) . . . Wait let me play that again! ---  --- If I seem to be dwelling a little too much on the sexuality aspects of this film maybe its because this is an EROTIC THRILLER. ---  --- Did I mention no Denise Richards?
My 3 1/2 year old son has older sisters with iPods and always wants to use them to listen to.  We bought this for him for Christmas and he calls it his iPod and he absolutely loves it.  We download new songs and stories from time to time as a reward.  We also bought the speakers for him to listen to stories or songs while going to sleep or just hanging out at home. ---  --- It's tough and durable and withstands being dropped and rough handling like a 3 year old dips out
I purchased this as a gift for my 56-year-old mother who simply can't get enough Scrabble with her friends. While I did not get the opportunity to use the product myself, she seems quite enthusiastic about its abilities. ---  --- Just make sure your opponents approve and dont think you are trying to cheat.
This fragrance is ok for the teen princesses. This scent doesn't linger and is too subtle. Not as nice as vera wang Vanity or Sheer Veil. I don't recommend this unless you are 16 and under. I gave it to my 11 year old and she loves it
This product is not what it is cracked up to be.  I ordered it, and it doesn't really work too well, i think a button with a piece of elastic would be better.  There is not enough expansion room , its just like not really using anything at all.  Sorry, but i thought the product was not that good. 
I have looked at many photography magazines - many of them are just filled with ads....not what an amateur is looking for. I wanted indepth articles, helpful tips and information to help me improve my craft. I found it here. I read every issue cover to cover and back again. I find helpful information in every issue. I highly recommend this magazine - even if you aren't purely an "outdoor" photographer
This costume kit was a great deal for the price.  My son loves it
I bought this program for my 11 yr old granddaughter and she has very quickly learned the keyboard. I wanted her to learn the correct way to type before she developed bad hunt and peck habits. So much homework now requires typed reports. She had fun with it. It's a great program!
Not only is this beauty wide, I have found the lens is very sharp to on my D200! It is built solid and focus's fast, and I don't have any problem with distortion because I use DXO Optics software and it cleans it up automaticly! Buy this lens, it is cheap for what you get
I originally bought the Blue (5 lb), Red (7 lb) and the Black (9 lb) Gripmasters for my 14 year old boys. The Blue is a little too easy for gripping but excellent for exercising the ring and little finger. The Blue was too easy for them so they did not use it so I ended inherited it. It is pretty habit forming and fun to use because the tension is light, this makes it good for use anytime, anywhere. (I have used it stuck in traffic and it is also a good stress reliever) If I had to do it again, I would have probably not bought this tension unless you have a very light grip, probably have started with the Red. Just remember that this is mainly for fingers and hand exercise so very easy to use for gripping, the challenge is working out the fingers. It is not like using the regular heavy hand grippers. It has increased my hand strength and grip just by having it with me and using it during the course of the day without planned workouts. Great product, excellent for finger or hand exercise, good quality
I gave this camera 5 stars because of it's awesome features. This camera is the perfect size for kids and you can put a video on this camera. I love this camera. I think it takes awesome pictures
This is very comfy and pretty and a great price . Try it you will be sold. I am glad I did
bad shoe for sure. it is not for running. but want a cheap shoe for some dirty yard work. this may d
This stuff is great!  Healthier and tastier than any other pasta that I've tried, (except for my mother in laws homemade)
What a beautiful magazine (full color pictures on glossy paper), and what interesting stories behind each food.  The recipes are sometimes doable, although most of the time I just like to read about the exotic ingredients in each. ---  --- A must have- makes the living room look very sophisticated
This is an excellent, general purpose microphone at a reasonable price.  I'm a classically trained vocalist, and I use the SM58 for rehearsal and "scratch" recordings.  It delivers clear, true, and warm sound under all standard conditions and requires essentially no fine tuning or signal processing.  I still prefer the crisp detail of a condenser microphone for formal demo recordings (my favorite is the Studio Projects C1), but it's hard to beat the simplicity and reliability of the SM58 for everyday use
I'm making an exception to my usual practice of not reviewing anything on amazon, due to the utter vileness of this movie.  I saw it when it came out in theaters and hated it, and then a friend purchased the DVD and convinced me to give it a second chance...  all in all, this movie ended up taking about four hours of my life that I will never get back. ---  --- The performances are thin and uneven, the plot is inconsistent, and the dialogue sounds like it was pulled from fortune cookies made by the cast of Friends.  To be fair, this movie does face several major obstacles.  It has the misfortune to depend on the "acting" of glorified Ken doll Freddie Prinze, Jr. and the vastly overrated Julia Stiles, and in addition to trying to rise above these challenges, it also attempts to survive the intrusion of Ashton Kutcher.  It fails on all counts.   ---  --- I do not hate the whole romantic comedy genre; nor do I hate the "teen" movie sub-genre, under which some would place "Down to You."  (In fact, "Can't Hardly Wait" is one of my favorite movies.)  I simply hate BAD movies, and this movie is a true abomination.  If you enjoy the experience of wanting to drill into your own skull, then by all means, buy this DVD.  If, however, you value your sanity, then please do not make the same mistake I did; stay far, FAR away from this movie
I just opened my dock kit and began to assemble and the included battery is too big for the C743 camera.  The battery must be for one of the older cameras that is bigger.  I think it's odd, as the camera dock series 3 is the correct camera dock.  I'm disappointed with my purchase and wasted the money that went toward the battery.  I don't know whether the dock works okay, because I didn't get that far.  This is my second easyshare camera and dock and I was very happy with the first one.  Now I have to buy another battery
I've used PaperPort 9 for about 3 years, currently running under Win XP. I love it, my wife loves it, I have bought it for my kids, and recommend it to others. A lawyer friend of mine raves about it. I've had no problems with it. (I had to  downlaod and install an upgrade, but more recent production probably has the upgrade already incorporated.) I download bank and credit card statements and other documents to it from the Internet; I store faxed documents in it; I scan checks before I deposit them; I use it to convert documents to pdf so I can e-mail them. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I wish it were more convenient to do a couple of things; maybe V. 10 adds those features, but for the money, V.9 is a bargain. I just wish I had a faster scanner (what do you expect for $60?) so I could get rid of more paper documents. Highly recommended as a start toward the paperless office
I also own the Bundle me w/fluffy heavy winter liner & we could not have lived without it! I was excited to see this trendy,light-weight, weather resistant version for spring. I'll admit I would not have purchased this had it not been on the wrong shelf at $39.99. My $59.99 dismay soon evaporated-it is so sleek and functional!  No more struggling with bulky snowsuits, jackets and sweaters (which never seem to fit baby anyway)  Easily unzips so as not to overheat.  LOVE the little pocket for binky.  Velcro back openings make it easy to switch to stroller (No need to buy two!)    ---  
The bed lift system is OK if all you want to do is sit up in bed and read. However, I did not like the way it bounced when trying to sleep on it and the edges or sides would collapse if you weren't centered in the bed
this has to be the best beanie that i have ever purchased...i wear it all the time, it fits perfectly and looks awesome!
My friend was very happy with them.  They are very good quality, and they fit him for the most part.  The only issue we had was the length of the arms.  They were a little too long.  Other than that, we were pleased.  They got here in time for Christmas, and they were just what he wanted
you can purchase this item at most any Walmart or K-mart ETC...for $4.99 or cheaper..toywiz is ripping people off!!!
Where are the DVDs?  I'm STILL waiting!  I want it all, but especially the second season.   ---  --- I'd rather not have them done on both sides of the disc.  I want good quality discs, not too many episodes on each, please.  However, I'll take what I can get.  Just put it on DVD, PLEASE! --- 
I bought into a subscription of this magazine sight unseen.  That was a bad decision.  After having received two issues, I continue to be disappointed.  The quality of the art & design, and products displayed overall are dreadfully amateurish and in most cases incredibly tacky. I would be hard pressed to think that anyone in pursuit of help with romanticing their home would be inspired by this magazine. 
Everything is fine, except I was a bit irritated by shedding...it leaves bristles on my face, and they get into the razor.  I hope it will pass with time, as other reviewers reported.  Foaming action is very good, and badger bristle is much more pleasent to the touch than boar. ---  --- I'll report again on this item in few months
Solid, familiar and dependable.  Although, I wish there was an option to only update the specific income information from the prior year without going through the extensive interview
This router has been in operation for about 3 weeks.  When it is functioning correctly, it is a pleasure to use.  Unfortunately, it requires almost daily power cycling to keep it running - all the idiot lights show normal operation, but there's no wired or wireless connectivity until it's power cycled
Don't buy Vista--any version, yet.  MS released it WAY too early.  Some examples why:   ---  --- * Too many hardware drivers not yet available, i.e., Creative Audigy  sound cards; Nvidia graphics cards, and Linksys wireless network components, just to mention a few.  When I contacted product manufacturers, I sensed a ho-hum attitude.  Moreover, some peripherals are totally incompatible.  Example:  My Epson Perfection 1650 scanner was rejected by Vista, so I was forced to buy a newer model (Epson Perfection 4990 Photo).  Hmmmm.  One wonders whether these sorts of incompatibilities result more by design (purposely?) than from insurmountable technological deficiencies. ---  --- *  Too many Vista compatible application updates are not yet available.  ---  --- *  The "Upgrade" versions of MS Vista (versus the "full" versions) seem to be full of bugs.  Soon after I installed Vista Ultimate, I encountered a major problem that MS tech support has been trying to resolve for over two weeks.  It is so pervasive that MS Outlook 2007 has been affected to the extent that some of its features are not available.  It appears that during the installation process, something went awry with "Windows Event Log" and the "Event Viewer."  Furthermore, the latest version (Vista compatible) of Diskeeper 2007 Pro will not launch, most likely for the same reason.  ---  --- *  It appears MS went way overboard on security features to the extent of paranoia.  Every time you click on just about anything, a pop-up will appear asking your permission to "allow" it to launch.  Very annoying, and VERY unnecessary.  It's as though MS adopted an underlying assumption throughout the development process that the average end user has an IQ of about 85.  ---  --- *  MS tech support quality has deteriorated substantially.  Most of the time when you call you will reach someone in India.  Albeit these people are very polite, they cannot think "outside the box."  Nor are they in touch sufficiently enough with the nuances of the English language, thus impairing expeditious understanding on both sides of the conversation.  Based upon my recent experience with these folks, I sense that a soccer mom could be trained as a MS tech support rep in very little time. What I mean by that is this:  During my multiple contacts with them I developed the feeling they rely totally on reading from manuals, scripts, and on-line knowledge bases.  In other words, they seem not to be able to analyze and troubleshoot problems independent of external references.   ---  --- * Bottom line:  Do NOT purchase Vista until AFTER service pack 1 is released, or whatever they happen to name their first major fix-it update package.  For now, stay with the more reliable XP versions.  I truly regret that I had to discover all of this the hard way.  It has been very costly in more ways than one.
Good quality product at very reasonable price. Postage was quick even though I'm in the UK. All round good service
Simply stated,if you want a politically correct magazine that panders to the socialistic academic minority, buy the mag. I'll pass and go online to the authors ignored and enjoy reading about the real new horizons
My problems with nextel did not stop when I canceled my service. I will get to the problems with the service. When I went to get a new phone a day before my contract expired, I of course wanted to keep my number. So as I went to get my Cingular phone (highly recommended), I had the old number switched to my new number. Today, I get in the mail my nextel statement for the month with a $200 early termination even though I had not canceled my service, but had simply got a new phone and switched my number over. This was on icing on the cake after 2 years of absolutely amazingy bad service from nextel. In my town, not a small town by any means, there are very few places that have any service. In the largest subdivision, you cannot get service anywhere. I constantly get comments from people trying to reach me that get the classic nextel line...Please hold while the nextel subscriber you are trying to reach is located. Most of the time I would not even recieve incoming calls, calls would go straight to my voice mail. Not only would I not get the calls, but often I would not even get the voice mails until days or even weeks later. When I did actually take calls (and call out), I cannot count the number of times I've had my call dropped. I recieved so many different error messages sometimes I wonder if they just spend all their time at nextel thinking of different error messages to program into their phones. That brings me to the selling point of nextel, the famed and well-loved direct connect feature. This is an absolute joke. Direct connect only works MAYBE half the time I tried to use it. Even then, in the middle of the conversation I would be greeted by the loud beep of my phone telling me I wont be talking to that person anymore. Of course, I would expect nothing less from the nextel network. Text messaging with nextel is next to impossible. If it did not take hours to send or recieve a message, it took days, or maybe didn't even come at all. The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked. Of course, when you don't have service, you don't get the internet access either. I was constantly getting the message "network not available". Calling and trying to complain to nextel is futile. Trying to get through to customer service takes forever and once you get through they do nothing. My experience with nextel has been nothing short of a disaster and I write this trying to warn anyone considering nextel. Stick with Verizon or Cingular and you will be much happier in the end. Don't make the same mistake I did.
I enjoyed this movie a lot. Hugh Jackman and Ashley Judd are both very appealing in these roles, and Greg Kinnear does a nice job with his as well - the jerk who's just so charming that you can't resist, even when you know better than to fall for it. Ellen Barkin does fine with her small role but it is weird that she is the one listed first
I bought this buggy board because I was told it was better than my previous wood buggy board (wheel kept unscrewing)... however, I have two strollers I like to use so I had to pay 30 extra dollars to get a second set of connectors to attach it to my second board.  Today I called customer service because one strap broke... I was told it is normal if you live in a cold climate - in my case Manhattan - for the rubber to snap and break...?????? - luckily my daughter was not on it at the time! I was told not to use it in cold weather... I only use it on the weekends anyway so it's not out a lot and it snapped in less than three months.  Please save yourself money and grief and get another board
For the price this is not a bad keyboard.  Here are the two major problems I have with it: ---  --- 1) The feel is nothing like a real piano.  The keys are springy and you have to apply a fair amount of pressure to hold a note. ---  --- 2) The instructions have a big sticker on them, stating that this keyboard is made of materials known to cause cancer and/or birth defects (including lead) and to "wash your hands after handling".  How on earth did this manufacturer decide to use such materials with a device that is intended to be handled a lot, very possibly by children? ---  --- It's going back... --- 
I have dyed red hair, a lot of dyed red hair. this product made no noticable difference in the shine of my hair. WIll not purchase again
I subscribe to several woodworking magazines and have subscribed to Woodworkers Journal since 1990.  Each magazine has a character of it's own with a woodworking level reflected in the complexity of the projects it presents.  This magazine is a bit more complex than, say Wood magazine.  It should be understood that some style and esthetics are usually compromised when a project is simplified.  I have one of Woodworking Journal's projects in my living room.  It is perhaps the most beautiful piece I have ever made.  If you have become an advanced amature (sp?) this magazine will give you projects that you will take pride in making and showing to others
The seams on the pillow are sharp and uncomfortable.  The extra pouches that supposedly provide additional support don't measure up.  THe snaps that should hold the ends together don't work.  Basically, it would be OK if it came with a soft cover
This is Guido Sarduci from the Royal Tuscan Office of Copyrights and Internets and I must insist that you cease any and all sales of theese so called "Tuscan Whole Milks" immediately or I will have to come there and beat you up and then my mom came upstairs and saw me fighting and she got scared and said "You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air!" I whistled for a cab and when it came near, the license plate said "FRESH" and it had dice in the mirror. If anything I could said that this cab was rare, but I though "Nah, forget it. Yo home, to Bel Air!" I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8 and I said to the cabbie "Yo home, smell ya later!" Looked at my kindom, I was finally there, I could sit on my throne as the prince of Bel Air.   Love me sum Tuscan
The screen is too small. if you want to watch it in your car, you have to cover it because the back light is too week.
My wife bought these for me and I was just putting them on my morning Cheerios like a madman and I said, "Hey, these are good...where did you get 'em?"  ---  --- "Oh, from Amazon...can you believe they were only $17.00?" ---  --- Silence. ---  --- I just looked at her, "Are you nuckin' futs? Gimme those things. I'm going to put them into our safety deposit box with our bonds, our living trusts, and my favorite Hot Wheels..." ---  --- Blueberries are good for you and I would suggest to eat them on a regular basis, but the price for these things is simply absurd. Do I look like I'm wearing my shirt that says, "STUPID"? I don't think so. I'm sure you can get frozen blueberries for less and hey, fresh is always good, and if you can't get frozen or fresh, get a Hostess Blueberry Pie. Sure it's sugary and will feel like you've got a leadweight in your stomach after eating it but the pie is only .50 cents..these little blue suckers are $17.00. That's more than my whole wedding cost. ---  --- Just kidding. I'm not that cheap. Actually, I'm not cheap at all, but I do like money and I refuse to pay $17 for some humiliated looking berries... ---  ---  --- Geesh
I have not gotten to use this swing yet, but I just wanted to say that assembly was easy and after I had it all put together I played with the toys on the tray and it was the coolest thing ever:)  I highly recommend
It's a chunk of plastic with some bits of rubber attached.  Effectively serves its purpose, but for nearly 16 bucks?!!  Puleeeeeeeease
I've had my 1 quart Stanley Thermos for over 20 years now, and this is by far, no doubt about it, the best thermos ever invented. I have poured hot coffee in this thermos in the morning prior to doing field work in the dead of winter in upstate NY.  After leaving the thermos literally sitting in the snow in -20 degree temperatures all day, at 5 pm the coffee was still piping hot. ---  --- If you need to keep liquids hot, this is the best non-electric product out there for doing it
Erewhon Rice Twice Cereal is a very flavorful, crunchy gluten free cereal. --- I highly recommend it to anyone who is on a gluten free diet. 
This album is one of the best sonic youth album...I advise everyone to listen this album...Break the circle of common popular music...This album irritates your soul and freedback your dreams..
Just listening to the samples of this new remix of "GOLD:35th Anniversary Edition ~ The Carpenters" I found it to be in my opinion sadly remixed very badly. Certainly not a tribute to the excellent talent Of Karen Carpenter and Richard as well. I wonder what Richard was thinking when he remixed these songs? As another review noticed and I agree with, is the bass on some is so loud it almost drowns out the pure excellence of Karen's deep resounding truly perfect voice. This is not a CD you want to get if you really want to appreciate the true pure sound of The Carpenters. The older CDs (if still in production or if you can find them used) "Carpenters Classics 25th Anniversary" a 2 CD disc 98:04 minute Collection remastered digitally, is a much better pick. Especially for those who remember The Carpenters when Karen was still alive and the original arrangements were nothing to mess with. The other CD's worth finding of The Carpendters especially if you like the Talent of Karen's deep resounding perfect voice, would be The CD "Voice Of The Heart" This is a hautingly beautiful collection of Love songs by Karen who lets each song touch your Heart and Soul making you feel as if you were right there as she sings each song. The other one I would highly recommend, if Christmas is your Holiday, would be "Carpenters Christmas Portrait"... "Special Edition digital version....Celebrating 70 continuious minutes of the Seasons best..." with Karen and Richard. There are 34 Carpenters songs as timeless as their sound,and 11 performances heard on this Holiday CD for the first time. These CDs are all the songs you fell in love with the first time you heard Karen sing. These are the arrangements so beautifully done with her and Richard. This new remix maybe OK if you have not been familiar with how wonderful the original songs The Carpenter's recorded and later remastered-Not Remixed- sounded. For this reason I give this 35th Anniversary remix a 2 star rating. These older CDs are how The Carpenders really won over their fans, took the Music Industry by storm and gave a generation of Music lovers reason to Love The Carpenders music and the sound they gave each song. Talent that can still win over anyone who truly appreciates the timeless talents only The Carpenters could deliver. As I more or less said in my Title for this review and taken from an old saying "if it ain't broke don't fix it!" or in this case Don't Remix it! --- 
I was a big fan of the ST1. The plot and characters were excellent, it rated up there with the best of them I would give ST1 5 stars. I saw this was on sale for a great price so I got it expecting great things. Usually sequels aren't to par with the originals so I at least expeted a 3-star movie. When i flipped on the movie i said "WOW....right where they left off" at a pretty good battle seen with the BUGS. Well, that was it I was waiting for more action. I waited....I waited...I waited and I waited...they made the plot intersting with occasional nudity but it still wasn't worth it. I don't know who's idea it was for the sequel but I hope this was their last one. I'll stick with the new Battlestar Galactic and Star Trek reruns
Despite reading bad reviews, I took a chance and purchased this item.  I got the first one, hooked it up and it quit working within two hours.  Ordered a second, it quits working within the hour.  I should have known better as others have posted the same experience.  Great concept, maybe they will get the actual product correct in the next year.  Please don't waste your time on this one now....
My sister-in-law bought this product for me after I had admired the shade (Purr, a light baby pink color) that she was wearing. I have used other MAC products before with great results, but was VERY dissapointed with this product.  ---  --- First of all, I gave this product one star because the shade does look very pretty on the lips and went very well with my skin coloring. However, this product is sticky. VERY sticky! It does not matter whether you apply a lot or very little, you still wind up with this horrible heavy feeling on your lips. Not only is it sticky, but just down right uncomfortable. When I wear a lip gloss, I want to be soft and smooth feeling. I want to be able to rub my lips together without them getting stuck together and 'dragging' so to speak.  ---  --- Also, because of this gloss' consistancy, it has a tendency to clump together on your lips and form a line of 'gunk' on both the upper and lower lip where the two meet and rest together when you have your moth closed. This will start to happen only about 15 minnutes after application. Very embarassing when you have been talking to some hot guy and then look in the mirror afterwards to discover you have gross lines on your lips!!!!   ---  --- This product seems to be popular with other viewers, however, I would never reccomend this to anyone
I just purchased the Plusdeck2c PC Cassette Desk to convert my old cassettes to MP3 files for further transfer to CD's.  The unit works great abit trying to see the exact position of the tapes while in a fast forward or reverse mode leaves a lot to be desired.  It looses it's place and you have to do some guess work to find out where the tape is actualy at, but that is only a minor problem otherwise it works great.
I gave this monopod to my boyfriend, as a gift, and it's been perfect for his use.  He videotapes his kids's baseball and softball games, and was tired of holding the camcorder for so long.  He didn't want to deal with a bulky tripod when he was getting up and down, so a monopod seemed like a great idea.  He has LOVED it!!  He says it keeps the camera very steady and it's very easy to change the height so he can use it sitting or standing.  He's no professional, but he uses his camcorder a lot, and he'll be happily using the monopod for a long time
I recently wrote a review for this item due to a launching issue. Very angry, I made numerous calls and emails to Nova. At last I was able to converse with a rep who was more than helpful and made right with all my issues. I am pleased with my outcome with Nova and the response, making sure I was a satisfied customer.  I only rate this 4 stars as I am just now using the program and am very excited with what I've been able to accomplish in the past 3 days.  Thank you Nova for your help
I purchased this camera a year ago (summer 05).  Definitely a great upgrade over the original rebel, although the new xti has a larger screen which is the one aspect of this camera that is not perfect.  There are other sites that will perform more comprehensive reviews of this camera, but after a year mine is still working perfectly
The Xbox DVD Movie Playback Kit is very easy to set up and use. All you have to do is plug the little receiver into one of the controller ports, put in a DVD and enjoy. The buttons on the remote are responsive and easy to get used to. However, the Xbox DVD system is very simple. It doesn't have any eject buttons (something mentioned many times by other reviewers) and not as many options as more expensive stand-alone DVD players. You have to keep in mind that it was made for people who already have an Xbox and don't want to shell out an extra $50 for a DVD player that has a lot of special features when all they want is to be able to watch a movie. The DVD itself runs exactly as it would on a good stand-alone DVD player. It's sort of like one of those little $100 digital cameras. There isn't anything really special about them. They just take good pictures that you can put on your computer.
My HD-DVD also does not work on the 360 add on. I tried the press OK and everything else I could think of. This disk just freezes right after the production logo when it should be going to the menu. This is the only HD-DVD disk that I've had a problem with and I have about 10 of them. I didn't purchase the Chicago disk as I already have it and didn't think it was worth the HD purchase. I did purchase the Eagles HD-DVD and it is excellent. That one also has a trick to it. It defaults to a PCM stereo file so you have to triger it to the DTS ON mode and then it is amazing. I hope its true that microsoft is working on a patch for Heart. I saw them last year and they were fantastic. Not as good as the old days but neither am I. They still surprised me that they sounded sooo good. --- **** UPDATE**** Since Amazon doesn't have acceptible response. --- E-mail from distributor IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT received 2-13-07: --- Dear Dave --- Thank you for you inquiry.

I absolutely loved this game. I couldn't stay off my computer, it was addicting. The game was long but the puzzels and clues really get you thinking, It was very entertaining and I would recommend it to everyone who loves a mystery. I can't wait until the next one comes out
I absolutely love this movie!  It's one of my favorites and I could watch it over and over.  It's got good plot, good acting and great child stars. I'd recommend this movie to ANYONE to hasn't seen it yet (if there is any such person)
I'm not really a gadget guy, and what gadgets I do have get pretty beat up. When the company gave me a Blackberry so I can "stay in touch", I needed to at least take care of the thing. So, I bought this skin from Speck Products. Its is absolutely awesome! ---  --- No more dings or scratches. I'm a minimalist and for that, the Blackberry Skin is perfect! A cool look, not bulky. Easy access to the buttons. They did their homework on this product.  ---  --- A must have for anyone who owns a Blackberry. I also see they have these for the Treos
My daughter who is about to turn 4 loves this game.  She wants to play it constantly.  So it's good for their entertainment value but bad for yours. The dresses are hard to get on the dolls and they rip and tear very easily.  It takes as long to set the game up as it does to take it.  There are also some sketchy directions such as rolling the dice but not having to go as far as the die say but you can't go over that numbers i.e. you roll a 4 but you only want to go 3 spaces then that's allowed.  That's confusing when you're trying to teach your kids their numbers and how many spaces to go but otherwise you'd be rolling the dice forever trying to get to the one spot you're trying to reach
When I recieved this item, I had mixed emotions for the product. On one hand, the black finish looked very nice, and the clear plastic covering protected the screen but was still easy to read. Also, all of the side buttons are fairly easy to reach with average-sized fingers (except maybe the camera button), so navigating the phone with the cover still closed is pretty easy unless you need to use touch functions or open the QWERTY keyboard. --- However, due to the padding and the nature of the metal materials, the case is very thick and bulky - when using the belt clip, the phone sticks out far enough that it does not even rest evenly on your hip, but leans at an angle. ---  --- BUT, the deciding factor in my two-star rating is that this case was the cause of the only two times I have dropped my Cingular 8525 (which at such a steep price, is not something I like to drop). The problem lies with the snap-shut system that closes the case. Because the metal is so thin, it does not secure very well, and can come open pretty easily. To fix this, I simply bent the piece of metal downward and towards the phone, so that it was much harder to both open and close the case. This, for the most part, solves the problem, but it is still dangerous and caution is DEFINATELY in order. ---  --- My favorite thing about this case is that you can open the case and slide the keyboard open without actually taking the phone out of the case. This is nice because it enable quick replies to text messages. This is the only reason I did not give it a one-star rating.  ---  --- I am currently looking for a soft case, preferably a leather sleeve case that I can just pull my phone out of off of my hip, rather than bother with a clip anymore. ---  --- As a final warning - BE CAREFUL if you buy this case. Plus, I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point
This is a great desk top or night stand clock.  Projection to view time requires it to be dark, but it is great.  Projection requires the clock to be plugged in with the included adapter.  Batteries are used for backup and normal view. 
Try before you buy! This game has a major glitch: its save game files are erased sometimes, so you can start all over again. --- Beware
I have been very impressed with every Avent product that I have purchased.  I have found these pacifiers to be so nice.  They are completely clear and you are able to see smiles around them.  My baby LOVES hers.  We can't live without them
I love this book! I have read A-C so far, and this is my favorite book so far. It has a really strong plot, and a surprising ending. This crime book series is great, and I highly suggest picking this book up, or even starting with A
My daughter got this toy when she was 2 months old and she still loves it (at 8 months).  It was the only toy that would keep her entertained on car trips at first. ---  --- I took one star off due to some minor problems: 1) it is not machine washable (unless you don't mind loosing the barking sound) and 2) the battery can't be replaced.  
I know my gummi's and Haribo gummi's are the only ones worth eating! If I can't find this brand at the store, it's nothing. A little tip: I buy the 5lb. bag at Safeway for under $6! (A much better bargain than here.) They are usually located on the bottom shelf underneath the hanging smaller bags
Overall, I am satisfied.  So far I have not experienced creep, but I move my car into position very very slowly, so that may help. ---  --- My one suggestion is that it could be wider.  It is easy to slide by if I am just a little off line. ---  --- I have yet to try it on my boat trailer, so that will have to be covered later
I bought Version 5 of this software a few years ago and was very pleased with the many features.  A tech at my Isp (BellSouth) recommended this software to me. I recently purchased version 6 for my new laptop which is running Windows Xp Pro.  Installation was a snap.  Updates are frequent and install quickly with my Dsl connection.  The software suite has in my opinion more and better features than Norton Pro which I use on my desktop.  I really like the Registry cleaner (fixer) and the defrag tools.  (They use Trend Micro for virus protection) The program allows simple maintenance or for more experienced users indepth tools that allow you to maintain and tweak your system. There is a lot of extra programs that come with this software that I did not install after reading some reviews and warnings about using them.  However, my personal experience after installing just the System Suit 6 Professional has really been good for me. I bought my copy from Walmart and filled out the rebate following the instructions carefully and I received my rebate after about 6 weeks.  I hope if anyone buys this software because of my recommendation will have similar results.  I would rate my knowledge of computers as above average, which may be why I did not have any problems with the software.
This looked great when it came, but broke in only one day. REALLY poor craftmanship.
This is truly the best in highlighting products and I have tried many high end and cheaper products out there.  This is so light and just doesn't get all cakey and greasy.  I have tried so many brands that claim to look natural, but they just don't.  This really does and don't let the price fool you either.  It only takes alittle and lasts a long time, so well worth the price for the look it gives.  I love this!
I liked the watch. I had to send the first one back because the date would never change. I got the second one a month ago and haven't been able to wear it for the past two weeks because the band gave me a skin rash. Nice looking watch. Too bad I have to carry it around in my pocket now
My son (3) and I love these.  He likes to hop them around and kiss them before he eats them.  He likes all the Bunny Graham varieties (chocolate, honey, cinnamon); they taste like the traditional Graham crackers
The picture for this pendant is deceiving; it is a lot smaller than it appears.  I know the dimensions were given but the picture gives one the impression that it is bigger than it really is.  Nevertheless, my wife likes it very much and that's good enough for me.  The price was right at $18.00 so overall I think it was a good buy.
DO NOT PASS THIS ONE UP. BUY THIS AMAZING DVD AND YOUR EARS WILL BE SATISFIED..
I agree with some of the reviews about the rush and need to keep up with the happiness tied to immigrant status.  That being said - I spent endless hours researching and building and thoroughly enjoyed this game.  Well worth the cost and enjoyable.  I am not familiar with the other Civ games - and was looking more for a city building game set in the past, similar to my favorite game Children of the Nile - perhaps that explains why I was not disappointed
I bought the WMR968 2/10/2005 and as of today,2/14/2007, only the indoor Baro-Therm-hygro still works. The Anemometer was replaced under warrenty 11/2005. This service took 2 months to complete with Oregon Sci. The anemometer then quit 12/2006 and Oregon Sci. said tough luck it's out of warranty. The Thermo-Hygro quit 2/2007 and once again, tough luck. ---  ---  My thoughts on the unit besides it not functioning after 2 years: Cheap and cheaper. The manual is nearly worthless. The anemometer is accurate to about 60 Kts. then gets wildly optimistic. The temp.,humidity, baro seem accurate. The rain gauge is kinda funky the way it reports because of a delay built in and the resolution but it is useable. All of the failures I have had I think are related to water intrusion into the sending units. Everone has had green corrosion on the PC boards when taken down from the rooftop. The sealing of the units is very poor and the use of phone cords is very cheap.  ---  ---  I just got off the phone, again, with Oregon Sci. and Juan from customer Service told me "we can't help you".  ---  ---  If you want a weather station that is made cheaply, has no customer support and will last less then 2 years buy a WMR968. I guess for the price compared to professional weather stations this thing will attarct a lot of people but buyer beware
My trusty Seiko of 21 years gave out recently (I should really remember to take it off when doing strenuous labor) and I went in search of a similar style.  I received this replacement about a week ago and I love it already.  It's light-weight and easy to read in the light or dark
I looked at this camera the Panasonic hvx200, the sonys, the jvc 200, and even Canon's bigger brother the X1. I found this one to have fantastic reviews on DVinfo.net, a great video forum. My concerns about 24f vs 24p were addressed to my satisfaction- there really isn't a difference. I like tape vs the HVX's expensive storage solutions. One concern I had was, will it look like a pro camera? That is important in some situations where your equipment gives you added credibilty with clients and talent.  ---  --- As soon as I opened the box I was in love! This is a really substantial camera. Especially with the opt wide angle from Canon and the matte box provided, this does not look like your mama's camcorder. ---  --- I really like the manual controls, so that you don't have to go thru menus to change parameters. The layout of everything is great. I really like the dual on/off and zoom controls- top of handle plus rear right side. Holding the handle for low or medium height shots is very, very comfortable and the controls are perfectly positioned.  ---  --- Only down side- and it is incidental. The matte box is a bit flimsy- lightweight plastic. That helps with weight, but I worry about breaking it. Some may say that HDV codec is not as good as DVCpro, but my eye does not see it. The colors are magnificent and it blows away many other cams in low-light. ---  --- If you are looking for point and shoot, this is not your baby, but if you want a pro quality camera for a really great price- this is it
I wanted a bike to ride around on unpaved trails on my few acres in the country.  This retro designed, one speed, steel framed, coaster braked, comfort  bike seemed to be the ideal choice.  When it arrived, I pulled out the tool box and set to work assembling it.  The first frustration was that the instructions for assembling this bike are NOT included in the manual (which seems to cover every bike but this one). How hard could it be to write up instructions (with tool specifications)for EACH model they manufacture?  A one page flyer could have done the trick. To further complicate  matters, some of the models in the manual are assembled using metric tools and others call for standard sizes.   ---  --- It turned out that I couldn't complete the assembly, because I couldn't find a tool to handle the quick release hardware for the seat attachment.  I had to take the bike to a bike shop to complete the assembly.  Even the bike shop had problems with this bike, because there is so little clearance between the fenders and the tires.  I watched while they had to bend the sides of the back fender out by hand, so that it wouldn't rub the tire.   ---  --- When I got the bike home, the first thing that I did was to adjust the seat to the correct height, and take it out for a ride.  Within 10 seconds the seat slipped all the way down.  The quick release handle can't hold the seat in place with the weight of a rider on it (I'm not that heavy).  Chrysler should have taken the retro design a step farther on this, and drilled holes in the seat stem for a rod insert to adjust the seat height.   ---  --- Rather than try to dis- assemble this and box it up to return it...I will check to see if I can drill the seat stem myself to get the seat secured at a ridable height.  Its too bad they couldn't come up with a workable design for such an essential part of the bike as the seat height adjustment!  The points I do give here are for the otherwise sturdy frame, and tires that will work well for unpaved trails...when I can finally ride this. 
But just add a little Spenda and cream and it is mmm, mmm, good. I can actually feel a slight boost of energy and think more clearly on the days that I drink this tea. Also, I haven't had the slightest inkling of a cold or flu. This year has been an especially bad cold and flu season for this area and I have been exposed to all of it but, knock on wood, I've been the healthiest one in the family and at work (and the only one drinking this stuff). So go figure? There are too many things good about this tea to not try it
this is a very tasty brew, just right strength for your regular mug.  On the senseo just hit the two cup button and its just right
Don't bye thees. They don't look like orginals. They are really small, so it looks like glasses for children!! --- It's just waste of mone
I bought this for my wife for the holidays, it was a bit expensive for a candle but I believed that it would last a long time and burn uniformly. However, in our case, after about an hour the candle went out. The wick burned too quickly, becoming too small, and now the candle won't stay lit for more than a few minutes before it drowns in the wax. The return shipping will cost a lot, so we will just toss it out. Waste of money, don't buy one
This fanny pack is superb.  The design is very roomy: a very large main compartment fully lined and zippered, and two convenient smaller zippered compartments in the outside front of bag.  Also fairly large zippered area within the main compartment, and another on the back of the fanny pack leather area near your body.  As yet I haven't found a use for the very small side zippered pockets near the belt.  The leather is very good quality and the brown is a warm medium shade.  All zippers work well.  Extra large belt.  I am a new fanny pack wearer, so it does take some getting used to the  bulk and weight in the front waist area, but it beats the strain of shoulder straps, hand bags, etc.  I use the cell phone pocket for my hearing aid volume/program adjustment device, the size of a small cell phone. Similar fanny packs in leather stores in my town cost over $70 without all the features of this one.   It arrived soon after I ordered it. I recommend it highly.  You won't be disappointed. 
I would often rush to see all Arnold Schwarzenegger films, i adore his bad acting "it must be the muscles" i was 10 year old and he was the bomb now his movies now gives me a pain in my stomach and i start to twitch, i can't believe how terrible an actor this man was "IS"  and all the money he made doing these unrealistic bull crap, wow! talk about the American dream, i admit there are some of his movies i would have to rate a classic but however this one really sucks maybe it was the time,trend, maybe the era, but i have come a long way and this guy is a difinite no! no! for me, this movie had it's moments! for a 8 year old maybe! for an adult you have to have a strong stomach, you i would never say this about Bruce Willis mybe i am a hypocrite or maybe he just an good actor duh! i couldn't care less do with this what you will i won't recommend it later folks
I really like my earrings that I bought and they came in time
Ashley Judd's (Normal Life, The Locusts) husband, played by Jim Caviezel (The Passion Of The Christ, Frequency) gets arrested and put on the guilty bench for a slaughter in El Salvador a bunch of years ago. So, Judd hires the always superb Morgan Freeman (Unleashed, Million Dollar Baby) to help her out on the case and to find out the truth while she tries to get her husband out of imprisonment. Judd then has threats on her life after. The opening sequence pulls you in, the thrills are a mixed bag (car crash scene for example was good) and the outcome, well, I really saw coming anyway. Ashley Judd's thrid thriller but its her second one with a murderous manipulative husband(Double Jeopardy). Twisted and Kiss The Girls had a killer running after her or playing games with her noggin. Also starring Bruce Davison (X-Men, Dahmer), Amanda Peet (The Whole Nine Yards, The Whole Ten Yards) and Tom Bower (Die Hard 2
It starts out like Laura Bush's Rules for Driving, but skydives after the opening pages, in which the then 17-year-old Laura kills a young man with her car, who just coincidentally happens to be her boyfriend!   ---  --- My interest in the book sharply dove after that, as it appears that coincidental killing is the most appealing thing about Laura Bush
My boyfriend has this cologne and I love it!  It smells so good.  Even if he is wearing the deodorant and not the cologne, it smells as if he was.  It may be a little on the expensive side (not as expensive on amazon.com as Macy's or other department stores), but it's well worth it.  Just be sure to correctly select the item you want because the picture shown is of the cologne
Good Camera for the Money.. Picture quality excellent. Used camera on recent trio to Florida for Spring Training and colors superb.Still learning the fine points and capabilties of the product. Dealing through Amazon exceptional. Product arrived well within promised time frame. --- No doubt a Good Deal 
This puzzle is a lot of fun and my son loves it. The container is a toy for itself
These are hands down, the most awesome pillows, we have ever owned.  They were originally suggested by a chiropractor at $60 per pillow, however at the time, a "water bed pillow" for $60 just sounded silly.  What brought me back around to these pillows, was the year-long search that my wife and I had been on for the perfect pillows.  One of her beloved cats managed to destroy our previous and quite comfortable pillows, which subsequently caused us to get caught up in the frustrating search for the perfect pillow.  We spent a year, buying this pillow and that pillow, all to no avail.  Then one day I rolled the dice, and bought a pair of these pillows with the covers.  The covers actually make the dish.  These are the most comfortable pillows that I have ever slept on in my 42 years on this planet!!!  These pillows rate 10 stars!!!  Just follow the directions and enjoy the best nights sleep you have ever had.  I do not work for, nor own this company, although after using their product I wish I did!!!  Our pillows are about three months old so far, and holding up exceptionally well.  They recommend you change the water every six months or so, depending on what type of water you put in.  The pillow is about half to three quarters cushion, with the water being the bottom layer.  They seal tight and do not leak. There is no audible sound from the water in the pillow, as if you follow the directions, they will instruct you on how to expel excess air.  These pillows and of those Black & Decker scissors, have to be my two best finds for 2006!!
I've had this knife and their rainbow leak model for few years. All I wanted was a thin, small and light knife and I got it. The blade material is hard enough to stay sharp for a while, soft enough to easily sharpen but not brittle like a ceramic or carbon steel knife for example. I have had the vary tip break a couple times but it's because I was doing something foolish with it (like using it as a throwing knife *wink wink* ;) ). It's not the best, it's not the worst but can compete with ether, witch is the best in my opinion. Shortly after I bought it the speed safe spring broke, eehhh who cares it opens fine without. It's vary well made it can take all of my fat butts weight easily when laying sideways on a hard surface. It's vary thin profile is comfortable and I sometimes can't tell if I have it with me or not. It has what looks like brass or copper washers/bushings instead of cheap thin steel/plastic ones (means no binding up, even when in need of oil). The frame lock is far stronger than a line lock and best of all it deforms and wares much slower meaning my knife will stay ridged when opened for a long time. ---  --- My favorite thing about it is the fact you can position the clip henge up or down. I chose henge down so it's ready to open the second it comes out of my pocket. ---  --- If you want nice quality and availability for the price, kershaw is worth looking at
Rule number one if you're making a Stephen King movie, especially if it's a TV movie; make it scary or don't make it at all!  THE TOMMYKNOCKERS fails to do this miserably!  For most of the film, you're watching a lot of green light and a lot of silly inventions.  Granted, that's all in the book, but it written chillingly by King in a way only he can do it.  There are some exciting alien moments at the end, but by then it's too late.  You've just spent three hours watching a bad knock off of an X-FILES episode. ---  --- On the plus side, I had no problem watching the infamous Traci Lords act like like a total slut!  Bless her

Don`t waste your time and money on this compilation.  What a cheap shot to take the consumers money.  Read the very fine print, it does have a disclaimer but you really have to look for it.  Shame on the distributor!
This item came in the mail and my 4 year old son and I were very excited.  I guess we should have read the description more carefully because I wasn't expecting so many tiny little pieces.  We used ticky tack and began the tedious process of sticking the different sized stars and such all over his room.  We waited that night to see the glowing celestial extravaganza.  We kept the light on for some time to 'charge' the glow in the dark element then turned off the light.  What we found was nothing close to amazing.  The glow was fairly dim and only lasted for a very short period of time.  We even turned a blacklight on them and all that did was make them glow a little brighter but, again, the glow only lasted about 10 -15 minutes.  I ended up going back online and buying glow in the dark paint and a star shaped sponge.  We dabbed stars all over his ceiling.  These glowing stars last most of the night and our friends and family think his room is really cool
So many disbelievers out there! I feel so sorry for you: no magic left in your dull and predictable worlds? Of course this book is on the level. While my dog Ernestine does not build art pieces as such, she's a pretty good cook and a crack shot. So why not dog artists? The review of dog art is a little species-centric, however. Most of the dog artists I know use faecies or urine to construct art, or engage in performance pieces: "Rooting The Leg"; and "Licking The Balls" spring to mind. Dog culture can be appreciated by humans but is not the SAME as human cuture. So a little less chauvanism please Ms Mathison
These cherries are awesome, my whole family loves them. We lived in Germany for 3 years and to find a place state side to order these from is great we order alot of them beucase they sure go fast
I have had this phone for almost 2 years now. I have dropped it many times- still works.  In Dec 06 it went through the washing machine in my pants, I let it dry out for 1 day and guess what- IT WORKS.  I am still using it as it works perfectly - even the camera. ---  --- I used my sisters Razr phone this weekend and I hated it.  The redial feature was slow and the phone not comfortable.  I will be keeping my Samsung for as long as it lives
Ok It's so obviously obstructing the view of your license plate. I thought it would only blur it from the high distant angles of the cameras but it blurs it from almost every angle besides directly behind it (and even then the edges are blurry).  Check the laws in your local state. I'm pretty sure this thing is very illegal!!! I had to trash mine. Thanks for taking my money
We have had it on our patio for about 4 months and it works great, the numbers are clear enoungh to see from our pool area
One of the best bargains yet that we have purchased from Amazon
We needed a car top carrier for a drive from Arizona to Utah.  After much research, we decided to give the Kar Pak a try.  It worked wonderfully!  We fit two suitcases, a duffle bag, and some random stuff in garbage bags on top of our minivan.  During the drive, we weathered snow, sun, and rain.  We were on the road for a total of 13 hours.  By the time we reached our destination, everything inside the Kar Pak was dry and perfect. The Kar Pak itself was easily washed off, folded up in it's box, and put into storage.  This is a great option for someone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money on a car top carrier.  It's easy to install, doesn't budge (we checked the straps several times during the trip, they never loosened or anything), and it keeps everything inside dry if it rains or snows. 
First: The part that the ratcheting clip clips to has to be attached to the case with 4 screws.  Second:  No Fixed belt clip.  Third: Only the case is black, all other parts are clear plastic.  Bought 10 of them for 36 cents each, spent 35 dollars on shipping.  Guess i got what i paid for.  Now i have to go thru the process of trying to get a full refund
It's a cute little set - and I mean little.  Wayyyyy over-priced.  (...) Just didn't live up to expectations
At first glance, you'll think these are great - but the wimpy elastic combined with the slippery fabric makes for panties that are constantly sliding off your butt.
I love this sack.  And highly recommend it especially if your child likes to kick the blankets up over their heads.  Before I purchased this I found her sleeping with the coveres over her head twice!!!
I bought a pair of these, my wife tried them and liked them so much that she asked me to get a pair for her for Valentines Day (chocolates and flowers don't do it for her).  These headphones sound as good as my Bose for a fraction of the cost but give up a little in comfort (they do fit better with more use).  Do they really need that thick of a cord?
  I bought this dock from a seller called Miga.  They did an excellent job of answering my questions on the product and sending everything in mint condition.  I use the dock for my HP R817.  Having read the reviews regarding the insert I just went through HP's part site and ordered the correct insert for my camera.  It was only $5 (before shipping) and it arrived the same day as the dock package.  The dock transfers data so much faster then the cradle that comes with the camera plus it has an extra battery which would cost $50 and up by itself from HP.  I bought the dock for its dual charging ability for when I go on trips since this dock is less expensive then the fast charge travel kit.  I probably won't use the remote control feature or print images right from the dock.  But for what I will use it for its an excellent product for the price and I highly recommend it for you 817 818 users out there. 
He loves the Dog. I has very happy to find him. Since Toy Story was out 10 years ago I did not thing i would ever find  Slink my Grandsons favorite
I have rated this a 1 star because I have yet to receive the product that I ordered in November.                       ---  ---                                  B.R. from St Louis ---  ---                                         ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---                     
We are teaching my 6YO to ride a bike, but it's not going well.  He wanted a scooter, so I got him the Razor A2 and ordered the Razor Pro for me.  Very nice!  Supports my weight, is easy to maneuver, and is inexpensive!  The only problem is folding it up again when we're done - this is sometimes a bit tricky
The lotion does not get very warm and only the lotion in the uppermost part of the dispenser gets warm.  So if you want to use a lot of lotion, you have to wait in between while the lotion warms up.  I have dry skin so I put lotion all over.  Its more of an inconvenience to have to wait for each application to warm up and even when it does warm up, it isn't super warm. 
I bought this Barbie after seeing two pictures of angel Barbies on the website and reading the Manufacturer's Description. One picture seems to have been deleted now. The Manufacturer's description is of an angel with a dark blue dress and a long gold sash. I trusted that the Manufacturer's description, which matched one of the pictures, was the correct angel. The doll with the light blue dress is not impressive at all. It is very simple with vinyl wings. Be aware of which you are purchasing, the description is deceptive and incorrect
I use this for hand-tossed pizzas and it works quite well. It takes about 11 minutes to cook in a grill that has been pre-heated about 15 minutes. The pizza cooks evenly and the crust is perfectly done. My only gripe is that I wish you could get a bigger pan so that one could cook a larger (14-17") pizza.
These are the best memory cards you can get for the PS2.  Only get this one or the Sony PlayStation 2 1PK Memory Card.  Rumors spread that non-Sony memory cards can damage your PS2 and lose saves on you memory cards
I cannot believe they put this on the market.  Once it gets wet, there isn't much you can do about wringing it out.  It's title is true - it is a water magnet.  The problem is it just won't let the water go.  This towel is horrible.  I suggest using the 3-pack microfiber Meguiar's towels sold by Amazon as well under the subject "Meguiar's X2020 Supreme Shine Microfiber - Pack of 3"
I found this product to represent extremely poor value for money.  I purchased the product based on all the marketing hype and testimonials.  However, I have since come to the conclusion that these guys must pay people to write positive testimonials. ---  --- This product only covers the basics (levels 1 & 2).  Then they try to rope you into paying even more money for their intermediate levels. ---  --- I have since purchased a cheaper 'Tell Me More' package (for Spanish) and have been highly impressed with the scope of it.  They have packed so much more value into their package.  And it is a complete package - all the way to advanced level. ---  --- I think it's really disgusting that Rosetta Stone get away with selling such a seriously inferior product at such a highly inflated price and people still buy it.  I think it borders on being a scam
I LOVE these cups and better yet so does my baby!  They are easy for her to hold and the soft tip makes it easy for her to drink.  She has no idea that it's not a bottle.  It has made the transition away from the bottle so much easier.  Thank you
I bought this battery as a replacement for an old Canon BP511A.  It lasted about a couple of months before it started not taking a charge.  Complete waste of money
Lame! Lame! Lame! Corny sexual humour. No wonder it tanked- if the Amazon.com thing is true. Because it's bad. Don't watch it unless you think e*ections are one of the funniest things in the whole entire world
I could not get this mirror to angle properly in our Honda CR-V to give a view of the baby, and when my wife held the mirror on the seat as a test, the image of the baby was so small that I could discern no details about what the baby was doing. The mirror is also distorting. The image only appears focused and in the appropriate dimensions if you look DIRECTLY into the center of the mirror.
I've never been a big fan of dried fruit -- good for you or not, they are just too sweet for me.  But these montmorency cherries are wonderful.  It's the right mix of sweetness with tartness.  I LOVE to eat these straight out of the bag. 
I was a little reluctant to purchase these because I had heard a lot of things about the spring mechanism in them being faulty but that they were being recalled and fixed.  So I was wondering if the one I bought was a fixed model or not.  Well, it must have the newer design because I've been using these for a few months and I have nothing but good things to say about them.  I was previously using a long OXO set of tongs which were pretty good but a little flimsy for some of the heftier cuts of meat like, whole chickens and pork shoulders.  These tongs are sturdy!  You know that the minute you pick them up and feel the weight to them.  They can easily pick up anything you need on the grill and, because of the 20 inch length, you can keep you hand at a safe distance from the actual fire.  The handle has grooves for your fingers and thumbs which enhances the grip and they lock in a closed position for storage. --- If you do any outdoor cooking, you will appreciate these tongs.  They're a well thought out piece of equipment you'll use for years and be glad you purchased
55cm is for people as tall as 5ft-5". So this works great for my wife but not for me. She is pregnant and so safety was my number one criteria for selecting this. This is an amazing anti-burst ball.
I have mixed feelings about Philosophy products.  For one thing they have really done a number on my skin as far as drying certain areas of my skin out.  On the other hand, I use to have a very congested skin and nose area but I have noticed a HUGE difference in the congestion of my skin when using When Hope is NOt enough serum.  I haven't noticed any lifting but the line between my eyebrows has softened.  As far as reducing facial hair growth don't count on it.  I am only giving this 4 stars because even though it has helped keep my congestion under control, it hasn't done much more than that and I think it is a bit pricy for being just an exfoliator
Contrary to what the box and description here says this disc has NO subtitles or closed captions or whatever. The R2 neither. ---  --- So again, don't feel sorry for the film companies about their complaining of copying of films and stuff. ---  --- Non anamorphic or simply 4:3 format, no subs, not available at all (yes I mean you, Disney)... In short, no quality or consistency. Go and take a hike. ---  --- Stop lobbying for legislation and start making real DVD's
Its  just realy sad that hip-hop dont sound like  hard to earn anymore... Gang starr still gets daily airplay on my stereo and im glad i support these guys
We Love it! Best purchase I have made in a long time! At first I thought it was a little too much to spend on a metal detector...  This is in the middle range and very easy to use. I bought it as a family project, something we all could do. In the first 3 months of purchasing it we have found 3 diamond rings, 2 gold watches, a bracelet, gold necklace and several old and valuable coins that date back to as early as 1890. Also it's a great hobbie and money maker. Worth every cent!! Don't forget to get the headphones---a MUST!!! Get it for a Christmas 2004 gift, your gift will keep them busy and keep giving back all year long
I was assigned this book for a college course and was greatly surprised at its quality.  Blamires had C.S. Lewis as a tutor, and I've read some of Lewis's writings and have found them to be above average but not particularly special (many people do find his works special of course).  Blamires, on the other hand, I find to be very unique - his book is top quality and very helpful.  I'm surprised this isn't a very popular book, as it ought to be. ---  --- I have only two complaints, both of which are purely stylistic.  First, the edition I have looks like it's a copy of an earlier edition, which makes the text hard to read (I got used to it after a while though).  Some publisher should take it upon themself to retype this book and republish it.  My second criticism is something that can't be avoided - the book was originally written in the early sixties, so a lot of the examples are dated (i.e. references to WWII, which was still in memory, also out-of-date terms like "jive", etc.).  However, just a few of the examples are affected by this.  The book as a whole could be reasonably passed off today as a recent work, since so much Blamires's criticism of the Christian mind (or lack thereof) still (sadly) applies. ---  --- However, the Christian mind today is being rediscovered, and the march of atheism is on the decline, with the march of religion in general on the rise.  Even though things are looking up, Christians should keep Blamires's book in mind - not to get too comfortable with this (secular) world, for our real home is beyond bodily death.  That we ought to have a supernatural orientation is basically the theme and summary of this book. ---  --- Superb book, and I really recommend this to anyone.  This is definitely recommended for Christians, and also for any non-Christian who are curious and want to take a look at some of the problems Christians have today
Hey, angry young man! If you're going to just sit there all smug, Mr. "Yeah, I used to have a TV, but I busted it cuz I just don't care, doggie," and make fun of this nation's fine Secret Service, why don't you just go to an axis of evil nation and see how funny it is then? When you're sucking on rocks to stave off the inevitable side effects of dehydration. When, if you want to go to the market to buy more rocks to suck on, you have to whip yourself with metal shards tied to the end of long leather straps as you walk. And just because you saved the sorry excuse for a young lady who will become a drug addict bag lady once she gets old enough to lose hope of realizing her dreams earns you no points in my book. Freedom doesn't come for free, so quit whining about the draft, Dick Trickle! The "Moonlighting" tie-in is cute, but quickly turns sour, as Bruce Willis seems to have been off working on another "Die Hard" installment while the episode was being filmed and it's just not the same without those sarcastic wing-dingers. Bet you didn't know Lou Ferrigno was Scorsese's first choice for the lead, but he wasn't willing to thin down for the role and he kept firing his language coaches
Our son wanted a drum set for his 15th birthday.  Seeings he is totally new to this we didn't want to pay a huge sum for a set only to have him lose interest.  This set is great for beginners and he's very happy with it. ---  --- To people considering purchasing this, please note that the cymbals ARE NOT included with this set even though they are in the picture.  Perhaps the company should consider posting another photos sans the cymbals
I used Veganese for quite awhile, quite happily.  As there is no artificial fragrance, or strong natural fragrance oils in the product, it has a ho-hum scent.  This actaully was a nice break from all the overwhelmingly perfumed hair products on the market.  I felt Veganese adequately conditioned my hair, did not irritate my scalp.  I liked that it had no animal products and is not tested on animals.  Those who try to avoid chemicals may not like sodium lauryl sulfate in this product
I've lived in Oregon, Colorado and now the Northeast, and seen my fair share of snow. I got one of these from a friend two winters ago, and it's the best tool for snow removal I've used. I still have my ice scraper, since this won't remove ice, but it did wonders for those overnight dumps of 18-24 inches that we got in the northeast last year. I'm buying one for some Florida friends who will be experiencing winter for the first time in the northeast this year
i was so happy to recieve this movie,its very rarely shown on tv,i own my own thanks to amazon. the music in this movie is magnificent it's something to treasure for a life time .glen miller was a great composer ,one of my favorites is moonlight serenade ,they just cant make music like this any more ,this is a great movie to add to your collection. thank you amazo
I have tried many brands of chocolate covered toffee and I have to say Virgina Diner English Chocolate Covered Toffee is one of the best!  It is very fresh and it melts in your mouth. 
I must agree with the comments made by other reviewers.  This album is great.  Nancy Wilson's voice on this album is unlike anything I have ever heard.  You can't honestly say you're a fan of jazz if you don't own this
....and secured their musical legacy.  The Real Thing was a solid rock/rap mixture with newly hired Mike Patton providing vocals.  On Angel Dust, Patton had a lot more creative input, providing his wonderful vocal stylings and schizophrenic persona to Faith No More.  It's a joyous ride that after a less than stellar performance initially, has become something of a cult classic and favorite among many newer acts - and with good reason.  This album is all over the board.  Land of Sunshine reads like a list of fortune cookies (which is the supposed inspiration), while Caffeine is an anthem for Patton's drug of choice, and one of FNM's most energetic recordings.  Then there is the occaisonal oddball track showing Patton's range and sense of fun, like RV, which is like a melancholic rant from the stereotypical figure you might find living in an RV.  Not exactly bilboard material, but fun. ---  --- Adding to the record were the internal tensions of the band.  Jim Martin was having creative differences, yet pumps out some of his best work here.  Tensions may have fueld a more agressive record, and FNM would never sound better than they do on this album.  It's the bands chemistry - both good and bad - that make this album work.  Commercially, this might have not been the hit the record company wanted, but its legacy can still be heard today and it's still a great record to crank up for a drive, barely showing its 15 year old age
These shoes are beautiful and comfortable.  I wore them at a New Year's Eve wedding... danced all night with NO sore feet!  This is my third pair of Carlos shoes, LOVE THEM
WHITE RABBIT is one of the most famous brands of Guan Sheng Yuan (Group) Co.,ltd.and belongs to candy product. This product is very larruping that the candy's surface swathe a very very thin velamen made from sticky rice and it can eat.People always are interesting in the sticky rice velamen.This product's sales volume is very hot in USA(Kmart,Walgmart)
These earrings are great. They are the perfect size. I would recommend these to anyone who likes a classic look.
I'm a cologne junkie, and of my vast collection, Armani Mania is clearly my #1.  I'm into my 3rd bottle of this potion, and it continues to bring on the compliments, and inquiries of "What's that cologne you're wearing, it smells fantastic!"  You cannot - repeat - CANNOT go wrong here.  A modern classic
this is a great wallet! it fits into small purses. the purpose of this is just to hold a few cards, your id and a small zipper section for some money. it's not meant to be a complete, big wallet. i love it because it fits into my small purses and so easy to carry around. i don't have to shove and push my bigger wallets into my purse and not have room for anything else anymore. love it!
I just bought this yesterday, and though the product description here on Amazon says it's compatible with Windows 98 and Windows ME, the packaging says "TaxCut USB Drive is compatible with Windows 2000 and Windows XP."  All our taxes for several years have been done on a Windows ME computer with a USB port.  Now what?  HELP!
I was expecting the nero 6 ultimate all in one instead I received nero OEM Suite. The MPEG 4 encoder they claim is not included instead there is a thirty day trial. Better business bureau should be notified
I got so many compliments on these shoes the first time I wore them to work. They are very pretty and preppy looking. I wore them with slacks and a matching cable knit sweater. The green is very bright, so they don't match everything, but it's a standout accessory. Wore them without socks and had no blisters
IMPOSSIBLE TO RATE PRODUCT AS AMAZON SHIPPED BRAKE CLEANER INSTEAD OF POLISH. RETURN OF INEXPENSIVE ITEMS NOT WORTH THE TIME IT TAKES.  CONSIDER NOT USING AMAZON FOR SMALL PURCHASES UNTIL RETURN SYSTEM IS UPGRADED
its cute but it blocks barely any light. lace strap is itchy and uncomfortable.
I bought these because I normally can't wear a shoe without my orthodic insert. These are great. Very comfortable. I plan on living in them this summer. --- I bought a size 8 croc which was fine. These were on the big size so I exchanged them for the next smaller size. I guess I am a 7 and 1/2 so if you are inbetween sizes, go smaller with the Athens Croc
This was not exactly what I was expecting.  I thought it would be more like what I call "Vietnamese Sesame Balls."  Yet they were pretty good despite my mistake. --- 
Ordering online and not being able to try on clothing can be risky but it paid off with this purchase. I just wish it wasn't "hand wash only".
This is an adorable guitar and it's the perfect size for my two year old  but it's made cheaply.  The strings loosen after he strums it for a couple of  minutes which means I'm retightening the strings each time he plays with it. I  guess you get what you pay for (afterall, it  was only $14.99)! 
Quick shipping - I received this bike in 4 days (using free super saver shipping) and it was even over a holiday!  The bike comes in one large box with MANY pieces.  My husband and father put the bike together in less than 1 hour.  It looked a little overwhelming at first but was quite easy to assemble.  The bike is very compact and easily placed in small areas.  It is also very quiet - you have to listen closely to even hear the bike. ---  --- The resistance goes from 1 to 8 (one being the easiest to eight being the hardest).  My husband is an avid road biker and 8 could be too easy for someone looking for a really hard ride (like riding the equivalent of up-hill). ---  --- The bike offers basic functions that are displayed very large.  The display is easily toggled through.  The heart rate monitor picks up okay, but don't buy the bike based off of that function because it's not totally reliable. ---  --- All in all, a great buy!  I injured my back and was looking for a workout that would be good on my back.  The seat is uncomfortable (and I am petite- I would imagine it would be very uncomfortable if someone was larger.  But for the price, you can't beat it
I bought this tea because my job was stressing me out and causing a lot of anxiety, indigestion, etc. and I use and love the other flavors of Yogi tea.  Unfortunately, I can't handle the taste of this one.  It's just too strong - almost burns your tongue because it is so spicy.  I normally like ginger but this is too much
An ex-officer in the Argentinean military confesses how political prisoners were murdered. I can't write "highly recommended" about this book, because it seems to trivialise those horrible events to some marchendising event. Just read it, you may not be able to sleep for few nights, but you'll get a true look into the mirror of evil regimes, supported by the United States only because they were "anti-communist"
I bought this audio CD set at the Borders store, without the opportunity to preview the narration. Had I been able to do so, I probably never would have purchased it, let alone paid full bookstore price for it. But I needed an audiobook for my long drive the next day, so I relented.  ---  --- Lesson learned. ---  --- The audio quality is very insonsistent, at at times very poor, having been transcribed from the original audiotape recording.  ---  --- While the author is obviously greatly informed on the historical and geopolitical details of the Middle East, it does read very much like a history text. With the amount of detail presented, and the wide scope of coverage from one end of Europe reaching into the former Soviet states and beyond, one immediately feels the need for visual aids (maps, timelines, etc.) as guidance.  ---  --- The reader's narration is monotononous, with a very constant cadence which dulls the senses. Each sentence sounds the same as the last. This has the unfortunate effect of rendering each piece of information presented as no more significant than any other, and so all of the events seem to be lost to obscurity. After a while, the narration becomes little more than background noise. No information is retained by the listener
Wow! This is an excellent deck that lets you automatically get the Harpie Lady Cards, and as well as a monster card based on one of the characters from Legend Of The Mystical Ninja
Easy to use.  My car frequently has the CEL for engine misfires.  I took it to the dealer and they said as long as it's running OK, don't worry about it.  Now when it happens, I can clear the light myself, for free
I was expecting just to save the touch-screen from scratches, but these screens make the touch-screen also "feel" better. ---  --- There was no loss of brightness with the screen. ---  --- Placing the screen was a bit tough since clearning the surface perfectly is very tough. ---  --- Its a pack of 15 screens.  Have been using just the first one for the past three months, and see no need to replace it at least for another three months if at all I'll need to replace it
I am proud of the fact that I hold two degrees like many women. Do I work? No. I have chosen a different path. I have no children, married later in life, and gave up a wonderful job of two decades to care for my ill husband. Do I feel that I have no confidence nor respect? No. --- And from whom or what is this respect supposed to come from?   --- Caring for your family has nothing to do with any of this. I admire women who stay home to care for their families. When you have love, who gives a hoot what anyone else thinks. Personally, I find this book a little depressing, and I won't read it
I wanted to convert an HP LaserJet 4 Plus to a networked printer. Even though instructions from the manual was followed, the printer did not work. The customer support is claimed to be 24/7, but no one has closed my help desk ticket yet. This product cost more than a linksys router. So customers can naturally expect better customer service and better response time
We are always thrilled with the quality of Stella D'Oro cookies. They do indeed deserve the "gold star." These are shortcake cookies, very rich, with a fudge center. They are quite sweet and great for a tea table or served with a cup of strong espresso. This is the kind of cookie to pull out for top-notch guests and for dainty occasions like neighbors over for coffee, tea parties and after dinner sweets
My 14 month old son loves the Baby Einstein series.  They've been the only movies to hold his attention.  The sounds and music get his attention, the shapes and colors hold it. ---  --- That said, this movie never got or held his attention.  There are no interesting sounds or music.  The voices are very monotone.  While I understand the intention of this video, if you don't catch the attention of the child, what's the worth in it?  The pictures on the screen do not corrolate well with what is being said.  I also believe that there is value in learning not only foreign languages, but foreign cultures.  If I knew what was being said when nursery rhymes or poems are recited, I could repeat them in english as an additional learning tool.  All around, this move was disappointing
THE BEST BINOCULARS I HAVE OWNED,AND I HAVE HAD MANY. EXCELLENT CLARITY,GREAT FIELD OF VIEW TOO. NICE SIZE ALSO NOT TO BIG, NOT TO SMALL. YOU CANT GO WRONG WITH THIS FINE SET,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
 --- You can tell a lot about the readership a men's magazine is trying to reach by scanning the first three car ads. In the issue in front of me, they flog the Lincoln MKZ, Range Rover Sport, and Audi A6. ---  --- There you have it. We're going for the affluent but not super-rich young guy who won't even become aware that the Lincoln Town Car and Audi A8 exist until he turns 55.  Well, 52 maybe. ---  --- But you didn't need the cars to figure out MEN'S HEALTH. ---  --- It's about what all men think about and what affluent guys with six-pack abs (in reality or in their dreams) can generally snag: expensive suits, beautiful women who seem never not to pout, and beefy arms to set off those abs. ---  --- To be fair, there is actually a fair amount of *health* under discussion in these pages. But I doubt that's the main reason guys pull this magazine off the shelf instead of, say, DOG FANCIERS. ---  --- In spite of an irritating habit of treating women as trophies to be won or dupes to be lured, there is a good bit of wit in here about what one might call the manly dilemma in the modern world. And if it really is lack of *just* the right workout regimen that has kept you from getting all that's on offer in MEN'S WORLD, where there's at least one new workout each month that will cure all that ails you. ---  --- Don't mistake this monthly for serious journalism. But you won't need a brown paper bag to carry it out of the store either. ---  --- I kind of like it
I am so happy to have found this coffee.  --- This dark roast is rich in flavor. --- A great cup of coffee brightens my day every day
This is one of the nicest electric shavers that I've owned and the first wet-type shaver. I have previously owned Norelcos for over a decade. The original Norelcos (made in Holland) were fine but the recent ones have pathetic quality and they literally pull hair! It is painful! I eventually gave up trying to use my replacement lift-and-cut Norelco and decided to try out a high end model that cost close to two hundred dollars. Bad idea - you don't always get what you pay for! I was not quite happy with that either and after a two year haitus with disposable Gillettes, decided to try a wet shaver. I took my chance on this one, based solely on the reviews here. This is the very first "wet" shaver I've used and absolutely love it. It gives a close enough shave but not too close. You can use it with whatever shaving cream you use.  ---  --- Note that the Panasonic manual encourages using the cheapest foam type (not gel), Barbasol like stuff with this shaver. It also comes with a basic carrying pouch and the cleaning is as easy as it can get (just wash the thing under tap water). They really meant that this unit is washable. It is recharagable, lasts seven days on a charge, and costs less than replacement blades for competing brands. The build quality is excellent. The charger is a very clever design that gets the shaver completely off your counter space. You cannot go wrong with this. Amazon has a great value here. Sometimes you get more than you asked for and this is one of those rare things. Highly recommended. 
Would love to order these, but sizes are not clear.  Does small fit a toddler, is small a size 7?  Not sure how to order.
Very nice Gunpowder Green Tea.  Gunpowder Green is fairly dark when brewed and has a robust flavor.  My favorite of the green teas.  Timothy's is quite flavorful and works well in the keurig
This product is an absolute piece of junk. Do not buy this product. Will not even load properly onto computer. Have wasted several hours trying to install product on windows XP platform with no success. I have wasted a whole day trying to install this piece of junk on my computer, now I will probably waste another day trying to return this bunch of garbage to the vendor.
I had this camera for 2 months. It was kept in a case and was very well taken care of. I would not even allow my husband to touch it. I was taking pictures and then one suddenly came out as a white screen. I took another and the same thing. I asked my husband what he thought was wrong. We took out our memory card and tried internal. Same thing again. He said maybe it was the LCD screen. We loaded the pictures in the computer and it was even worse. I contacted Kodak several times. They don't care about their customers. I have talked to several others in similar situations with similar results. We will try to get their attention with a lawsuit. If interested contact me [...
While I realize that the majority of people thought this to be a stellar book, it reminds me of the story, "The Emperor has no clothes".  Yes, Choan can write a beautiful sentence and yes, the first several pages were intriguing but the switching of years was very annoying.  The "flipping back and forth" was not accomplished in a smooth, flowing manner.  In addition, the subject matter was incredibly depressing and the characters were so flawed that one did not even care about how their lives evolved.  The kidnapping was predictable and the ending contrived.  It would be impossible to recommend this book to anyone
I got my DVD a few weeks back and discovered I could not read any of the files form the 1990s. I tried on several computers I have in the house and came to realize that the DVD is defective. I contacted Gitcorp about the problem and they informed me they would send me a replacement disc.  ---  --- Problem is that after nearly four weeks there hasn't been any DVD and repeated attempts to contact Gitcorp has resulted in no reponses. ---  --- Update, after continued emails to Gitcorp, I finally got a replacment DVD. They didn't even ask to see the original bad DVD. So my rating of this product would go up if I could. If you buy the product, check it closely, and get in touch with Gitcorp as soon as you find any problems. They can be very slow about responding
Great magazine couldn't recommend it any higher for anyone starting out with macs. iCreate also introduced a great Pro section in 2005 to delveinto the workings of ProApps such as Final Cut Pro, Photoshop, mDVD Studio Pro etc. Now here's the thing, I'm wondering how the magazine can be available for subscription while the magazine was put on hold late last year. Me, or anyone I know with a subscription haven't recieved the mag for months, and there has been no contact from the people who handle the  subscription despite zillions of e-mails. So be careful, get the full story before you hand over any money!!!!!!!!!!!  check the web for similar storries, you will find the
The shoes are not exactly what I wanted bacause I was trying to get the same shoe that I had purchased some years ago. Times change and so does style. I searched everywhere and these were the closest to what I wanted. The Keds shoes from Amazon which I ordered and received on time might I add, were more like what we used to call Bo Bos and the rhyme used to go like this..... "Bo Bos they make your feet feel fine, Bo Bos they cost a dollar 99, Bo Bos." Don't know who made it up even but that was the rhyme we used to sing. I can't explain exactly how the older pair is but there is a slight look and feel of a difference. I still like the older ones better. Not sure if I'll ever find the same ones again. Oh and one last thing, if I could give shoe and clothing stores one tip, it would be to make adult sizes for the children's items. They make some really cool things for kids today. Like the Keds Girls' Jazzy Sneaker. Hope it's not just because I haven't grown up yet
A great shoe! I was very impressed with the softeness of the leather, immediate comfort and versatility of this shoe. This is definitely a well made, year 'round slide. If you are looking for a classic loafer; this is your shoe.
Two main problems with this "cordless massager". The first being that it doesn't hold a charge for very long. You may get an hour use on a full charge, and that shows diminishing power as it goes. Add to that it's general lack of any real massaging capability and you have one very poor piece of equipment. If you're looking for something to rumble a slight bit, this is for you. Otherwise, save your money
I don't have a review, I have a question.  As a grandparent of a 10 year old blind girl.  Is it possible that someone could send me directions for  this game?  I would like to get it printed in braille for her.  Thanks for  your help..Judi Ree
I love Peterson's Guides, but the birds of Mexico is severely lacking.  The art certainly holds up to the standard set by the guides to North America, but unfortunately, it can only be considered complete if you tag along two other Peterson Guides.  Perhaps a good addition if you wish to complete your collection of Peterson Guides, but otherwise, buy Howell's or Edward's Guides, both of which far outshine this guide when considered alone.  Howell's is certainly the most complete, but Edward's guide is a bit handier in the field
This is the type of story that scares me: where seemingly innocuous decisions propel characters toward a devastating fate.  The characters, portrayed by Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale, are going to be friends for life even if they slowly, eventually drift apart.  For a final trip together they decide not to go the safe, routine route of going to Hawaii, again, and want something different, perhaps a little adventurous, so they decide on Thailand.  While there they meet a charismatic, only slightly mysterious man on their trip and are both immediately enamored with him; and the jealousy starts to seep in.  In the midst of this subtle, female power struggle they are both conned and subsequently accused of smuggling narcotics and sent to jail. One poor decision after another and they are spinning helplessly down the drain.  It's always the more realistic tales of decent people caught up and tossed about by circumstance that are more frightening to me than the Hollywood horror-fests with aliens and gore.  There are many intense scenes throughout this film that had me caring about the principle actors and how were they ever going to get out of this horrible and unfair situation.  Claire Danes deserves top billing as she plays an average girl trapped in an unthinkable scenario, whereas everyone watching can relate to her emotional state at any given time.  She is truly a talent.  Kate Beckinsale nearly reaches the same level of intensity playing the all-American daddy's girl caught up in the chaos.  For that matter, when the two leads are playing off one another the chemistry is equally excellent.  Bill Pullman makes his presence felt with a conscience-stricken, kind-hearted turn as their lawyer.  There are even a handful of supporting characters that are memorable which makes this a veritable feast of character actors.  This is a movie worth watching over and again, and it is easy to recommend
this is the 2nd SE phone after T637, and this phone is just better --- using it with T-Mobile, it works pretty well as phone and modem --- voice: the strongest part, the best sounding phone I ever used in 6 years, the speakerphone is OK, not so loud --- reception: another strongest part, with T-Mobile, it can get some weak signal when all other don't get signal at all; however, the antenna is located at the top back (where the loop is), touching this part will lose reception --- operation: typical SE style, pretty easy for SE users, 3 dedicated buttons: web, messaging, task --- cam: excellent, even though it doesn't have auto-focus like K750 and K790, it looks pretty good, even it's better than nokia 6270 --- bt: very easy to use and pair, with pc suite installed, file transfer and sync is just a piece of cake, the transfer speed is 300-400kB, this is the maximum of bt 2.0 speed --- screen: the main screen is pretty bright, even I have to set the brightness down, animated standby screen is simply cool; external screen, however, is monochrome (it maybe a plus when using outdoors, the main is barely viewable under sunlight), it display info only, it's a kinda inconveient when doing self-pic --- audio player: I seldom use it because it doesn't support ogg vorbis, which I mainly use, streaming audio supports real only, no shoutcast --- conclusion: this phone is a pretty good phone for the price, quad-band is a must for Cingular users, fast EDGE modem for web and tethering --- score: I give it 95/100, there're some cons --- rare memory card (M2), and it's not hot-pluggable --- lack of ogg vorbis and shoutcast support --- no default USB mode (always asks when plug in, kinda annoying
I showed this to my 6th grade English class, while we were reading Miracle Worker to give them a glimpse into contemporary deaf culture. They loved it, and really learned a lot about cochlear implants. I highly recommend it for teachers who are interested in giving students a broaded understanding of deaf culture and also something that will really spark classroom debate and interest
I have always used Norton products, and upgraded to IS 2007 when my --- subscription came up for renewal. WHAT A MISTAKE. My computer --- freezes up all the time, and the software is difficult to use- it is --- not at all straightforward like previous versions of Internet Security. --- Do not buy this product.
 This was exactly what my husband had admired in Macy's.  I paid $25 more for the convenience of having it delivered to my home without my husband's knowledge.  He is thrilled with the jacket
My son love these shoes, I have to stop him from wearing them so much, I just wish they came in other colour
My son is [...] and aside from getting too big for his crib, my sister is having a baby and needs it. I was a bit concerned about making the transition for my son due to his "crib attachment," but this bed made it easy as pie. It's adorable, sturdy and fun. My little boy slept all night in his big boy bed from the very first night and we've never had a problem (we've had it for a month). He loves to drive his match box cars up and down the tracks and stand on the toy box saying "choo choo." It's just been great....I'm so glad we spent the money
 I needed a sub for my garage, and did not want to spend more than $200. Got it on sale for well under that. ---  ---  Since this was just for the garage, when tinkering with my bikes, I didn't want something too expensive, and didn't expect much from such a small sub. I was very pleasantly suprised by it's performance, This thing will rock when needed, and hits suprisingly low for a small sub in a very large space.  ---  ---  I first tried a Polk PSW10, since Polk products had never dissapointed me in the past. Well there is always a first time... The Yamaha smokes the Polk sub, I returned the Polk immediatly.  ---  ---  Of couse it doesn't compare with the Energy S12.3 I use in my main music system, but for 1/5 the cost, I never expected it to
Steven Seagal keeps making films. In 2005 alone, he made as many as four films, which itself sounds an amazing feat. Not so amazing, however, if you see `Today You Die' dreadful film with a dreadful title. The press material I managed to get at Japanese theater in Osaka (yes, they dared to release it theatrically in Japan) tells you that the film was shot in only 18 days. Small wonder that none of the film makes sense, gives less actions than awful dialogues. ---  --- Steven Seagal plays one Harlan Banks, ex-master thief who is retiring from his job. Banks turns a professional driver of cash delivery van in Las Vegas, but because of the robbery committed by someone else, he is arrested and sent to a jail. Is he framed? Of course, he is, but when he can wear his trademark long jacket in jail, and meets and enlists a help from someone named Ice Kool there (played by Treach), there is nothing to worry about.  ---  --- But I had to worry about because nothing makes sense in the film. We see a glimpse of one orphanage (briefly twice), but no one in the film seems to remember it. The film begins with a cheesy nightmare sequence that the girlfriend of Harlan sees (played by Mari Morrow) in her dream that portends death and danger, but this supernatural idea is just dropped in the second half of the film. There is a detective played by Sarah Buxton, whose motive to get close to Banks remains unclear, and Nick Mancuso adds confusion to the already chaotic scenario as Agent Saunders. ---  --- [DULL, DULL, DULL] The most impressive part of `Today You Die' is one car chase scene in Las Vegas with decent stunts and some nice camerawork. In fact, these scenes are recycled footages from one Sidney J. Furie actioner `Top Of the World' starring Peter Weller and Dennis Hopper (yes, I checked it yesterday). The rest of `Today You Die' consists mainly of terribly witless dialogues exchanged between Seagal's character and others, which goes like:  ---  --- BODYGUARD: "Who are you?!" --- SEAGAL: `Girl scout of America.'  ---  --- Naturally poor bodyguard is beaten up by Seagal clad in ridiculously long jacket, who does it with the minimum energy helped by lightening-speed editing and body doubles, which strongly suggest he is not willing to do the actions once he had shown in the films like `Above the Law.' ---  --- The film is strictly for the avid fans of Seagal, but I am afraid the number of them is getting smaller every year. I like his films in the 80s and 90s, and I admit `Today You Die' is not as bad as `The Foreigner,' but that isn't saying much
These are great fun!  My daughter loves to shake them and sing.  Brightly colored and good quality. They are fun for the whole family and just the right size for small hands.  They are good for play other than just musical, as they can be sorted according to color (if you get more than one) and put into things and taken out again; they lend themselves to hours of fun
These are truly good gluten-free cookies.  We have recently made the switch over to a casein-free (milk free) gluten-free diet for the sake of my son.  He is already a picky eater, so I was worried about the transition.  These cookies provided him with a yummy replacement snack for snack time that competes with the snacks that are being served (ie in church school etc).  He is particularly enamored with them because they have kid-friendly animal imprints.  Being gluten free, they do tend to break more, which can be upsetting for young kids, but they taste so good, he has been able to overcome this fault and is even willing to eat the broken pieces. 
This is a toy that my son always wants to play with and we've had this dinosaur for quite a while now.  Usually, we buy our son a toy that he pleads for (he likes it soooooo much) and it looks like fun but then it ends up in the back of his closet after a few days of playing with it.  This brontosaurus makes a booming sound with his feet when you pull a trigger underneath which both my sons love (4 & 2) and the included figures are great.  This toy stands up to the brutual tug of war that accompanies our two small boys and it is quite the bargain at the price.  I highly recommend all of the dinosaurs and cavemen in this series.  Not only does it keep my sons busy (oh yeah)  but it also helps built their imagination as I hear them tell each other all these stories about their dinosaurs.  Imaginext has even come out with "NEW" dinosaurs in this line which can be found at Target or other stores (I have found that TRU has a limited selection). 
I bought three of these for my two 6 year olds and my 7 year old.  Every one of them arrived in abysmal condition.  Strings everywhere... loose tuning screws that could not be tightened... and scratches.  I could not believe that anyone would sell something this inferior.  Shocking is an understatement describing this purchase
What a brilliant package!  It's a squeezebottle with a brush at the end, and has a twist on lid.  No spills, no mess, no disaster.  Love it! ---  --- It is easy to apply with the brush.  I have Lava Flow, which is a shimmery pink.  The shimmer is a more obvious than I would like, as it's big flecks of sparkle, but it isn't so bad that it looks like glitter glue.  There is a strong smell and taste, sorta tropical; although it isn't unpleasant, it is powerful.  Kinda reminds me of red Koolaid.  The color is a bright pink when first applied, but simmers down to a medium pink and is rather sheer.  In the container the color looks unwearable, but in reality it isn't dramatic.   ---  --- The only drawback is how sticky it feels.  It is less sticky than Mac's Lipglass, but more so than Urban Decay XXX, if that makes sense.   ---  --- I got this as a freebie and I'm glad I got to try it.  I would buy it but in a different color
After watching Myth Busters use one of these hammers during one of their tests. My father said we should buy a couple of these since we live in an area with quite a few rivers and lakes. The lifehammers appear to be very well made and I fully expect them to do their job if ever needed. The Sheriffs Office just recently pulled a body out of a local river, his jeep had gone off the road and ended up in the river, his girlfriends body was found right away, but it took several months to find his body. If they had had a lifehammer perhaps this accident would have ended better. The LifeHammer is cheap life insurance
The book appears to give comprehensive coverage in terms of the number and type of entries included.  However, on the Atkins diet, the important measure to monitor is the "active" carbohydrate mass which may  metabolised and which excludes roughage or fiber.  The inclusion of such a  measure in the book would greatly enhance its value and utility
 will not hold bose souround spkrs, will not mount for key hole speakers, also  i paid $11.99 for these on amazon, the saw them in wal-mart for $7.78 good for a cheap system, but if your speakers  weigh more than 5 lbs.  step u
Only the top 1/4 of the wipes are warm... if you don't refill the container continously, wipes get cold.  Plus, you might consider the ease of use with a pop-up warmer
I have been procrastinating in upgrading our website so I figured I'd read a few books... a great way to procrastinate some more.  Well Marcia writes in a step by step practical way, creating a marketing foundation first then getting to the beef.  I'm now educated and inspired, have a notebook full of notes and ideas that I'm actually implementing.  It's getting done.  I'm actually recommending this book to friends who are redoing their marketing message since the first two chapters do that so well... great book, not heavy, beefy info
Contrary to popular belief, I even had a good experience the one time I needed technical support. A few random disconnects, but overall a great product
If you've read anything already about these techniques - writing it down, visualizing it, tithing - this book offers no additional insights. And despite his "Official Religious Disclaimer" at the beginning of the book, it is packed to the rafters with the author's own religious dogma. If you share the author's religious outlook you may like this book, but otherwise it makes for very tedious reading
The jersey of our #54 got here for my wife in time for Super Bowl and she was very happy.(With the jersey NOT Grossman
I just bought 5 pairs of dickies everyday scrubs (from another online company) and was very disappointed. I picked Dickies because they were cute, cheaper than most, and seemed like they would last. The colors are really nice, but the light pastel colors are almost see-through. I tried them on and was able to see my patterned underpants through the scrubs. The ankles are tapered, not obnoxiously so, but definitely tapered. The medium bottoms have a HUGE amount of extra fabric in the belly. The fabric is rough, and feels like plastic
My favourite tea in loose leaf form... it just doesn't get any better than this.  The tins are a good size (not so small that it's gone after four cups of tea but not so large that it'll be stale and moldy before you could possibly finish it) that fit nicely in my desk at work as well as on the counter by the teapot.  The tea is fresh and flavourful with the quality I've come to expect from Twinings.
If you are looking for a book that does a cover to cover job of bashing western civilization with complete and obvious bias, this is it.
This holster offer's your phone ZERO protection.  Not to mention the fact that bumping into something can oftern knock the phone out of the holster.  While it does allow the phone to swivel, thus avoiding being stabbed by the antenna when seated, I ended up being the stabbing victim of the belt clip instead. ---  --- Not to mention the wear and tear from the phone hitting the pavement. ---  --- All in all, I would NOT recommend this holster.  I'm shopping for a holster and faceplate as we speak..
Koyaanisqatsi took seven years to make, from 1975 to 1982. There is not a narration to tell you what to think. This is an art film, in my opinion, the value is up to the viewer: Is this film meaningful? Does it have value? As a viewer I say yes. This film is a fusion of music and image. In Koyaanisqatsi there are 17 pieces of music and five movements all have relative relationship to one another. The "Grid" is a polyrhythmic piece of music. There are 11 polyrhythimic structues going on at once, and it matches with the time lapsed photography that is occuring on screen. About 350,000 feet of film was shot. There definitely was a method to this madness: after the explosion of the Grid, these polyrhythmic structures settle the audience down and the film ends the way it began: a rocket ship taking off. --- Godfrey Reggio more than expected a negative reaction by some people when he made this film.  --- What does this film mean? That is up to the viewer, like a piece of art work there may be a thousand or more interpretations related to this film. Is this film only for certain individuals? Probably. But I don't think there is any pretense in interpretating this films message. One does not have to pretend to like or dislike an art object; it has no intrisic meaning or value only what can be ascribed to it by the viewer. --- Godfrey stated that Koyaanisqatsi is related to Northern Hemisphere societies; super-sophisticated, hyper-industrial, technological grids that we call societies.  --- To me this film is about how humans have become one with machines. And how we don't live with nature any longer. We have become not affected by technology so much more that we have become so engrained in it we can no longer see out of it. That technology becomes the host in which everything happens and in that way, we do not use technology, it is a way of life. But like the air we breath we can not distance ourselves, as we deny that we are separate from technology and instead of moving us toward control of nature it has alienated us instead. The norms of nature no longer fully exist; it is rather the norms of technology that do. And in so doing technology has become omnipresent. Personally I don't have to pretend to like this film or pretend it is important. In fact it is, as its message is perhaps even more significant today as the world moves even closer to a homogenized society at the expense of natural and human diversity.This film shows that homogenization is in this process of globalization
Well it was an obvious path to musical collapse, she should have stopped at Tidal.  If I'd been dating her for the talent she showed on her first CD I would have broken up with her over this piece of haggis.  The course of the last three CD's drew a trendline right from stardom into a melodic pit.  The lyrics on Extraordinary Machine were not only not up to their namesake but worse than the melodies.  The number of great reviews on this site only go to prove once again the masses prefer pablum in lieu of something complex and cognitive. ---  --- Her original Cd with it's collection of diminished and augmented chords set to deep overlays of texturing, blended with truly poetic lyrics has been replaced with a distilled musical joke.  What on earth gave her the impetus to try to go 'artsy' by experimenting with music predating the second world war I'll never know.  It's obvious her angst is no longer producing art, rather it is being replaced with contrived resolution and the equivalent of a musical epitaph.   ---  --- Eat it up people, it's all about not having to think.  It's the kind of tripe that happens when someone is trying to hard to think of how to outdo their first brush stroke of genius and is confronted with musical block.  Judging by the news her father is ruining her life and creativity as so often is the case in todays less than feminine half of the culture.  
I bought this classic novel on cd thinking it would hold the interest of my 2 grade school boys, who enjoy books on cd while driving to and from school.  They did not like the narrator's snobby french accent nor could they understand many of the words.  This is a great cd for high school or adults but not children.  A bust for us. 
Purchased this for my girlfriend.  Told me that fits well and was very happy with this.  I am glad to get such a good price on them too
I had high expectations for these socks given my previous experiences with the brand. The socks were too narrow in the foot and too tight around the ankle. They are not comfortable to wear and overall, a big disappointment
If you're only slightly interested in the ways the evolution works, then this is it. But beware to have some knowledge about the basics of evolution before moving on to this book. There's a bit of a steep learning curve when you're not all to familiair with Darwin's brilliant theory. It also gives a nice insight in the way scientists work
A great magazine that keeps getting better as time goes on. I have watched it from the start and have continued to be impressed by Editor Jason Sizemore's growing tome to the darker side of Sci-Fi. With solid Interviews and strong fiction by established pros like William F. Nolan, Ben Bova, Tom Piccirilli, Neil Gaiman and Brian Keene and talented newcomers like Bryn Sparks, Jenifer Pelland, and Eugie Foster you can't miss with this one
I have seen this movie many times while growing up.  Its definately a different approach to Science Fiction, but not too bad.  Basically, you get to see how mortal enemies can work out their differences, and work together.  A movie with a message
fast shipping... great product .. very easy to use.. i highly reccomend this product if you dont want to deal with complicated  --- wiring and difficult to install alarms. this products works fine and VERY easy to work with
I'm dealing with getting old but I was surprised to find that I could no longer tune my guitar by ear. In fact, I was thinking the problem was with my old guitars. --- I decided to get a tuner. I did some research here on amazon and decided on this one. --- Reasonable price and the instrument store shipped in good time. --- The first time I used it I wished I had bought it sooner. --- Easy to use with either the lights or the needle. The guitars sounded great. --- As others have said: --- It's a little difficult to use the needle in a dark setting but the red/green lights are accurate. --- A simple flip out stand would be a big help. Plugging in a cord jack makes it very awkward to position. That being said the idea of putting a groove on the back of the thing so you can insert a credit, business or playing card to lean it against is both odd and better than nothing. --- Will have to see how long it holds up but I am very happy with it and I will use the instrument store again. --- 
I was very disappointed with this pump. It was very loud and stopped working after 3 weeks, and I only used it once a day. Even more disappointing was the companys return policy. You have to ship it to them at your expense, wait for them to send you a new one, and return that one to the store. Do not waste your time
I just received this locket, which was intended to be a gift for my niece for x-mas, and had to decline on giving it to her.  when i received it, i actually thought Amazon forgot to put it in the bag it came in.  I shook the bag, felt for the necklace, and finally out popped this itty bitty tiny heart pendant. it's so small, i thought it was more suitable for her doll then for herself. i was very disappointed. other then the size and over priced tag, i thought it was cute - but i will be returning it. --- sorry
My 4ish daughter LOVES this magazine, as do we. Each issue gets pretty tattered while she waits for the next issue. ---  --- Educational (for all of us) and entertaining.  She remembers the information given to her in the short and concise articles and enjoys testing us to see if we were paying attention. ---  --- A keeper for sure
The set look very nice.  The description DOES say that the cymbals are not included, so I will have to buy them separate.  I am buying this set for my nephew for Christmas.  He is in a band!  I hope he likes it
This my first pair of 100% nylon socks.  The problem I have is that my feet cannot breathe in them.  My socks are wet after a full day wearing them. I guess I'll just have to stay with cotton...I've never had that problem before with cotton/polyester socks. They do stay up above my calf all day long, though.
I received my phone and everything was good.  When I looked at my bill Amazon did not close out my previous 2 months I had left on my contract with Cingular.  So Cingular tried to charge me some liquidation fee of $30.  I called and had it removed
As a frequent visitor to the Himalayas and being closely in touch with both Tibetans (ordinary folks, not the tortured ones) and the Chinese, I find this documentary interesting but terribly one-sided. I have not met a single wealthy Tibetan in Nepal or India, who can swear to me that he will return to a freed Tibet, run by their government in exile.  ---  --- To be fair to the "experts", a lot of the evidence of Chinese violence against the Tibetans is real. I sincerely feel sorry for them and wish that they could somehow be compensated. However, the documentary gets emotive and it seems bent on presenting the situation in Tibet entirely from the viewpoint of the activists and other victims of Chinese aggression. ---  --- While it is true that many Tibetans suffered and died during the invasion and subsequent crushing of riots that erupted from time to time, it is unfair to assume that the soldiers and police were the only ones responsible for the deaths and injuries. Were there no looters, vandals, infighting? If you had ever witnessed these riots, would you think that more people might have been hurt or killed had the soldiers not opened fire? ---  --- It's also incredibly naive to assume that all Tibetans think the same. Even Dharamsala, the seat of the Tibetan government in exile is not without opposition, violence and even assasination. While I do think that most Tibetans are good Buddhists and nice people, the documentary seems to associate everything sinful with the Chinese and everything saintly with the Tibetans. This is something I find totally unacceptable. ---  --- A few snapshots of Tibetan mobs welcoming the delegates from exile tell us nothing. The documentary seems only able to find Tibetans who are against Chinese rule. They paint the picture that nobody in Tibet is happy. This is patently untrue. But then, this sort of thing sells in America. You have to have a demon, you have to have a damsel in distress and you must have the hero (America in this case). Otherwise, it just won't sell. It's not about compassion at all. ---  --- If you really want to be "illuminated", visit Tibet and Tibetan communities all over China and see things for yourself. That would be far more enlightening. Sadly, many journalists prefer to interview the wrong (right?) people in order to get a sensational story that will pay for the rent
First I would like to say that when I purchased this item it was advertised as the "Hobby" addition.  When I received it I didn't think it was the hobby set so I called amazon, the operator said she did not know about this product and provided me with the phone number to who sold it to me.  I called that number 3 times and left a message each time to please call me and I have yet to receive a phone call back.. When I gave this item to my husband for Christmas he confirmed my thought that it was not the "Hobby" addition.  I was not only upset that I did not get what I was looking for but that no one had returned my call
On install the 1st problem encountered was that it replaced  my pictures folder, with another containing only "sample picture", yep  it took out a folder on install with no request or user action to do so. Regardless of how it works as an image editor such behaviour precludes its further use.  ---  --- This program seems to be unsupported by MicroSoft, least their support site won't let you mail them on it,  so when it does hack up your file structure. SO program cost me $15 recovery effort on pictures, over $50. Just wonderful.
I loved this show and have been waiting for it to come out on something so I could watch the episodes again...I can't wait for season two to come out. If you were a fan of this show, you have to get it..
You don't want this one.  Although the fabric is appealing (calm stripes vs. the buzy themes of the other covers) this cover will not fit most shopping carts.  It only fits the carts found at small city super markets.  If you are a suburbian shopper you'll have to spend the bucks for  a more satisfactory product
very comfy and warm, my only downfall is that I could have sworn i read that two came in one set.  I ordered one thinking i was going to get two covers.  I have to order it again...darn
A family oriented film that is humorous, fun, exciting and very entertaining! After seeing this movie for the first time, I had to own it! It is hard to find a good comedy that is enjoyable for all ages that is clean. This is a must own for the family
This seatsaver is one of the few wide enough and tall enough for SUVs.  In contrast to one of the other reviews (and I am NOT affiliated with the seat manufacturer), this seat does the job adequately, and one should not post a poor rating without researching the specs, measurements, fit, etc., IMHO.  There is no "universal" seat saver or, for that matter, car seat, that will fit every car.  This one manages to catch most of the itty-bitty things that kids manage to somehow accumulate and is sturdy enough for the car seat not to make indentations on the actual seat, and hence, serves its purpose well
This is my favorite tea.  It's strong and spicy, and to me tastes like cinnamon and orange.  I prefer it hot but like it cold, especially in the summer.  I think it's the best thing on winter mornings
I bought the Meade CaptureView 8X42 1.3MP Digital Camera Binocular. The first one had software / hardware that hung up after 3 pictures, the second one had so many pixels missing from the screen it was unreadable, the third one wouldnt turn on and the black side flashing fell off on removal from the box. --- A truely tatty product
My Xbox was getting the red rings of death, figured this was most likely due to overheating, so I bought this thing. Not only did it not fix any of my troubles, I was having more. Whenever I would bump my Xbox, the whole thing would shut-off instantly. Found this out by accident, come to find out this thing has very bad connections. So for $20 you can buy more headaches than Microsoft is pawning off onto us game addicts...
I have multiple concerns with this product. Out of the box, they really do look fresh and plump like they do in the picture.  ---  --- However, you soon notice the lack of instructions. None. The only documentation at all is a "California" sticker... with no reference to a web site. Nada. ---  --- My grapes broke quickly. When I received them they looked just like the picture. But in a couple days I started noticing they weren't as plump and were shriveling. Withing a week, many were brown and certainly lacked freshness. It was so bad, that I was in shock, and I kept holding up the picture next to them to compare because I couldn't believe it. It was like they were deteriorating right before my eyes. ---  --- Within a month they looked awful. They looked like moldy raisins. Really Moldy. ---  --- Not recommended
Tony Nourmand's "Film posters of the 60's" is a wonderful and  colorful coffee table style book that is a great treat to look through.  There are many of the classic film poster images of the French New wave,  the films of Stanley Kubrick and the classic 007 posters, just to name a  few. Film poster collecting is a great adventure and this book reflects  that enthusiasm. This book was lovingly organized with great detail. A  superb value! Looking forward to future editions
Egad! Upon receiving this remote control, I found that it requires four AAA batteries. There was no mention of that requirement in the product description! I concur with the other review writer: the control is top heavy, and I would add poorly designed. It's thick at the top and thin at the bottom, making it unwieldy. I will be returning this monstrosity
The product, if reviewed just on taste, would only warrant a two, but the convenience is worth a five.  It is probably the best La Briute product that I have found.  It is a two minute meal that is not completely objectionable, but it is way too salty
I have two children now, and I wish this item had been available when my older daughter was born.  I have tried everything to keep my babies' heads from slumping over in the car, and nothing worked 100% of the time.  This however does.  It is one of the best things I have ever purchased for my child and it's very inexpensive
Once again Mr. Updike delivers an insightful story of life in suburbia and what lurks in the hearts and minds of men and women  - love, lust, betrayal, self doubt.  Villages relates Owen's life as only John Updike can.  The last chapter gets a little too long and not as enjoyable as the rest of the book, but I will certainly recommend it to all my friends
 this is a nice smooth green tea. actually, I have tried many flavors of Yogi tea, and they are all lovely. bedtime tea really does put me gently off to sleep. egyptian licorice has a nice little bite to it, and the women's formulas help with hormonal issues. I have not found a bad flavor. : 
I bought this camera after owning an Olympus digital camera for years. I was extremely happy with my Olympus, but wanted something smaller that would fit in my purse or diaper bag since I'm expecting. This camera was SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT. Just about every single picture I took had huge white blobs all over it. (This only happened when using the flash. I must admit the camera takes great pictures in broad daylight without the flash.) Plus, if you used the zoom at all, the pictures came out fuzzy. The first digital camera I ever owned (7 years ago) took better pictures! The store I bought the camera from wouldn't take it back because I waited two days past the 14-day return policy. So, I sold the camera and took a $100 loss. I'd much rather lose $[...] than keep this camera
This stand is very professional looking and is light weight.  It is very easy to manage when going from home to rehearsals and concerts while carrying an instrument.  It is very sturdy and easy to put together
The product does not work in my view. I have to review every card and have to manually correct the extracted information in 95% of the cases. It is not much different than entering the information manually. The character recognition software has a long way to go to be effective. Does not even recognize that "wireless" is the mobile phone number. One would think that they would get it right after all these versions and years. The only good thing is once you scan the cards, you can throw them away, but still have to spend the same amount time entering the information by hand.
I subscribe to all of the home and garden magazines and Southern Accents is the best, bar none.  The houses featured are absolutely dreamy--the photography is gorgeous--and while the magazine doesn't offer how-to decorating ideas, there is so much inspiration.  I find it to be intelligently written...which is rare in a decorating magazine. The articles on antiques are particularly informative.  This magazine will appeal to anyone who is interested in beautiful, classic design--whether or not you live in the South
About the Band: --- Dead Can Dance is considered the seminal example of the ethereal or heavenly voices genre.  In fact, the name of the label, 4AD, which carried many of the 1990s DCD releases, is sometimes also used to describe this genre of music, which is a fusion of subtle electronics, vocals, drums, world music, and a near limitless count of instruments.  Brendan Perry sometimes has been described as a gothic Frank Sinatra.  Lisa Gerrard's enchanting vocals are often sung in a language only known to Lisa.  I count myself among the many that hold these two musicians in the highest esteem. ---  --- About the Album: --- Compared to more recent albums that are loaded with bonus tracks, the 50-minutes of Into the Labyrinth would seem short, if it weren't for the fact that I like to listen to this album over and over again.  I count this album as one of my all time favorites, and certainly my most prized Dead Can Dance CD. ---  --- One of the nicest things about this album is that it features nearly equal amounts of both Lisa's and Brendan's ghostly vocals.  On some tracks they accompany each other, while others feature only one of the artist's chilling or mystical sounding vocals.  Simply put, this is beautiful music to relax to.  I honestly give this album my highest recommendations! ---  --- Two tracks I'd recommend sampling: "Towards the Within" (featuring Lisa's vox w/ Brendan backing) and "Tell Me About the Forest" (featuring Brendan's vox).  I believe they best represent the range of songs you can expect with this album.  Please note that while all the tracks feature vocals, the lyrics for only those sung in English are included in the liner notes. ---  --- Similar Artists: --- Chances are if you aren't yet familiar with Dead Can Dance, that you've not yet discovered some of these other bands, but I highly recommend them as well: Das Zeichen, Impressions of Winter, Love is Colder Than Death, Qntal, Corvus Corax, or Helium Vola.  There is a rather large (and somewhat underappreciated) range of artists still producing heavenly voices music that is similar in quality to Dead Can Dance.  Please check some of them out as well.
I put a great deal of interest in my purchases. With a lot of extra down-time at work and an internet connection, I find myself reviewing EVERYTHING before I buy it. And only after I am very impressed and convinced by many positive reviews will I take out my credit card. But this product, the Microsoft XBOX360 Media Remote, was one exception having read many bad reviews and deciding to purchase it anyway. Let me tell you... ---  --- This remote is PERFECT if... ---  --- 1. You would like one, easy-to-use remote to control both basic TV and an Xbox 360 that doubles as your DVD player. --- 2. The only buttons you would need for the TV are: Channels, Volume (TV speaker/output control only), Numerical channel input, Muting, *INTPUT SELECTION* (yes, it CAN switch between your TV's inputs), Return (to toggle between 2 TV channels), and Power. --- 3. You do not need specialized/advanced buttons found on a OEM remote or advanced learning remote for the TV. --- 4. You do not need to control a A/V receiver, DVD player (other than XBOX 360), or a digital cable box (Tivo, DVR, etc.) --- 5. You are on a budget but would still like a quality remote. ---  --- If you can say yes to all or most, then don't hesitate to grab one of these remotes. You will be completely satisfied. Especially with immediate access to the tactile DVD buttons versus the 360's annoying on-screen DVD navigation. For this feature it is almost worth the $30 alone. ---  --- P.S. --- I also own a Logitech Harmony 880 for the living room which I highly recommend for anyone not fitting into the catagory mentioned above
I bought this product based on my research of users opinions and found it has lived up to their high opinions.  I have boxes of family photos as well as numerous camcorder tapes of family events.  I wanted an easy comprehensive program that would let me arrange photos and video clips, add music and burn on a DVD.  This program does it all and more.  It may not do everything extremely well, but for the price, well enough to put out an impressive DVD.  After about two hours of getting familiar with the program, I was able to create a DVD that had 35 pictures and a video clip with background music - stunning results.  I played the DVD on several different brands of DVD players and had no problems.  Looks great on TV.  I've had no problems running the program on my computer - I'm running this on a Pentium IV 2.9 GHz, 1 gig ram and 200 GB ram HD.  Since I am a beginner/weekend hobbyist, this suites my purpose of sharing pictures with family - I'm finding much better to share on DVD than paper photos.  For an all-in-one package at this price, it does the job very well and I would recommend it.  
Having tried Senseo pods, Millstone, etc.  I was surprised that good old Folgers is just as good and in some cases better than Senseo's newer flavors.  While made for the Home Cafe these fit Senseo coffee makers and give you a good cup for a lot less than the more upscale brands
It's a pretty convinient bag.I put a Canon rebel XT with a Tamron 28-75 lens,a Canon 70-300 lens and a external flash inside and I still have the small pocket for wallet,keys etc. --- The only drawback of this bag is,you can not put in big lenses.The Canon 70-300 is the limit.But if you only have a limited gear collection,you need to give it a try
Here is a magazine that focuses on modern design and clean-line architecture without the trendy vibe that makes a competitor like "Wallpaper" an expensive, hit-or-miss read. What I like most about "Dwell" is its consistency in presenting interesting designs from around the world that look quite livable and fashionable at the same time. Even the advertisements are quite compatible to the flow of the magazine, so much so that they often look like they are part of the editorial. There is a very useful "Marketplace" section at the end that tells you where to get a lot of the art, furniture and accessories complementary to the designs presented. I have often used these helpful listings to find some interesting things for my own place.  ---  --- This magazine is definitely geared toward the urban loft dweller, but I like how they highlight homes with families in mind as well. Individual issues are often focused on either geographic or utility-related themes, thus keeping a library mandatory for future reference. The photography is superb. If you are tired of design magazines that seem to be talking specifically to designers, this is a great, reasonably priced alternative for people who simply appreciate great design. Highly recommended
As my brother said when flipping through this book, "If girls start acting like guys then what do we need them for?"  Why should you pretend to be someone or something you're not to get a guy?  If someone dumps you because you like mushy love songs, cry at sad movies, like babies and puppies, or because you have embarrassing girl products in your medicine cabinet, he isn't worth it anyway!  And why on earth would you sleep with someone who didn't love you enough to want you around the next morning?  "Think Like a Guy" doesn't guarantee you a perfect relationship anymore than The Rules or Stop Getting Dumped or Mars and Venus or any of the other ridiculous relationship books that have been popular over the last few years.  Be yourself.  If a man can't deal with that, then he isn't the right one for you
I absolutely love this scale!  It is easy to program and enjoyable to use.  Best of all, it's beautiful to behold
These are the BEST bibs.   I have tried many.   They do not peel, crack, etc.   I have used the same set of bibs for 2 years.   I just bought a set for my sister.   Worth the money
Pls tell me tat tis BoxSet is a JOKE!!!! Classic Rock - REO, Romantics ... BANGLES??? its more like Classic New Wave. Only thing good would be the price. Pls ... who ever the A&R people are ... pls ... pls ... design something bette
As much as I hear time and again that "Mindcrime" was the Seattle quintet's finest, I always have to argue that this 1986 gem is the pinnacle of their career. While I was a big fan of Mindcrime and it's predecessor "The Warning", Rage For Order is QR's most consistent release and is mezmerising from start to finish. In a word.."perfect". --- So few bands can boast having made a perfect album. I can think only of The Beatles (Sgt. Pepper & Revolver to name a few), Pink Floyd (The Wall, Dark Side), Dream Theater (Images & Awake), and Boston (Debut). Rage is an album to be listened to and appreciated. Released in the hey-day of "hair metal", this album has not one single song that lends itself to the tag. None of the songs, while very image provoking, could be easily made into an MTV hit. Although "Gonna Get Close To You" aired on MTV (rarely I might add) it didn't even scratch the surface of this album's potential.  --- Overall, the performances of each member outshine anything before, or since. DeGarmo and Wilton trade licks masterfully. Rockenfield and Jackson keep a very tight bottom end. Tate...well...Tate was THE metal singer at that time and this was his finest performance. --- While the mix was somewhat lacking, the production was incredible. Each song blends into each other perfectly. This was metal that was unique and completely original. I think the term "thinking man's metal" was coined at the time. That said, I can think of no other release at the time to which that term could be applied. Unlike most of their metal contemporaries at the time, Rage was athmospheric, intellectual, and surreal. Rage succeeded where Priest's "Turbo" failed abysmally. It was a stark vision of the future and the metal was more futuristic than we'd ever heard before. It was like listening to a whole new machine. It still holds it's own 20 year later, seeming as fresh and "now" as anything in progressive metal.
I just bought this camera and took it to one of my kid's indoor soccer games. The light was low, but not that low.  You should be able to take a picture without the flash. When I took the flash off, the picture looked fine on the preview, but came out completely black.  Yet the camera was able to take perfectly fine video at the same light level!  What a disappointment.  I am going to try to return it
I bought this necklace for my 5 year old Granddaughter.  The piece is beautiful, and has some weight to it.  Its very well made, and no one would guess the price I paid.  More than worth the price
The dual grips are kind of handy - it fits securely into place
It was simple to install on top of my RV. I was able to put a cover over the panel and keep getting the sunlight to charge the batteries. It charges even through glass on the inside of the RV
Colin Firth plays a teacher and passionate to the point of obsessive football (soccer for Americans) fan who manages to mangle his only functional relationship, thanks to his tunnel vision when it comes to his obsession and fanatical support for Arsenal. His self-centered attitude with no concern at all for his girlfriend's interests muck up what could be a good relationship. On the other hand, it is hard to see in the first place what the woman finds so appealing about Firth's character, Paul. Perhaps because she is so uptight and needs to loosen up and sees in him a way by which to learn to be less rigid. She attempts to get involved in HIS passion but does not quite have the rabid, feverish passion he has. Eventually the fact that he identifies himself so closely with his football club and its ups and downs leads to the demise of the relationship, but she comes to see that she likes his identity, which is strong, linked to football or not. She has also been carried away by a certain infectious passion about football because it is so much a part of his life. Of course, one could argue that this tale is a sad reflection on the idea that there is a genderlect and that women suffer more in terms of being able to communicate, but that belies the point here that sometimes an imperfect person can still be perfect for someone who loves him, faults, obsessions and all
    They say it will be delivered in its original carton, but they don't mention they have been opening up the boxes and swapping out the new console boxes with returned ones. ---  ---     The box came with two bright yellow strapping bands, and certainly looked sealed when I signed for it at delivery. Later that evening, when I cut the bands I was surprised when the top lifted open, the staples on the carton top were not attached and the box was already open. I cut the box open and started laying the parts out. when I pulled the carton containing the console out, the box end flap was open and smashed up where it had been put into the styrofoam. every thing else looked undisturbed. I pulled the console out of the box and could see that it must have been returned, the bubble wrap was torn, and the six screws to mount it were missing. ---  ---    I called schwinn and they are going to send me the six missing screws, and I called Amazon to tell them what was going on, I would have sent it back, but I had cut the box open and don't think there is any way I could cram it all back together.  ---  ---    Just look the box over carefully when they deliver it, the staples on the top were carefully centered between the holes where the longer staples that originally sealed the box were removed. They sure fooled me into accepting a opened box.
If you want UNCUT ORIGINAL version, ALWAYS look for ORIGINAL LICENSED Production. NOT US Release. Its a foreign film, it should not be US version to begin with~! HELLO!!!?? Why settle for LESS with US Version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with Jackie's Fighting Scenes. And US Release ruins the speed and sound as well.I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality. American Market always like to "Americanize" and "Control". Regional Code Regulation thing is one of the example to CONTROL the Market. Why not let everyone enjoy the same HK Original Release move the same way REST OF THE WORLD enjoys it ?? No one makes Hollywood American movies to "French version" or "Chinese Version" ~! This what Americans are doing~! Well, enjoy the cheap "American version" then~! LO
I really wanted a 3CCD model, but since I'm just starting out and need to buy other stuff, like a tripod, monopod, media, firewire adapter card, camera bag, etc. This fits the budget nicely and it is compact enough to carry it anywhere. Yes the USB connection does work, yes FireWire does work, although it took me a minute to figure out that a connection problem was the fault of the video software version I was using, not the fault of the camera
The Superyard was a fantastic buy for us consider that it has allowed us time to have dinner together in a marginal civilized fashion.  Our 9 months old loves to play in it specially since she can see us through it.  You can hook a bunch of toys to it to keep your child entertained.
Finally, an ab video that makes sense and works.  This video is truly innovative and unique.  Imagine having rock hard abs and great core strength without doing a sit up or a crunch.  You have to see it to believe it!  Mike Griffith makes this video fun, easy to follow, and very challenging for the beginner or most conditioned athlete.  With a short amount of time and minimal equipment, this program will stretch and strenghten your abs in a functional way.  I am a physical therapist and I use these techniques for patients with back pain as well as for performance improvement for athletes.  I have been using it myself, and it works
WHEN I FIRST TIME USED IT,IT'S BORKEN. --- AND I CAN NOT RETURN OR EXCHANGE WITHOUT BO
I purchased this product needing to work on a personal legal (nonbusiness) matter, so the noncommercial license was fine for my "home" use.  Good thing I checked with Corel after buying it and seeing the "Home Edition" captions not only on the total suite packaging but underneath the "WordPerfect" and "Quattro Pro" components (inside front box folding cover with velcro).  Corel ultimately confirmed to me that "certain components that are designed for the business customer, such as Legal Tools, MetaData Removal, Document Compare, Quickfinder to name a few are not included in the Home Edition version."  Corel needs to make this clearer in their marketing of the "Home Edition."  I focused on the word processing application, but the Quattro Pro application is also captioned as "Home Edition" so it may be missing some features available in the Quattro Pro included in other Suite versions (Standard, Pro, Student/Teacher, etc.).  The Home Edition may still be suitable for some users, but I'm a strong believer in "full disclosure."  WordPerfect itself is a great program.  Try setting point sizes with decimals in Word -- you can't.  Try changing the size of the font in legal pleadings in Word -- there's no direct control of it (the Microsoft site instructs you to change margins and number of lines per page to attempt to get Word to adjust the font size) [but remember, you need any WordPerfect version other than Home Edition to get Legal Tools]
I purchased the product, used it for 2 days and it has not worked since.  The compnay has yet to respond to my request for return, and Amazon excepts no liabilty.  Needless to say I wasted money
The product I ordered was not actually for sale!  Don't post an product if you don't have it in stock
The only good thing about this book is that it was short. Even in writing about a great man with incredible contributions to our country, Gary Hart repeats himself over and over and over and over again. OK, the Monroe Doctrine is important, I GET IT! ---  --- I read about 2 or 3 presidential biographies per month and I cannot remember a book as bad as this. If you want a quick view of James Monroe, you can read the first chapter and skip the rest but this book is not good for more than that
Lancome's Juicy Tubes in Simmer tastes like my beverage of choice, Orange Julius.  When you apply it, it feels like you're rubbing the tip of an orange creamsicle ice cream pop onto your lips (minus the cold, minus the cream).  The color is a very subtle pink-ish beige, but it provides enough glossy shimmer to keep your lips a-simmer!  This is my 4th tube of juicy (also a big fan of Spring Fling & Berry Bold) and so far this is my favorite flavor
This program does exactly as I expect. I am very pleased
If you are looking for accuracy and durability do not by this product
This kit will not only help you get started, it will help you stay with the program too
The X-Pad is a decent piece of equipment, doing a good job of keeping my laptop from getting too hot. My only issue with it is the lack of padding on the underside. I'm going to have to attach a piece of neoprene or something similar to make it more comfortable to have on my lap.
I was GREATLY disappointed in this DVD. Here's why: ---  --- 1. It's basically 60 minutes of warming up --- 2. The level 3 (advanced) is not THAT HARD. --- 3. The annoying "inhale, exhale" chant really makes it difficult to find my 'center.' I just wanted to tell her SHUT UP --- 4. I didn't break a sweat once.  --- 5. I used it twice and never plan to use it again. I mean, c'mon, I don't want to waste 1 hour of my day on something that won't get me results.  ---  --- I must say the ONLY THING positive about this DVD is the landscape.  ---  --- In short, rent this from Blockbuster or buy it used. Don't waste any more than 5 bucks on this. It's not worth it. 
I bought this slick looker for the desk in my office. I had a beat up 20 yo digital clock radio that had poor sound.However its tuner worked ok and I figured with the Tivoli rep I'd get some good listening along with the good looks. My office is inside the facility without windows so reception can be tricky...the tuner for the PA speakers in the rest of the office has to have the antenna just right. I was very frustrated to find that the radio simply couldnt hold a signal. A station would tune in  nice but the fade in and out to barely hearable. I bought an amplified antenna but didnt help. Then I tried it in a windowed room and same problem......I was very disapointed
SELLER WAS VERY TIMELY IN SENDING THE DVD AND THE QUALITY WAS AS DESCRIBED
Donot buy it. I got the stuff even past the expiration day
I was never a Richard Burton fan until I discovered this movie.Richard Burton's acting in this movie is top notch.Burton is able to pull you into his character of British agent Alec Leamas and make it all believable.Thankfully the movie is in black and white,because it adds to the overall suspense and mood of the film.The dvd transfer and digital 5.1 sound are excellent.It's hard to believe a movie from 1965 with no fancy gadgets or special computer effect's could be so entertaining,but it is.The question is will Alec come in from the cold or does he have one more mission in him
I registered for the entire Locomotion collection before my son was born and have been very happy with it. I love the theme, but the mobile was a big disappointment. It didn't fit the crib properly and although my husband tried to figure out a way to install it without any type of conversion kit available, he just couldn't attach it safely and we ended up returning it. Also, although the mobile matches the theme, I found that the colors weren't very stimulating. ---  --- We bought the Tiny Love Symphony In Motion Mobile instead and although the colors didn't match, our son got many months of enjoyment and stimulation out of it.
I have used these containers and the milk escaped by the time I reached home.
1. they leak --- 2. too expensive --- 3. they don't supply enough lids, so you have to buy more containers --- 4. doesn't work well for feedin
I got this for my mother at Christmas and she loved it. You can't help but notice the pendant when she has it on - Very beautiful design, sleek and stylish.  She gets compliments everytime she wears it. Even though this was just an extra gift I think it turned out to be one of her favorite things
First off I need to tell you that I've carried a swiss knife since I was a kid. I have most of the styles. But this one stands out as the absolute most useful for a rather strange reason. For me since I don't fish I found more uses for this in the most unexpected area. The "fish scaler" tool is one that I would NEVER use to scale fish for no other reason than the problem of having to clean it thoroughly, too much work. But this tool I have used more than any other on all my knives. I've used it to open ceiling hatches to change office lights, pick locks. to measure things (something you need more often than you think), to reach into thin areas to clear debris or push a switch and most of all as a back scratcher. Since there are no sharp edges on the scaler it's perfect to scratch those areas one can't reach. That's not to ignore all the rest of the tools this knife offers which I use except for the absurd "parcel hook". This tool is useless and yet Victorinox continues to install it on many knives. The only useful task I've found for the hook is to tighten one's laces on my boots when I snow shoe. Anyone else found something useful for the parcel hook? Please post it if you have
This was the first time I have bought this and am very pleased with it.  When you open the can, the tuna is in one solid piece and not all sloppy like other brands.  It tastes pretty good too.  Will buy again
it's got an alarm, stop watch, timer, lap timer, 5 alarms actually, a water break alarm, water resistant, although don't go aggressive swimming with it because water leaked inside mine, and when it gets hot outside, water vapor rises to the glass dial and it blurs out the time...but other than that, it's a great watch, finest i've owned in terms of digital watch, i highly recommend it
The Panasonic is very compact, very stylish SEXY as my wife called it, but the photos are very disappointing: they are way to noisy! Even if set on the lowest ASA setting at 80ASA it is just barely acceptable and they do get progressively worse anything above 100ASA. ---  --- The colours are good, and it does take very good videos, but still photos are just plain bad when compared to other cameras in Photoshop CS2. Of course it is easy to understand why: the native resolution of the images. If one investigates such things, will notice that the Panasonic is only 72 dpi, same as Sony's, Canon improves this to 180, and Nikon is at 300 dpi. It is not just about megapixels folks, but how those megapixels are recorded and at what resolution. Obviously a camera with 72 dpi will have more noise than one at 180 or 300 dpi.  ---  --- So before you buy any digital camera or thinking about upgrading to a newer model, do yourself a favour. Try 4 or 5 cameras in the same megapixel range at a good camera store by taking photos of the same subject in the same light condition. Set the camera for the lowest ASA and the highest picture quality in JPG format, take the photos, pop the SD card  into the computer, compare the images in Photoshop. Enlarge to full pixel size (100%), and and look at the meta data at the same time and you will see for yourself. That is what I did, since I was not very happy with the images my Panasonic produced! I had this camera for 11 months and 20 days exactly, and today I traded it in on a Nikon P5000 after evaluating over a dozen models including the Leica D-lux3 10MP camera, and driving the sales persons crazy with all the testing and spending 4 hours at the store, but it was very educational for them too
These work great for keeping the earbuds comfortably in place while allowing one to hear others speaking, say in a grocery store. Of course they do not provide audiophile quality sound, but they're great for listening to podcasts while doing the shopping.  ---  --- The only downside is they are bulky and so do not fit in any earbud holder while not in use. Taking the eargels off to store the earbuds off is possible but difficult enough to be annoying
I got the machine for my fat, muscle and water analysis as well as my weight. After 1 month of use it only shows the weight.  The scale no longer works properly.  It no longer shows anything else but the weight.  It was a waste of money
I purchased this for my husband. He hates to shave everyday and now he can without the razor burn. It is even as close a shave as if he used a razor! I saw it on the Consumers Number One pick for foil shavers and I am glad I went with their reccomendation
As a rule, I like the Seche products.  This polish thinner did not work for me and was a true disappointment.  I wasted my money on this one
Unfortunately ,I purchased this product . Thermometer and compass are not at all working. Thermometer always shows 65 F and Compass allways shows Err. I highly recommend NOT to buy this on
I am a fan of historical fiction, and this has to be one of the most historically inaccurate films I have ever seen! What bothers me the most is that the general public, who hasn't read the Tudor biographies like some of us have, will believe this stuff because it is their only exposure to the subject! I won't go into all the inaccuracies since other reviewers have already touched on them. Why tamper with history, when it was actually more fascinating than what was portrayed in this movie.
I love this product. It is easy to use and lots of designs to chosse from
I bought 2 of these and they are horrible!  Youu put them in and they sometimes work and sometimes dont its such a pain in the arse!
J&R packs them so poorly that over half of them were shattered beyond repair upon arrival
When I bought this CD it was for a little bit of nostalgia - Those Were The Days.  Since playing it once when it blew me away with the tracks and the memories, I have played it so often that if it were vinyl it would be worn out by now.  If you liked Mary Hopkins then this is a fantastic selection of her music and well worth a place in your collection
Wow! I use Pacific Foods beef and chicken stock all the time & I guess I expected more! Convenience isn't worth it if the soup is super salty and tastes processed!!!! Hardly any barley or beef! I cooked up one bag & I'm throwing the rest out
This is a great gift for that person in your family who still thinks fart jokes are funny or for ten year olds.  Only one problem.  Due to inconsistant sizes of jelly beans, the poor raindeer had a...dispensing problem on occaission which requires one to rip off the reindeer's head (thank goodness it's on a hinge) to alleviate the problem,  this could be traumatic to the more sensitive.. MERRY CHRISTMAS!!
I ordered the 50's Style Rockabilly Polka Dot Dress in a 1X. I am a full sized woman with a small waist and a well endowed chest. The cup size for the 1X looked to be about a C cup at the most. I sent back the 1X for the 3X in which the cupsize looked to be a D, the dress has no support what so ever in the chest area so a bra is a must for heavier chested women. The waist and back area was way too large in the 3x. I was not only displeased with the fit but the quality of the material is poor as well. The dots are screenprinted on so after a few washes they will begin to crack and fade, it does say handwash (but even still some of the dots are already lighter than others). I'm giving the dress two stars because the style of the dress is really nice and if you can get it to fit the right way its not a bad price at all, but it's definitely not a dress that your going to have around for a long time.
I'm on no wheat, dairy or sugar diet restrictions, and this is my treat that I really look forward to. (sometimes every day!) Thank you Nana's! And the price is great from Amazon
This is a 'must have' fragrance. It has an exotic scent that will have everyone around you asking "What perfume do you have on?".  It can be worn day or night.  The entire Burberry line is fantastic
Firstly I must say how much I dislike Jennifer Lopez so attempting to watch this movie has been a struggle since it was first released however I decided to brave it out for the sake of Ralph Fiennes.  Lopez plays a maid who falls for a guy who has loads of money (Fiennes, who is miscast, really) He thinks she is a guest in the hotel, she plays along. So she lies about herself for the rest of the movie and when all is revealed, it comes to a ridiculous ending.  There's not much else to say to this cinderella movie, except maybe that it's not funny. Lopez isn't a great actress, she and Fienness have about as much chemistry as a toothbrush in a toiletbowl
I am a busy mom of two young children.  This camera is perfect for capturing all of their cute faces and happy moments.  I love the fast cycle time. I love that I can take multiple pictures in seconds. Would recommend to anyone
I was hoping the book would be good.  most reviews are.  However the topics are not really covered at all, more introduced.  It was like talking to a drunk bloke about sports, most points are important and relevant but its presented in a way that makes it confusing.  They openly admit they dont want the book to be rated on the quality of the english.  Just as well, long rambling thaughts that don't form conclusions.  Not what I wanted or needed.  It actually manages to take the fun out of reading and texas holdem all in one go
I bought the C. Crane FM transmitter expecting to broadcast from my computer and listen to it on an FM tuner with headsets as I worked around the house and yard.  It broadcast 5 or 6 feet, max, out of the box.  I performed the power boosting "fix" and now it broadcasts 10-20 feet, if I'm lucky, before static overpowers the signal.  This was a disappointing purchase directly from C. Crane that in no way met my expectations.  If it requires setting the transmitter on a grounded metal plate and lengthening the antenna in order to bring transmission up to whole house and yard capabilities, build it that way from the get-go or state the limitations of this transmitter forthrightly. ---  --- I kept the transmitter because I wanted one for the car.  It's physically well built and works fine for that.  I also use it to play my Ipod through a radio...but, understand, the radio is sitting right next to the transmitter.   ---  --- If you want to transmit throughout your house and yard, look elsewhere
Let's face it. Nothing anyone says can sway a particular fragment of this movie's viewing audience one way or the other. Those who love J.Lo will declare the greathess of this movie, in a variety of ways.  Those who hate J.Lo will counter their every point in describing how bad it is. And those who love quality film won't waste too much time even recognizing that this movie even exists. Guilty pleasure, indeed! One thing you have to admit about J.Lo, she's consistent. She sings bad, acts bad, and is merely eye candy, for thoe who find her appealing. And this movie is full of all of the above, plus awful, cliche ridden, emotionally pleading writing that should be an inspiration to anyone with Hollywood writing aspirations, since this movie demonstrates how little talent it takes. At least it's had it's short, but sill way too long presence on the premium movie channels, cause for a while this piece of garbage was ubiquitous, just like the lead starlett. Maniupulative only begins to describe this drek. But that said, it's more than enough time wasted on this movie. I merely felt compelled to warn folks. Don't waste your time. It stinks
Having previously owned battery powered travel razors, I was always disappointed with their power and battery life. After all, what's the point ditching a heavier charger and razor if you have to carry a load of extra batteries and still end up stubbly faced? The Braun 370-BK was a pleasant surprise, however; powerful enough to hack through my hiking stubble and plenty of juice for an extended outing. I also liked the folding design which protects the cutting surfaces and keeps the cleaning brush from getting lost. A great piece of tech at a good price
I got this product when the price dropped down to $12. So for that price I liked this product a lot. It heats the lotion well. Initially I thought it was small, but now I think it is the correct size. I did not realize how much better it is to apply heated lotion until this. I switch it on when I go for a bath and by the time I am back, the lotion is ready and warm. It is a great buy, and for all you bargain shoppers, wait till the price drops. It is  especially a great buy during winter
I was pretty excited about this player, having read about it in Runners' World. There are a lot of problems with it, however. While it is advertised as a sports MP3 player, in a lot of respects it isn't very convenient for someone who buys it for sports. My issues are: --- - Headphones are not at all appropriate for sports, particularly running.. they keep falling off, so I had to invest in a better pair of headphones. Kind of weird since it's supposed to be a sports player. Also, I spent at least five minutes everytime untangling them before I could use them. --- - Hard to change music while running, and it often ends up doing something I don't want it to. You can't change the music without removing the MP3 player from the armband, which is a major pain and is just a function of bad design that you can't tell from any picture. --- - Not easy to figure out the features of the player, such as the stopwatch, pedometer. Also hard to use once you do figure it out. --- - Software is a pain to use. --- - Organization of songs is annoying and difficult to maneuever on player. ---  --- That being said, I still use it. There are some good features: --- - Long battery life, recharges super quick --- - Very cool-looking player --- - Very easy to carry around.. can slip it a pocket or a bag of any size.  ---  --- I would not recommend this player and if given a choice, I would not buy it again.
Will someone PLEASE produce a DVD/VHS re-make of DIVA with the excellent sound quality deserving of this film!? I was so excited to finally find this movie, but quickly realized after reading reviews from fellow fans, that it would be a disappointment and waste of my money to purchase it. I hope the word gets back to whoever reproduced this movie and they'll re-issue a quality DVD and/or video soon
They get the job done, but the handles are a little thin and can get uncomfortable during the last couple of set
I owned this as an LP and played it over and over on my tiny, mono phonograph.  I loved it then and I love it now. Rainmaker, I'm On My Way Back Home and Love Is All That I Ever Needed would all have been sucessful singles. I Would Have Loved You Anyway is the only song I don't really like but the lyrics are unintentionally funny. All the lyrics seem more suggestive now than they did then but that's ok! The background singers get a tad tiring but Go David Cassidy! I don't care if it's the memories or not, I enjoy putting this on and turning it up
Another torrent of mild tripe from everyone's "favourite" DJ, Tiesto.   --- What on earth is he going to do when the supply of inane, pastel-coloured eurovomit dance music runs out? --- When I think about the number of times I've heard him touted as "World's Number One Best Voted DJ" or "DJ Mag Top 100 Finalist", you'd start to think that the man can actually mix records, when in fact rather than mix them, he tends to grind them together roughly into a nightmarish aural paste then reconfigure them violently in new, unusual and horrendously nauseating forms.  I can absolutely confirm this. I have had the startling and displeasing experience of witnessing it live.   --- The sad truth of the matter is, that there are any number of drug-addicted fluoro-pants-wearing 16 year old ravers out there, and all are quite willing to buy boring rubbish like this.  Or at least all are prepared to ask their mum and dad to buy it for them for xmas. --- I sign off in disgust
My husband and I finished off a bottle of wine before assembling the unit. : ) It only took us an hour and a half to assemble, and our kids were running around like a couple of nuts during the process. After we finished the assembly, we both took a turn on a preset program. The machine is extremely sturdy, quiet, and worked like a charm - just like a unit found at a gym. We're extremely pleased with our purchase and would recommend it to anyone
A friend brought me a large bottle back from his trip to Mexico.  I threw out all the other store bought vanilla bottles I had.  They do not compare to this one.  It has a strong, rich flavor.  I add to it everything I can.  My chocolate chip cookies and french toast could not be complete without Molina Vanilla
I go to Anime expos alot. And to to be honest this sword aint half bad. Unlike its 67' brother its only 37' but its a whole lot better to wield. Combat Ready, Very Sturdy and made in CHINA. I notice some swords made in PAKISTAN! and they usually end up breaking so this swords worth the buy if your a bleach fan and if you wanna save some cash
We bought this for our 8 year old son for Christmas. He absolutely LOVES It! It goes just fast enough and is well designed for a comfortable ride. Brakes work very well. Riders need to start off slow and get a feel for the turn radius. Given the chopper style, long nose...quick tight corners usually mean you are in for a fall.  --- I suggest getting a motorcycle style riding helmet for safety. --- Easy to put together... a no brainer. --- Well worth the cost.  --- He told us he loves feeling the wind in his face, shirt sleeves flapping...I think we have started something I may not want to deal with as he gets older. Future Harley riders look out! --- 
A little outdated, quite a few beers here aren't made anymore. Beer reviews are always personal opinion, and you'll read a bunch of people complain in these reviews that this guy doesn't know what hes talking about. I'd ignore what they say, everybody has their own preference. --- Think about this before you buy this book: --- 1) Why do you need to hear what somebody else things of beers? --- 2) its very out dated... 5 years is a long time
I bought four of these and all of them broke within the first or second use, making them completely unusable.
It didnt work as good as the teflon curling iron i had a couple years ago, it works just as good as a regular non-teflon curling iron
I've been playing NCAA 2007 for a few weeks now, and here are my thoughts: --- 1) The game simply does as good a job at capturing the feeling of it's sport as any other game.  Anyone who has been to a big-time SEC game understands that the stadium does shake. --- 2) I did not play the "career" mode, I simply prefer control over the whole program. --- 3) Gameplay is very strong, anyone who has played NCAA or Madden in the past will notice the tightening up of the controls. --- 4) I personally do not like the first person camera on special teams plays, it makes it frustratingly difficult to return kicks. --- 5) Likewise I could do without the auto slo-motion on "key" plays.  It absolutely destroys the flow of the play to highlight a catch or hit during the play.  EA, that's what replay is for. --- 6) The system is annoyingly apt to hit me with unsportsmanlike conduct penalties, not just on TD's but simple catches or defensive plays. --- 7)You now have more control over recruiting with in-season recruiting, including mulitple pitches and on-campus visits. --- 8)After all these versions can EA come up with a new set of unlockables.  Changing the logo, or the sponsor(!) does not a new unlockable make
This record is one of the best that has found its way out since the new millenium. I am partial to good songwriting and Bill's particular folk-country-alt-emotive sound. The tracks to me all over the place and take it from someone who has been there and back -it was well worth the trip
Has the effect of thousends $$$$ watch. I love it. One of the best deals i`ve had from Amazon this last years
I tried to like this product.  As previous reviews have said it has significant design limitations.  If you only need a 2D floorplan there are better tools for the same money or less.  The object libraries that come with the tool - furniture, fabrics, etc. - are really lame.  This limits it's value as an interior design tool.  I did not attempt to return it so I cannot comment on their return policy
After reading the reviews on this table we thought we would gamble. We were very disappointed.  The packaging arrived torn and open in several places. Only a few screws came with the table, not that this made much difference as there were table parts missing too. The parts that did arrive were chipped practically in every corner and the paint rubbed off. Amazon were efficient in having the item picked up for return and refund
He was exelente, but I continue insisting deveria to at least place a paguina with translation to the Spanish on the item.  Thus they tendrian but trade here in Venezuela,   --- without but one takes leave of you     ---  Emerson.
I purchased this product thinking that it will be better than the hand held models or the scale type models, since it combines measurements from hands and feet for a more accurate measurement of body fat.  The scale part works normal, but the Body Fat measurement is higher by 20 - 30%, compared to Tanita BC554 scale or Omron HBF-306C hand held.  Omron, replaced the unit, but the new one is also inaccurate.  Now, I'm tying to get my money refunded, but Omron does not want to take the unit back
I agree with the last reader.  I didn't finish this book, it was SO boring.  NOTHING happened.  And the characters were annoying.  I read a lot of books that aren't action-oriented and like them.  But this one was  awful
I rate this piece of equipment as 4 stars because I have not used it enough to know if it does everything it claims....however I have been amazed at how this little contraption does wonders on my back.  ---  --- When I first got this lumbar extender I set up up in about 2 seconds and then stretched backwards to lay on it. OMG, as I laid down it was like I couldn't even breath for a brief second. To actually feel my back being forced into shape nearly took my breath away as all the muscles were pushed around. I had to relax and it was amazing how sore the muscles in my back were from leaning over my computer at work.  ---  --- Having used it for about a month now, my back has started to feel much better and I am sleeping better too
Mill states here that he still believes traditional gender roles (as we now call them) are desirable, but, being John Mill, he passionatly believes in the freedom of lifestyle choice for the individual.  Hard to argue with that
i was gonna make a point, but fabz made it for me  i was gonna say that nowadays an cd is considered tight just because it has a couple of hit singles  and Yayo's hit singles werent really hits  his songs were on the radio & tv for probably about a month or two  if thats what you call a hit then you crazy  the fact is it takes more than 4 good songs to make a good cd  he said that there were 4 hot songs on the album but failed to mention that there are 17 SONGS on the cd   a couple of good songs dont make it good cd  you want to see what other people think of the Yayo album read the reviews for it  and jeezy  please  he always been garbag
I'm a HUGE fan of Christopher Lawrence's stuff, but I aboslutely refuse to buy this CD because of the copy protection.  I do not pirate music, and should be allowed to copy music I purchase onto my MP3 player of choice.  This is just sad
I love Canon products and I have had a complete Canon system for about 10 years.   I love everything Canon does.  However I do not understand Canon's reasoning behind producing this lens. ---  --- The reason for the EF-S lenses is offering wider angle by getting the rear elements of a lens closer to the "film" plane.  They cannot do this on film and full frame sensor cameras because the mirror is larger and would hit the rear elements of an EF-S lens. ---  --- They have indicated, however, that by 35 mm that advantage is gone.   Why then do they produce a 60 mm Macro lens when they already have their macro requirements covered with they current three lenses?   I would guess that the short back focus makes the lens cheaper; but this lens is only $60 short of the excellent 100 f2.8 USM Macro. ---  --- As I said, if for $60 I can get a lens that has 40 mm more reach (66 in 1.6crop cameras; useful in macro photography) and that works on ALL CANON CAMERAS, I'm not going to be thinking about this lens at all. ---  --- Granted, you might not be thinking of buying a FF camera anytime soon, but Canon has indicated that eventually they will have FF on all their DSLR's, so why bother with this lens? ---  --- The 17-85 or 10-22 are very reasonable offerings for the EF-S lineup, but the 60mm macro doesn't make any sense to me. ---  --- my $0.0
I purchased this item judging by its comfort factor. All's well except the buckles do not have pins to hold the straps in place. The straps slip off occassionally, causing the shoes to come loose.
Had great expectations, for the expensive subscription you get some really great coverage of neat hardware hacking stuff happening out there (and available on the web). The how to make stuff takes many many unnecessary pages, get the feel that they are trying to fill the pages with large photo spreads. Still has a way to go before it becomes a successful combination of Wired magazine, Elektor electronics, and hardware hack websites. Would definitely like more stuff like making an XYZ mill/router instead of a feature on the MIT fab lab. In spite of all the above I have renewed the pricey subscription - am still hoping ...
This powder is great. It has great coverage without looking cakey. I also have sensitive skin and this has never bothered me. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it's still a little dark for very light skin and it needs to be "touched-up" a little more often than other powders I've tried, but it's worth it
This tea is comforting when feeling ill or under-the-weather.  Also it has a pleasant taste.  I highly recommend it
As an IT professional I would strongly recommend against installing Norton 360 on your computer.  I have been a big fan of Norton Security for years and I have it installed on all my home computers for years.  After installing Norton 360, it erased most of my security settings and my computer continiusly crashed.  It messed up on of my home computers to the point that not only it would crash several times a day, but I couldn't even use System Restore to recover my computer and I was forced to rebuild the system from scratch. ---  --- Don't believe the promise to install it easily on 3 computers either.  Symantec makes as difficult as possible for you to download the software and isntall it. ---  --- I am ready to switch to McAfee
My 7 year old son received the Giga Ball for Christmas. It was a big hit. He and all of his cousins had a great time with it for several hours. Unfortunately, the very next day, it pretty much fell apart. I didn't expect it would last very long, but had hoped that it would last more than one day
Mario and Luigi Partners in Time to me takes me back to the SNES, with the first Mario RPG "Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars" a game I absolutely love (and would also recommend to anyone with an SNES or an emulator). The reason is the general gameplay for this RPG hasn't changed. You move around different screens, attack the enemies, fight bosses, etc. There is definately a unique (and I suppose you might consider it simplistic) ideology that this game follows. It's an easier version of action/RPGs, you level up, battles aren't random (you can see the enemies you engage on screen) though it is turn-based. This game plays and feels much like the original legend of the seven stars, but has added its own twists and funny little story line to make it, it's own game. ---  --- I highly recommend this game to anyone who doesn't mind a lot of chatting, but even more action and puzzles! Another homerun for Mario RPGs
I purchased these as a Christmas gift for my daughter.  They take way too long to heat up and the clips leave a crimp mark in her hair.  For the money I don't think they were worth it
Just got this in the mail:  If I allow SI to charge my credit card NOW for a subscription that isn't due to renew until 12/24/2007, they will send me 60 issues for $39.00, or .65 per issue.  I have the right to discontinue this automatic billing at any time.  So there is a very slight savings, somewhat offset by the fact that they will use my $$$ for an extra 9 months or so (recognizing that at the typical bank interest rate of 2%, that interest is worth about 50 cents, so I guess it pushes the per issue rate up to .66)
This is a nice looking watch overall. If you like this style in Black, look for the T233XLTMN.  It is a very very nice watch, and popular in Europe.
The music here frequently reminded me of Pagan's Mind with a touch of Porcupine Tree and flashes of Iron Maiden.  A fantastic mixture of 1970s Progressive rock bands such as Yes and Kansas molded with European-style Power Metal and Brazilian folk music.  While this can be extremely interesting there are a few moments here and there that don't quite mesh.  In actuality I give the CD 4.5 stars for its superb songcraft and inspired, sometimes flawed ambition.  But as an overall package, this Special Edition of "Temple of Shadows" is an excellent place for newcomers as the bonus DVD holds a concert in 5.1 surround sound that is loaded with songs from their back catalog.  This is a great album filled with high quality Progressive Power Metal and a DVD concert that gives a taste of their other albums (not to mention it's just plain fun to watch as the band members are clearly enjoying themselves, smiling throughout the show).  Highly recommended.
Playboy magazine, while luring people to open the cover with promises of female flesh, consistently has excellent articles focusing on issues of civil rights, civil liberties, and the defense of them all.  Trancending partisanship, Playboy is a beacon of stewardship over the rights we all take for granted daily. --- And the pictures are nice
wonderful game a true challange for any die hard friends fan two big thumbs up!!!!
Inis has become my favourite perfume, every time I wear it I am always being asked "What perfume are you wearing?" It is light, fresh & fragrant, not overpowering but makes an impression. I have tried lots of perfumes but none compare to Inis. The fact it is not tested on animals is a bonus and also it is not too expensive. Can't recommend it enough. Buy and try
I sent this to my in-laws foy Christmas and they LOVED it!! They recently added a backyard garden and they are thrilled to have it and love how it looks. I am told it is quite comfortable as well
This is one of a series of horror anthology movies released by Amicus Studios in the early 70's.  (i.e. "Tales From the Crypt", "The House That Dripped Blood", "Vault of Horror").Each anthology is held together by a certain theme.   ---  --- In "Asylum" a young psychiatrist interviewing for a job in an asylum is told that the head of the asylum has gone crazy and is now a patient.  The young psychiatrist must hear the stories of some of the patients and then determine who was the head of the Asylum.  If he is correct, he gets the job.  ---  --- The stories give the feel of old horror comics, which inspired many horror anthologies. The characters are one-dimensional and driven by such deadly sins, as greed and lust. In most cases,  with a twist and a touch of macabre, the fates get their revenge on the evil-doers. ---  --- The stories are mostly enjoyable and solid entries in the horror anthology genre. The British countryside, where the stories are mostly set, adds an extra chill.  ---  --- The movie is recommended most to fans of horror anthologies, such as HBO's "Tales From the Crypt" or Stephen King's "Creepshow", and the movies noted earlier.  It would also be great for those who remember how much fun these movies were when they first came out.  ---  --- More general audiences would be entertained, but I don't think this movie should be ranked with 5-Star horror masterpieces ("The Exorcist", "Halloween", "Psycho"), nor would I expect most general audiences to rank it so highly.    ---  --- The DVD quality is definitely noteworthy, having sharp, rich colors which enhanced the movie's experience.
I received the lens adapter but there was no info on how to use it. It screws in over the regular ZOOM lens but offers absolutely nothing to the use of the KODAK DX6490. I suspect there are additional filters or other accessories that might make the adapter useful and hope to find out what they may be in the near future. The lens adapter by itself, doesn't seem to add anything to the use of the camera without something else ??? --- Ben Boykin, Las Cruces, NM 8801
Come one people, Windows Vista is not only as unstable as it's Windows predecesors with a very uglu memory management and a really unsecure and ineffective hard drive and files management; I've lost lots of very important files due to Windows "errors" that shut down applications and even the PC itself, so i decided my self: TO USE LINUX OR TO DIE WITH MICROSOFT !, and i'm still alive ! ;-) ---  --- As i told you, Vista is nothing more but a cheap copy of visual effects that Linux users had from several years from now; in facto, right now i'm using a Linux version called Sabayon and it is a million light years away from Windows Vista, it's visual effects are simply incredible (try searching "Beryl" in youtube for you to know what i'm talking aboyt), i have not only 3D windows, but 3D Desktops, incredible effects to minimize and maximize and a veeeery looooong list of features that you have to see it for yourself to beleave it. ---  --- I know that you might be concerned for several aspects at this points that wooried me in time (when i was evaluating Windows Vs Linux): --- 1.- My Documents, that will happen with them?. Nothing will happen, in fact you'll ba able to open them and modify them as you please, the OppenOffice suite is totally compatibble with your Microsoft Documents. --- 2.- My programs?, well there are several options to run Windows programs in Linux, as "cedega", "wine", etc etc etc, si it means that you will be able to run most of the windows programs in Linux. --- 3.- Is it hard to use ?. No way !, it's as easy to use as Windows, you will only have to dedicate a few time (may be a couple of hours) to understand several conceps as the multiple destops, the file system, and the users and permission management (that is the one of the most secures in the world) (Microsoft Windows cant's say that!). ---  --- So, if you don't beleave search google for sabayon and youtube for beryl and you will open your eyes!. ---  --- So... think about spending this 400 bucks twice, because Sabayon and other versions as Ubuntu, Kubuntu, some versions of SUSE, and other Linux distributions are TOTALY FREE of charge!. you only have to download them and burn it to a CD or DVD, whatever you like.

This game is fun- you get to pick a race car and run amok among cities.  You can even go the wrong way.  For me (older adult) it was fun to play with my kids, but I found it repetitive and boring after a while.  Of course my kids love the gamecube and really like this game
I purchased the Rino 130 specifically because it also had the  radio and NOAA features.  Fortunately I read the other reviews on this model as well as the 120 and 110 versions that complained about poor radio performance. I tested the unit and sure enough the radio performance is absolutely terrible, and I was able to return the unit to Amazon in time for a full refund.  Be sure to test this yourself.  Also the buttons are very small, and the zoom function is impractical as you constantly have to activate the zoom and then slide the zoom level up and down.  I returned the Rino 130 and purchased a Garmin Etrex Legend C (color display) for about the same price.  I will miss the NOAA feature of the 130 but not the radio.  This is an overpriced GPS.  Spend the money on a color display unit instead and you will not be disappointed
This is simply the best remote you will ever need for all your infarad remotes!  I have a Chinese satallite receiver that I could never get it to work with all other "universal" remotes.  I was able to teach this remote to work with it!  This is a small computer
The product was delivered in a timely manner and functions properly
The thing you are likely to use most is the nail clipper. But it is very blunt!!! And the special cover on the clipper makes cutting the nails impossible, unless baby's nail is very very long. If I wait until the nails are long enough to cut by this thing, my 3-month-old would have scratched his face and head. I end up buying a new baby nail clipper with a big handle and magnifying glass from nearby pharmacy. That worked much better.
Any manufacturer that doesn't fully label their product should not be trusted. I do not see a list of ingredients here (but most nail polishes don't bother to do this anyway). The problem I see is this...this nail polish totes that it's safe to use during pregnancy due to the fact that it doesn't contain the above ingredients, but what DOES it contain instead? If it wears well, doesn't peel, give good color coverage, it's got to contain something in the offending ingredient's place, logically.  ---  --- Please ask yourself this before you sigh relief and Add to Basket! Phthalates, for example, are a class of industrial plasticizers that were invented in the 1930s. They are often used in nail polish because they make nail polish flexible, and they are used in other products because they help bleed the chemicals of fragrances and help lotion better penetrate the skin. They aren't required to be labeled on the products. Lab animals given dibutyl phthalate had higher numbers of offspring with birth defects, especially of the male reproductive system. A nail polish may not contain phthalates (and brag about it), but may contain a related plasticizer that essentially is just as harmful. Does this contain phthalic anhydride, a toxic chemical hardener? How about FD&C color, such as Yellow 5? It's a petroleum-based color that is also questionable when it comes to safety.  ---  --- Basically put, no nail polish is safe during pregnancy. On top of that, while your at it you should review every lotion, foundation product, etc that you use if you're concerned about things like this. I think it's great to be careful - more power to you - but be fully informed, not partially. Companies prey on our worst fears, and what is worse than harming our babies? If this product is so great, let's see an ingredients list (and all cosmetics should do the same, while I'm sounding off on the subject!) 
I have had an early version of this watch for 17 years, and when it malfunctioned, I decided it was time to get a new one.  The previous watch had been repaired 2 times earlier, and unfortunately every time I got it back from COSERV, it would be less and less accurate, thus I decide to get a new one.  The new one was made in Maylasia vs Japan (I have read on this site that one needs to be concerned about that), and was lighter in weight, but kept time well for about one week.  I bumped the watch on a table (nothing severe, the previous watch endured much more) and it immediately started gaining more than 10 minutes per hour.  I had high hopes that this watch would at least meet, and hopely exceed the durability of the previous watch, but it did not make it passed one week of casual wear.  I returned it in disappointment
And so does Gadget Dad and Gadget Kids. ---  --- Not only is it an affordable piece of equipment, but it's great for the whole family. ---  --- Having twin boys age 13 and a husband and I who all added a few pounds of winter wool over the last few months, we really needed something that was going to fit nicely into our busy lives.  This does just that! ---  --- I'll admit, I was a bit upset when I found that Gadget Dad had ordered it because I was the normal skeptic, but it's been well worth the investment and then some
Works well. Driver installation is somewhat tricky becuase it is not obvious which driver among all on cd you have to install. No synchronization software is included so you have to use a third-party tool like bitpim. Which is ok
When I first played this game, I got bored in 10 minutes.All you do is shoot and kill people for nothing, have the police chase you and you shoot them, Bring girls into your car and do it with them. I dont recommend this game at all its overrated
I did read all the reviews and was afraid something bad could happen during delivery. My fears proved wrong. I received a heavy package not damage, with all contents inside. The bike is working well and it is really a great exercise bike
Crashed the system every time I tried to use it...   gave me such a headache I tossed it in the trash...
A very good product. For traveling people with GPRS Internet access.  The charger is good when you are away of power. --- The MPT version is Ok but more value is for seem editing (for professional and expert users only)
I bought this dvd after reading all the great reviews and I was VERY disappointed. First off, it is outdated and that is annoying with the annoying music- but the background exercisers really bug me too. Not only that, the moves are strange. She does a lot of shoulder work moving back and forth with her feet to the beat of the cheesy music. I found my neck hurt A LOT after that. The leg section would be good if there was another way to position yourself. The ab section too was so old school, I was hoping to find some new exercises. I love Karen Voight but this dvd was definately the worst I have yet to purchase of hers. All the other Karen Voight I own I absolutely love
I was happy at first when I got this memory card but when my phone crashed the memory card was completely wiped out.  I was ok with the memory card getting wiped out but when I tried re-formatting the card my phone, computer and laptop couldnt even read the card so I ended up throwing it away.  I guess You really get what you pay for
Some will mistake me for a Evidence hater, but I'm really not.  I just want the man to put some effort into what he does.  I'm tired of taking just any ol' thing artists throw at us nowadays because the "fans" don't expect very much -- or simply don't know what good is anymore.  Sure, you can relate to what Evidence is saying, but you can put on a dope instrumental CD, sit with a friend or knowledgable hip hop head, have a discussion about any topic, and the resulting feeling will be something like the feeling you get from this album.  I quickly get tired of the "slow flow" -- see: talking -- and I feel like anyone can do it.  I don't shell out money for things I can do myself.  Really, the only difference between him and 50 cent is content.  When I hear someone say "slow flow" my mind translates that into "reduction of standards to make it easier for cats to get on" because this album would have been thrown out the window before the jiggy invasion came.  And lot of these beats, though very dope, are as slow as his flow is.  Couple that with the fact that there are a lot of wack guest appearance from cats like Joe Scudda (I'm sorry, I tried to like him, but dude is simply terrible), Big Pooh (same goes for him), and Madchild and you have an album that can have a drowsying effect on the listener.  The only dope guest shots come from Phonte, Planet Asia, and Slug.  Yeah, I know the fans and jock riders will hate and call names, but I'm going to keep it honest -- fu** real. ---  --- When Ev actually puts his back into it, he creates some dope material.  "Down With New York City" is nice piece of work that has Ev gettin' busy over an air tight Jake One track.  "Chase The Clouds Away" is another track where Ev does his thing over a pounding ALC production.  The standout to me had to be "Line of Scrimmage" which features Ev and Atmosphere frontman, Slug, getting nice over another dope ALC creation.  With the likes of Alchemist, Sid Roams, Jake One, DJ Khalil, Babu, and Evidence himself providing dope beats, I'd have to say that the production is definitely the strong point of the LP. ---  --- Simply put, I don't recommend playing this CD while operating heavy machinery.  I respect Ev and his whole crew (hell, I love Rakaa), but this album will make you nod off instead of nod to the beat.  I can only call it the way I see it regardless of whether or not the artist is a favorite of mine or not.  Bring on the unhelpful votes if you want, but I can only recommend this to the die hard fans -- who should eat this one up.

The first time we set the arbor up we found the top would not fit over the frame.  Two parts pulled off the top trying to get it to fit.  The seller forwarded the photos and complaint to Texsport and they sent us another top.  When we put that top on we found the same thing.  That is when we found the frame was 4" longer than the top.  There were seams that were not sewn properly and there was a hook missing on one corner.  After cutting the poles down we were able to get the thing put together.  When next spring comes we will replace this one and I can assure you it will not be a Texsport product
Want a sure fire way to kill your party??  Put this DVD in, turn the music off, make people sit down and play this game.  It was not fast, it was not frightening, it was not fun. Your guests would have more fun watching the paint dry in your basement

Having just read the book (most highly recommended) I decided to treat myself to the movie. I could have cried. While I did not expect the movie to contain everything from the book, I was sadly dissapointed to see that it totally changed the plot around. --- In the book, the 5 men bonded together and were great men of character. In the movie, they got rid of one man, had the other eaten right off the bat, Pencroft is shown to be a coward and greedy. In the book, Nemo appears only in the last two or three chapters, and he does not have an elaborate home on the island. --- And what about those stupid giant animals? I don't recall reading about them. The fence around Nemo's home looks like it came right from Jurassic Park. ---  --- The whole story was about 5 (eventually 6) men who were stranded on an uncharted island and the wonderful adventures they had there.  ---  --- On another note, the graphics were pretty bad. The panning was very blurry and the picture was often grainy. ---  --- As one reviewer well said, it is suitable for children who are easily pleased, but it is nothing like the book. ---  --- Perhaps this is why Amazon sells it for only $6.99
You may as well pitch the instructions because they're worthless (and the only reason I'm not giving a 5-star rating for the ADS Tech Video Xpress).  I was about ready to pitch the product as well, after losing two evenings trying to figure out how to get it to work.  Ultimately, I gave up on relying solely on the program it came with, and I instead opted to try it on my Windows Movie Maker.  Yahoo!  Perseverance paid off!  Once I switched to Movie Maker, this tool worked great!   ---  --- To date, I've converted about a dozen videos of content to computer files that I was able to burn to DVDs.  I just leave my Xpress hooked up to the back of my television so I don't have to try to remember later how to hook it up again.  Doing that, I can connect my laptop to the Xpress and start the video converting process within 3-4 minutes.  My Movie Maker program takes over the entire process.   ---  --- The ADS Tech Video Xpress has been especially useful for me because I teach a college telecourse and often show edited video clips to my students.  Before purchasing Xpress, I had crudely edited videos that I was reluctant to use; my videos had lots of amateur stop/start points.  Using Movie Maker with Xpress, I was able to download these videos to my laptop, then easily edit them so transitions between stop and start points became smooth and seamless.   ---  --- Pretty cool.  I'm glad I took a chance on this product! ---  --- Below are hook-up and program instructions I've written to myself for easy reference later.  Hopefully they'll be of more help to you than the instructions that come with this product: ---  --- First, hook up the Video Xpress equipment as follows: --- 1.  S-cable (buy one, since it doesn't come with the VideoXpress) goes from the back of your television to the VideoXpress.   --- 2.  Use red/white/yellow cords running into the back of the VCR/DVD that is hooked up to your televion as follows: --- - all three plug into the "video out" column --- - all three plug into the VideoXpress tool at the other end.   --- 3.  The USB plug for the VideoXpress tool plugs into the back of the computer. ---  --- Next, open the Instant Video Xpress program and verify the settings are as follows: --- - "NTSC M" for the video standard setting --- - "640 x 480" and "60 FPS (VGA)" for video format --- - "DVD, VCR, TV" for video source --- - "Video composite" for video input ---  --- Under the program advanced settings: --- - Low motion (TV, VCD, DVD) --- - CPU support: "SSE3" --- - Stereo system: "MTS" --- - Video decoder: "video standard: NTSC_M" ---  --- Under properties within the program advanced settings: --- - Stream format:  Video format: "NTSC_M" --- - Frame rate: "59.940" --- - Color space/compression: "YUY2" --- - Outputs size: "640x480" ---  --- Finally, CLOSE the Instant Video Xpress program.  (Windows Movie Maker can't access the video until this program is closed.  And yes, it's silly to have to open it, make those setting changes, then close it, but Video Xpress won't work correctly unless you follow those setting steps.) ---  --- In case you need this information for Windows Movie Maker, the steps (in order) are as follows: --- Under "File," click on "capture video." ---  --- Use the following settings: --- - audio device set at: "USB2.0 Analog Audio Device" --- - Video input source set at: "Composite" --- Under Configure Video Capture Device: --- - Video format: Video standard: "NTSC_M" ---      Frame rate: "29.970" ---      Color space/compression: "YUY2" ---      Output size: "640x480" ---  --- Under Camera settings: --- - Deinterlace method: "Low motion (TV, VCD, DVD)" --- - CPU support: "SSE3" --- - Stereosystem: "MTS" ---  --- Under Video decoder: Video standard: "MTSC_M" --- Signal detected: "1" --- Lines detected: "525" --- Then... ---  --- Give the file a name and indicate where to save it ---  --- Set it for "best quality" for playback. ---  --- Then "Start Capture." ---  --- If the Video Xpress is hooked up and running correctly, you should see on your computer monitor the video image of whatever is showing on television, but you will NOT hear the sound.  When you finish capturing and play it back, THEN you'll hear the sound. ---  --- I know, I know -- clear as mud.  But hey, it's better than the Xpress instructions!  :-
I would reccomend this film to any Robert Johnson fan as well as to anyone just getting into the blues who wants to know where its really at. It includes some great interviews with Johnny Shines, Robert jr Lockwood and others who knew Robert. Its worth it just to hear Lockwood play an unrecorded song of R.J.'s! The parts where Keb' Mo' re-enacts segments from R.J.'s life are well done and effectively illustrate what life would have been like back then for a traveling bluesman. My only criticism would be that there are few extra DVD features,however, that doesn't stop me watching this film again and again! A very informative insight into the life of one of the greatest Delta bluesmen
We bought this product based on its testimonials and thought it would be the best choice for our new baby. While he had no problems using the Playtex Nursers, he ended up having a problem with Dr. brown's Natural Flow bottles. First off, they are a pain to clean. Each piece needs to be painstakenly washed (boiling the nipple, washing the bottle, and scrubbing each hole of the the insert and the reservoir.) It was certainly laborsome and time consuming. Anyhow, when he uses them, he spits up where he didn't with the competition. I tried to figure out why. If you tip the bottle over it drips constantly without any sucking. So my baby is not sucking or swallowing when he uses this product. He lets it build up in his mouth and then ends up having to push it out when he has gotten too much. Needless to say, we are planning to return these and will stick with Playtex
These binoculars provide a good tool for night time --- sky viewing.  Easier to carry than a telescope with --- the advantage of using both eyes.  The tripod mount --- can be used with most any tripod with a standard screw mount. --- The 15 power makes hand holding a challenge but with practice --- they work great.
Although the compartments seem small, you can fit lots of food into this bowl. It's divided into about 4 or 5 sections, so you can separate your veggies, meat, etc. The only thing that bummed me out was the ice pack - the frozen gel expanded on the inside and caused the container to break :( So, I use it to store food in the fridge. I have all of the other Fit & Fresh containers and none of the ice packs on those have broken.
They don't make films like this today.  It's a scathing, smart, funny, and thought-provoking look at TV news.  But more importantly, it's a great film about complicated people and their relationships
Judas Preist's 1974 debut album. ---  ---  --- This is simpley weird, i could see why the band hates this album so much...simpley becuase it is so uneven and utterly sloppy and the production sounds like they recorded it in BFI dumpster. When i first got this, i was like "What the Hell?", granted, debut albums are far from perfect, but this was just downright miserable. This sounds like a combination of Pink Floyd,Rush,Black Sabbath and Cream on an acid trip. The song ROCKA ROLLA was OK and so was ONE FOR THE ROAD, but the rest of the material was abismal. SAD WINGS OF DESTINY was such an improvment from this mess! The coolest thing about this album is the weird scrapping guitar effects Tipton makes on one of the songs! I'm surprised that this was even issued on a CD, the band doesn't even acknowlege the existance of this album and i can see why! Fortuanatly they prooved to be so much more then what this platter of stange noises provided us with. I know that there are some that like this, but not me! It is very blues based in some songs, and the most annoying thing is that some of these numbers will put you to sleep. Any one expecting a rocking metal album from the Preist will be let down by this
Thinking this jacket was made of fleece like material, i ordered it thinking it was a good buy. When i got it in the mail, a week later, i was soooooooooo disappointed. The material is like paper/ potato sack material... Its awful.. Like plastic...  I dont recommend u waste [...] on this .. The jacket is stylish no doubt... but the material not something u'd actually wear.. So a stylish jacket with bad material describes this jacket best. [...
When I found out Francis Collins has written a book about his faith, I ordered it the same day.  After all, we seemed to be following the same path.  I earned a PhD in Molecular Biology in 1981 and had several `firsts' in the area of gene cloning.  Then I found Christ as a 40-year-old.  My transition was from a semi-serious Jew to a Materialist to a serious Christian.  Hearing about Dr. Collins' spiritual walk had me intrigued. ---  --- His book should be entitled "a Politician Presents Evidence for Belief".  It is a completely uncritical view of the last twenty years of biological research.  The Human Genome Project is elevated to status of "bridge to a momentous new era".  Hogwash.  Hype is the term I would use.  The Dept. of Energy was duped into footing the bill because the National Institutes of Health saw it as a waste of resources.  The author couldn't make a better case for the payoff than to show humans have more `junk DNA' than previously thought. ---  --- Dr. Collins then explained Darwinian gradualism as if it were dogma.  This oversimplification is typical of those who never studied Biology except at a Medical School.  This is not entirely his fault, however, since many scientific journals will not publish research where evolution isn't perfectly gradual and perfectly random.  Their motivation should be perfectly obvious, but it's not even on Dr. Collins' radar.  He also uses Mendel's peas as a pivotal point in our understanding of genetics, assuming the reader would be ignorant that Mendel's data was `dry-labbed'. ---  --- Usually an author who writes on this subject is strong in either Biology or Theology.  Dr. Collins relies on two sources for his treatise on Theology: St. Augustine and  C.S. Lewis.  I happen to agree with him that the Creation Story and the books of Job and Song of Solomon have a "lyrical and allegorical flavor".  I would include the Book of Jonah in that category as well.  However, there is an entire literature on the subject that is completely overlooked. ---  --- The only time Dr. Collins makes a strong case for anything, it is to refute Edward O Wilson, Richard Dawkins, and their minions.  Even then, he uses a quote from the late Stephen Jay Gould for his most scathing criticism.  Francis Collins is the consummate politician--he takes a stand without offending anyone.   ---  --- Dr. Collins knows that Jesus was not a politician, and He did not worry about offending the intellectual elites of his time. Take this quote from Mat 23:14 "Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation."  Dr. Collins' book claims to be a middle ground for theists and scientists.  In my opinion it is a  piece of fluff and a narcissistic retelling of the Human Genome Project myth.
i doubt i could have made it through the first three months without this product.  my daughter had undiagnosed acid reflux and this was recommended as a help.  (after she was diagnosed, we were given zantac... but still used this as well!)  it's a true godsend.  we'd add a dropperful to her formula and presto - she was content!!!  this works far better than mylicon.  it is expensive - but it is completely worth the price.  we called it 'liquid gold' in our house
Installed this on my 2006 Civic EX Sedan to replace the pathetic (meep...meep!) sounding factory horn. The factory horn made me shrink in embarassment everytime I used it. Well, no more - this Bad Boy made the receiving end to shrink now...lol.
Why doesn't Amazon allow people to sell *used* lettuce? I bought "To Kill a Mockingbird" used last week via amazon and saved about 90% off the original price. I don't think it's fair that they are not allowing us to sell it used via Paypal.
This is my third child and third infant car seat.  This was the most expensive, but worth the money.  The padding keeps the baby's head from that scary 90 degree flop; the shoulder straps have padding which prevents the red marks the others left on my kids; the straps don't get twisted and it's much easier to get in and out of the car.  It's the same weight as the others (which is to say rather heavy and awkward to carry).  The only thing I don't like is it does not fit on shopping carts.  Worth the money
LOVE these!  These are a great treat at any age.  I bagged the giant cola bottles, giant crocs and gummy bears in a treat bag for my 4th grade students.  They were savoring the giant cola bottles.  I don't blame them.  I find myself chomping on them, too.  I don't even like coca cola
the middle back pocket broke within the first week we used the item. and were unable to fix the problem
These individually wrapped Slim Jims make great snacks for hungry kids.  Toss a few in your purse and you have a portable, filling treat while you're out with the kids.  My kids love them and ask for them over fruit snacks or candy
I wasn't pleased with this book. I've read all of Ms. Warren's E-Books and I have to say they have a lot more fire. She lost a lot in this book.  Somewhere around the middle of the book, I started thinking "Did I actually buy a book this bad."  --- Because I enjoyed her e books so much I didn't stop to think before purchasing it. I was so happy to have her book, I immediately called a friend who also drove to the book store to purchase the book.  Boy, Did I get it from her the next day.  --- Because we don't believe in throwing money away, We're still stuggling to finish the book. Hopefully, there is light at the end of the tunnel.
I guess I understand why this movie was so savagely criticized during it's year of release, 1986.  Prince was still enjoying huge popularity based largely on the success of "Purple Rain," both the film and the soundtrack.  And critics love to knock someone off a pedestal, which is what they did to Prince in those days.  Many claimed that the movie was nothing more than an ego trip.  They couldn't believe Prince had the nerve to fire the director and then assume that role himself.  It was all way too harsh criticism for a movie that isn't trying to be anything more than a fun romantic comedy.  ---  --- Of course, poor critical response alone doesn't usually keep the public from making a movie popular.  Yet "Under the Cherry Moon" was a bomb at he box office.  Probably the main reason for this is that the movie, although shot in color, was released in black-and-white.  For some unfathomable reason, the general movie-going public is more often than not horrified at the prospect of seeing a black-and-white movie.  Now don't get me wrong, I'm not claiming that had the movie been released in color that people would have flocked to it in droves.  I'm only saying that it would have attracted more of an audience if it had been in color.  I will acknowledge that this movie's target audience is Prince fans.  Since I am one myself, and have been most of my life, I'm not the most entirely objective viewer. ---  --- But I make no apologies for my love of this movie.  It's not a "guilty pleasure" for me, because I proudly hold this as one of my favorites.  I had only seen it a couple times before the DVD release - and unfotunately I missed it in theaters (I couldn't get anyone to take me, I was only 12 and none of my friends were into P and certainly not my parents - though my dad went with me a few years later to see "Grafitti Bridge" on opening night, but that's for another review).  But since it's DVD release in 2004, this has become one of my most-watched discs in my collection. ---  --- The soundtrack is KILLER, the tunes make up one of the best Prince albums ever.  There's even some great stuff heard in the movie that didn't make the album (some of which was issued on 12" vinyl).  Plus, I think the movie looks great - the cinematographer was Michael Ballhaus, who has multiple Academy Award nominations to his credit (and was the DP on numerous Martin Scorsese classics).  I wonder how the movie would feel in color, but I do think black-and-white was the right way to go.  Even though the movie is set in then-contemporary times, it has the feel of something from the '30s.   ---  --- There are so many classic moments in this movie, I won't try to list them all.  But here are a few... Christopher Tracy (Prince) giving his "Bela Lugosi eyes"...Tricky (Jerome Benton) tossing rose petals into the tub while Christopher takes a bath...Christopher freaking out when he sees bats at the eatery...the "Wreka Stow" scene...the car race between Christopher and Mary Sharon (Kristen Scott Thomas). ---  --- As for the acting, I've heard a lot of people saying that Prince's performance was no good.  I don't see much truth in that claim.  After being so serious in "Purple Rain," it was a nice contrast to see him so loose and funny in this.  Jerome Benton proved he could do just fine even without Morris Day at his side (as in "Purple Rain") - I'm surprised Jerome hasn't done much additional acting outside of Prince movies.  And obviously Kristen Scott Thomas moved on from this, her first major role, to become an Oscar-nominated, highly repected leading lady.   ---  --- How is the DVD presentation?  Pretty good, for such a largely overlooked movie.  The widescreen transfer and 2.0 stereo mix aren't anything phenomenal, but get the job done nonetheless; the movie looks and sounds fine.  As for features, anyone expecting a full-blown Special Edition like the 2-disc "Purple Rain" will be disappointed.  But at least it's not a completely bare-bones release - four music videos are included, though unfortunately not presented in optimal audio/visual quality (though they are passable, I would've preferred 5.1 mixes).  The highlight is the live performance of "anotherlover" which was taken from a never-released (at least not domestically, not sure if it saw the light of day anywhere outside the U.S.) concert video documenting the Parade tour.   ---  --- MTV held an interesting (i.e.- very weird) contest to determine where "Under the Cherry Moon" would have it's world premiere.  The ten-thousandth caller to an MTV hotline would accompany Prince to the premiere, which would be held in their hometown.  MTV ran a special that covered the premiere party - and unlike the premiere of "Purple Rain" unfortunately this program is not to be found on "Under the Cherry Moon"'s DVD release.  Lisa Barber was the contest winner, and the movie did indeed premiere in her hometown of Sheridan, Wyoming - a very unusual place for a big movie to premiere.  When asked what he thought of the town of Sheridan, Prince summed it up with a single word: "Purple."
I have used these for years, and when I run out, my skin knows and shows the difference.  I have super sensitive skin that tends to become red and itchy when exposed to any kind of change in weather....cold or hot.  I carry these in my purse, and have them stashed all over the house....misting my face many times a day....voila....clear and moisterized skin!  They really do work wonders on sensitive facial skin, and they keep mine from being red and itchy, which makes me very happy
Keeping this smoker up to temperature had been a chore until I invested in a heavy duty 25 foot extension cord. I bought a 12 gage  15 amp 25 foot chord and I'm now actually using the thermostat to back off the temperature. ---  --- I got this cord at Lowes and it cost around $18 dollars. The manual  says to use a 50 foot or less cord with your smoker..but it makes sense to use as short of a cord as you can. ---  --- Also..thanks for the tip from a previous reviewer about drilling a hole at the bottom of the smoker to allow the excess water to drain out.   ---  --- Got to go my Ribs are almost done.   
You win some and you lose some. This purchase was a definite loss. What a dissapointment
I was really impressed by the taste of this cereal. I was expecting the flavor to be like cardboard or something like this, but instead it was really good. It was sweet (but not sugar sweet) and crunchy. I'll definitely buy this again. If the price went down I'd buy it more
I'm very pleased with this tea.   ---  --- I boil a pot of water and then take the lid off and let it cool to the right temperature, which is around 200 degrees Fahrenheit.  I let it steep for about five minutes and then remove my infuser and pour myself a cuppa nice, light oolong.  It's good and relaxing. ---  --- Arrived in the container seen in the picture, with the tea sealed up in a little plastic bag inside of it.  I'd recommend it
I'm very disappointed with this shredder. I got it back in October 2006, and I have only used it about 3 or 4 times.  First of all, although the product is supposed to shred up to 5 sheets at a time - IT DOES NOT. It will get jammed, so I only shred 1 or 2 sheets at a time. Tonight I used it again, and it became completely jammed from a few sheets. I cannot get it to work again.  It is very loud and a bit slow, but I can live with that, I just don't like the fact that it jams after only using it a few times. I recommend others spend a few extra dollars and get a reliable shredder, unlike the Royal "5-sheet" Crosscut Shredder HT500x
This game is really great. I would recommend this game to anyone. It's a great game to play with the family or by yourself. I have had this game for awhile now and have finished it about 2 times. The first time i've finished it, it was kinda challenging on the last level, but when I went over it again I zipped right threw it. This game doesn't get you bored at all you'll be into it right from the beginning of the game. I like how you can choose whoever you want during the game. The graphics well they aren't as great as the movie. But overall it's awesome. I will play it over and over again. It's great!!!!!!!!!!!
When I first got this watch I was thrilled.  It has a nice movement and has very powerful illumination.  The problem started when I went to the store to get the bracelet sized for my puny wrists.  The guy asked me if this was some kind of overstock or gray market, because the pins in the bracelet popped out like nothing.  At the time I thought he was just po'd because I didnt buy the watch at the store.  As soon as I was home though the bracelet fell apart.  What a piece of junk!  I regret buying this watch and I advise against it. 
This game is so much fun!!! I do think that maybe it could use a few more games or maybe make different difficulty levels. In other words... If you are a huge Star Wars fan like me, then you will love this game!!! It will keep you occupied for at least an hour a day if you are determined to beat a certain level. Another thing I think it could use is maybe a game-save function or something... Anyway, GREAT GAMING EXPERIENCE!!! One and a half thumbs up!!!
I didn't see the other reviews until after my copy arrived. Having now wasted a weekend reading this book, I have to agree with everyone. The topic sounds great, the book isn't
I just bought my first laptop computer and really, really hated the touchpad. I found it unresponsive at times and found the whole right clicking and using the pad at the same time a pain. ---  --- I spent a while browsing the different mice available on this and other sites and in the end decided upon this little number. ---  --- I am very happy that I did too. Its pretty small and very lightweight but at the same time it doesnt feel at all fragile - definately well made. Im about 5'11 and have fairly big hands - I find this mouse comfortable to use. It looks pretty cool too, the red panels on the side light up, which is always good for night work. All the buttons are very responsive and that middle button is a godsend after using the touchpad for the past month. I couldnt ask for better all round performance. And for $20 you really cant go wrong, it really is a great price for a microsoft mouse. The only reason I dont give it five stars?? Well this is technology - although it is a awesome piece of kit, there are always other things or features they could have added
This album is a real let down and it pains me to say so, since I really do like the KOL. The first 2 cds were catchy and they rocked. I didn't care if they were singing about groupie sex or street brawling. It didn't matter because the songs were great.But on this cd they've opted for an experimental sound that doesn't measure up. Innovative is one thing but that shrill screech in Charmer-what the heck is up with that? How often do you want to listen to it? Once was enough for me. I wasn't expecting the Pixies here. And then there's the reverb employed on song after song-why? It just degenerates into white noise. There are a couple of good tracks on the dics- Black Thumbnail, for one. But then there are throwaway tunes like Camaro, which is about as clique as you can get. That said, art is subjective, and there are obviously plenty of folks who feel compelled to give this cd glowing reviews. But I find most of it unlistenable.I can think of many cds that merit a 5 star rating; this is definitely not one of them
The product came promptly and I am happy with the quality.  However fitment wasn't perfect as the ends would sit a little higher than my treo.  Not a huge problem, but something I would feel everytime I reach for the stylus. But the pen works pretty good, and it feels sturdy in my hands.  I would definately recomment this product to others
I finally found out this was out on DVD after having the VHS version for many years.  The DVD edit is very close to the VHS version minus the glitch during the scorpions opening act, plus some video strobing added during Cindy Lauper's run down the runway, which I'm not sure was really needed, but I'm ok with it, although the video strobing was done again later, which seems to me as a cheap effect, that really doesn't add to the performance. ---  --- I think Brian Adams and Cindy was excellent for the parts they portraid.  I thought originally sinaed (sp? whatever) was a strange choice at the time, maybe good for the part, but after seeing the documentary, I see her being a good intention decision at the time that ended up biting them in the end.  She's too instable, and apparently did not realize the importance of such an event, nor did she show any respect for the part.  Speaking of which, all of those artists that were called to perform at this event, and didn't say Yes on the first call.... shame on you.  If Roger calls you for an event, you say YES, and put whatever you're doing aside, because this was way too big of an event to try to be politically correct with. ---  --- I wish there were more documentary material with this DVD, as this was such a big event, there should have been more information.  I had heard in an interview before the show that Roger was once asked if he'd ever do the wall again, and he basically said "If the berlin wall would ever come down, then I would consider doing it again", and this was never mentioned in the Doc. ---  --- Buy the video, even if you have the VHS, you'll enjoy it. ---  --- ... Still waiting for Pulse to be released as well, enjoy!
This movie certainly had some strong actors and actresses in it and that with an interesting storyline landed it on my viewing list. ---  --- Overall, I was somewhat disappointed with this film.  I figured there would be a little more real suspense or "thrill" but it never materialized and instead just followed many of the usual plot events.  The biggest failure was the completely unneccessary cheesey romance between Eastwood and Russo. It was contrived, lame, and almost laughable. I had to rub my eyes to make sure I wasnt having a nightmare! ---  --- John Malkovich does a great job as the wackjob and is totally convincing in this role.  Unfortunately the script didnt do him enough justice and even his character did some staple moves.  Clint Eastwood was great as always but he did play his usual self. No problem here though, Clint was solid. ---  --- The film just fizzled as it went along and it started to get tiresome towards the very end.  The climax was rather anti-climactic except for the shooting scene which was kind of cool although I saw it coming a mile away.  There was not as much suspense as I was hoping for and the "thrill" was mostly missing. ---  --- What else can I say, watch it and make your own decision but overall I was not that impressed and the film let me down a bit after such glowing reviews
I bought the entire line of products from the Lisa's Hair Regimen on the Carol's daughter website. I took all the products back to Sephora yesterday. I used this Hair oil on my scalp and the next day my scalp started itching. I washed it that night and woke up the next morning in serious pain. I wear my hair natural and I had what felt like chemical burns all over my scalp. When I took the product back to Sephora the lady who sold it to me told me my scalp was RED w/ white spots all throughout it. I had to take OTC pain medication twice a day for three days just to help me sleep at night due to the pain. The only thing I can attribute it to is an allergic reaction. The product contain extracts from different types of plant and flowers. If you have allergies to these items I would suggest not using this product. I contacted Carol's Daughter and have not heard back from them yet. I would have expected more from the company who's product states 'Made with Love, Peace'.
I usually don't do album reviews but I gotta say this was tight from beginning to end and I was shook that this was given a low reading by a magazine I call "The Sauce" So many of yall need to stop reading magazine ratings and come to sites likes this and read your own peers ratings.  Word of mouth is bliss. A-G-2-A-KE who came out on Rap-A-Lot hasn't come out with a cd since this classic.  I'm salty they didn't "make it" because this was heavily slept on
My hsuband and and decided that I would nurse Hailey her entire first year.  I work at a school and was able to pump twice a day.  I didn't like doing it in school though because there wasn't space for it.  SO I would go in my car and do it.  All I had a first was the battery pack.  I would go through 10 batteries a week and half way through the week I would loose strength/suction. ---  --- Once I got the adapter I never had a problem again.  We could go anywhere and I would always have access to power Including when we drove from VA to GA.  My husband would drive and I would pump.  It is great..
I bought this model 7 years ago for over $100 and it is still running strong although I only use it to clip a small family dog.  Nevertheless, forget the cheap vibrating 'magnetic motor' clippers - not enough power and the buzzing bothers the animal.  This clipper uses a superior rotating motor that is more powerful and provides a consistent cutting action.  In fact, with the right (replaceable) blade, you could use this to cut kids hair as well.  It stays cool, unlike the magnetic motor design.  Use with Oster Kool Lube and you  will never have problems getting a clean cut.  It uses blades by Oster so there is a lot of versatility possible
I got this for my wife to use in the kitchen and she loves it.  The unit is beautifully designed, fun to use and has amazing sound for something so small.  My only gripe is that the tuner is not very strong.  I live in a tough area for reception, and there's slight static on my favorite stations.  The FM antenna attachment that comes with the unit helps quite a bit, but the reception is still not totally clear. ---  --- That being said, I'm glad I got it, and when my wife's happy, I'm happy
Very unreliable .......... I have used DVD RW and CD RW Memorex disks on multiple computers and DVD recorders.  I find that they.....1) don't last....get about 50 re-recordings NOT 1500  2) may crap out on any occasion.......multiple CD RW's with critical material would NOT read on multiple computers. ---  --- AVOID MEMOREX DVD RW &  CD RW DISKS!
It does everything promised but takes several hours of going over the instructions to figure out how to program some of the features.  Instructions hard to locate in booklet
The magazine has great, quality pictures and some interesting articles.   ---  --- The pictures of some golf courses are amazing and very professional. ---  --- I love reading this magazine in my spare time.  Yes, the magazine is for golfers who always tended to have higher incomes.  Golf  was always an expensive sport anyway. ---  --- For golf instructions, I recommmend                          THE ULIMATE GOLF INSTRUCTION GUIDE: KEY TECHNIQUES FOR BECOMING A ZERO HANDICAP GOLFER OR BETTER.  This is written by Patrick Leonardi ---  --- I wanted to share with other readers because this book made my golf game get much better.  If you are like me, I was stuck around the same handicap.  However, this book got me playing much better golf. ---  --- For golf equipment, I definitely recommmend PING IRONS.  Great feel and distance with these clubs.  For putters, I also recommend PING.  They are the best.  The ball putts straight and true.   The feel is natural and unforced.
I used Aveeno moisturizer and thought I would try something new.  I have eczema on my face (around my eyes, nose and mouth) in the winter and have no signs of it after a few days.  My skin is very sensitive, and have experienced burning with other products, but not this one.  I sinks in quickly and is not greasy feeling or heavy, yet strong enough to tackle dry skin.  I highly recommend it
I just bought this game and tried for 3 hours to make it work on 3 different t.v. sets - NO LUCK.  I can't even give it 1 star because I don't know how fun it is (or might be).  I tried every "input" available on every t.v., I tried changing the batteries, I tried hooking it directly to the t.v. as well as thru the VCR and DVD player - nothing worked.  I guess I know why it only cost $5.99.
I so love the size and shape of this camera. This one takes some good pictures, and appear to be quite clear. It's better than the integrated camera on my cell phone. This camera may seem like it's taken a poor quality image, but when you transfer them onto a pc, they seem so clear! However it is recommended that you get a memory card for this camera as it only has 14mb of internal memory. As this camera was a gift to me, I'd have to say it was the best birthday present I have received
I din't love these at all.  The flavor combinations struck me as off, there was no improvement in the pistachio taste by adding harissa. Also the texture was unpleasant, somewhat soggy.  I like the healthy aspect, but if you aren't enjoying the experience why eat at all
   --- Is there anything more American then apple pie, baseball or a good Rock Hudson/Doris Day Film? It's always been such a treat to curl up with them and the third essential player, Tony Randall. Rock is always doing something to infuriate Doris. He's her worst nightmare. And what's more, he pretends to be someone else that Doris falls for head over heals until the gig is up. Then she's out for revenge, but love always wins out. Ahhhh such feel good, laugh out loud stuff. ---   --- So in this one from 1961 "Lover Come Back", Madison Ave is the setting. Advertising is the game of Carol Templeton and rival Jerry Webster. But Jerry is such a cad and a playboy. He steals big clients right from under her by wining and dining them, throwing raucous parties and getting the girl for them. Carol on the other hand, does things a little different. She's virtuous and business like. When he trumps her cards once too often, she plans to get a little underhanded herself. Trying to win over the scientist that is going to invent a new product for our guy Rock, Doris, who has never met Webster(as is always the case), mistakes him for...you guessed it..the shy, retiring, needy nerdy scientist. Jerry, in true form goes along with it, and tries to woo Carol into his bed. And the fun continues... ---   --- Doris is marvelous. Watch her face. So many different emotions she goes through. From being Exasperated, to being in love, she does it all. She's simply a joy. Rock matches her perfectly with his pretenses, and has a way with the dialogue that just says Rock!  As mentioned Tony Randall is always the third part to the equation that makes these films such classic fun. Here he is the President of the ad firm and Jerry's boss, but hasn't a clue as to what's going on. He does this quite well.Meanwhile, the fun doesn't end with Doris and Rock. The race to make a new product, VIP! is causing quite a few explosions and when the product is finally ready for testing...well you just have to see for yourself! ---  --- The rest of the cast is quite a roll call. Ann B Davis, Delbert Mann, Donna Douglas(the beautiful Ellie Mae Clampett), Edie Adams, Jack Albertson, Jack Oakie, Joe Flynn, Richard Deacon,wow... the list goes on. --- The transfer to DVD looks great. Picture clear, colors good.The film is presented in Anamorphic widescreen 1.85:1 The sound is in Dol Dig 2.0(MONO), but this isn't an action flick, so it's fine.There are caption in English(a nod to Universal there), subtitles in Spanish and French. There are no features of any kind other than scene selections. ---  --- This film is a treasure from the 60's vault. Doris' outfits alone are smashing, and NYC in the 60's too. This film has no rating on the case, but I would say PG. There are some adult situations, but all done in tasteful fun(can you imagine Doris Day, doing anything else, even if she tried?).The other two films that this trio delight us with is "Pillow Talk" and "Send Me No Flowers" ---  --- Well, I'm off to watch another Day/Hudson/Randall film. I've got my bowl of VIP and ready for a fun evening.....Lauri
My son loves this game! We rented it first from Blockbuster and now he won't let us take it back, so I ordered it from Amazon.com so I can take the game back soon to Blockbuster! I have to help him through some of the areas, like when the penguin is fishing, but I don't mind because it's FUN
I explected the microdermabrasion head to rotate, but instead it vibrates very strongly in your hand.  My hands are still buzzing from the night before when I used this product. ---  --- I would not recommend this product to anyone else, I loved the crystals cream.
It arrived in 3 days and I used it for a week, and I still get some stray ingrowns once in a while but it is the only thing that worked this good this fast for me and trust me I tried everything in the book. ---  --- A plus is my face is one even complexion when I had alot of dark spots which was a pleasant surprise
 --- I've spent all day putting together a 300 page book in Corel Draw, the file was saved several times without error, the finished piece is 2.6 GB. I exported it as a PDF that is 4.5 GB. Never any errors in Corel Draw.  ---  --- Acrobat won't open the PDF. Says it's corrupted. ---  --- Now when I open the CDR all I get is a single page, and when I right click on the file and look at the properties it says it's 0 pages. ---  --- I'm really upset, and now I've wasted an entire day with COREL's software, if the thing is just for 1 or 2 page church brochures COREL should WARN people on the package. ---  --- It looks like I'm SOL and I'm guessing Corel will never bother with a reply. ---  --- Hint: I think I'll switch to Adobe. ---  --- Sincerely, ---  --- Waitman Gobbl
I was required to purchase this with my new computer. I thought I'd give it a chance at work. We have a dedicated wired network, which just requires that you register the machine's MAC address with our DHCP server. Nice and simple, and very much like the LAN in any home where the user has a NAT router. ---  --- I plugged in the network and tried to get the MAC address. Vista would only give me the wizard to connect my network. OK, I tried the wizard. It offers to let me setup PPPoE with a username and password. That's it, no other options. I asked for other options, and it only offered that I use a modem (that I did not have in my computer.) No options for a dedicated network at all, that I could find. ---  --- I went to another machine (on the 'net) and searched Google. None of the Microsoft sites were helpful in any way. Lots of PR posturing, but no useful information or troubleshooting. ---  --- I gave up, found the license and install disks for Windows XP, and downgraded the new machine. It was far, far easier.
I recieved the headphones this week and hooked them up to my fast tracker and went out into the yard looking for treasure. They work great and I was very pleased with the quality of the product and the sound.If you have a fast track metal detector you need to purchase this accessory it is made to adapt to all bounty fast track models.  The Vinma
The markers are dark and clearly visible, while the eraser is fairly thorough. The box comes with a plastic-molded container (as you see in the picture), with double-sided tape for easy, stable, mounting on a wall beside the whiteboard. For the low price, this is unbeatable
Some products lead to real improvement of your skin (retin A, exfoliators) while others simply cover up the imperfections acting like a make up. The sad and hillarious thing is that most consumers mix up makeup effects with real skin improvement. ---  --- The Regenerist contains SILICONES that fill in small wrinkles and mattify the skin surface thus acting like an invisible makeup. Such effects lead most consumers to believe their crow's feet are smaller. If you really want to do a test, you should stop using the product for a few days using only face wash. If during that time you observe smaller wrinkles then the product works. You can't really claim the wrinkles are smaller while the product is on your face covering them hello.... --- And another thing, a wrinkle can't be erased in one or 3 weeks - the skin doesn't produce collagen that fast (unless you cut it). ---  --- Paying $18 / 1.7 oz (retail price, its cheaper on amazon but you have to pay shipping price) for a silicone makeup is a little steep for me provided that there are cheaper products on the market that will make your skin look equally good cause they contain the same silicone base even better -  try Monistat soothing care - chafing relief powder gel 1.5 OZ, $7 at CVS.  ---  --- I have been using Matrixyl(the active peptide in Regenerist) for 6 months in my own formulations (without silicones) and frankly speaking haven't noticed any improvement in my crows feet or the lines on my forehead. Currently there is only one study of the effects of Matrixyl conducted by Sederma - the MANIFACTURER of Matrixyl which makes me quite suspicious about the whole story ...
A quality product. Low to the ground so very hard for a little one to tip over. Easy to assemble. Can't wait for the snow to disappear so we can take it outside! Have been riding it inside, mostly using our legs (we're not yet 2 yrs old) to scoot around. However, our bigger cousin (just turned 5 yrs old) had a blast with it and could still peddle without grinding his knees into the handle bars. This trike will last a long time and thru many kids
There are so many reviews saying this is a true story I have to point out that while the war and the deployment were real (obviously), about everything else is dramatized (including the mission objectives: SCUD hunting on foot, which is a joke to anyone who knows how wars are fought today). McNab has essentially written Tom Clancy genre fiction. The book Bravo Two Zero differs in details with another book written by a second member of the patrol, Chris Ryan, called The One That Got Away. However, both are convincingly debunked by a third SAS memeber in a book called The Real Bravo Two Zero, also available on Amazon, though only the UK Amazon site (which you can still order from in the US). In it, an SAS member who can actually speak Arabic retraces the patrol using both books as guides and talks to all the people McNab and Ryan supposedly killed and gets their side of the story. Most importantly, he manages to restore, without a doubt, the reputation of Vince Phillips, blamed by Ryan for getting the patrol discovered by the Iraqis and a couple members eventually killed. Contrary to what you may expect, I would recommend seeing this, in fact I recommend getting and comparing all three books: B20, The One That Got Away, and The Real B20
I just read the other reviewer's comments.  Yes, the bag isn't huge, but it certainly gets the job done.  It's not the over-sized bag where you can stuff 6 full sized textbooks, but it's a bag that has style.  That's why I got it.  It's a bit more european in its design, and is of good quality.  I dont expect zippers to break anytime soon.  Look to be good quality.  Also, at this price--it is such a good deal
i first bought this product because the woman at the store said that it renewed the skin, bringing newer skin to the surface.  and she added that it helps pull pimples out to the surface so you can get rid of them easier, i was a little wary a first, but it works.  my skin feels softer and looks more even all around.
This one is excellent for the price. Good build and accurate.  --- I wish it had alert function
The item is so much cheaper than the alternative,which is $200.  It was easy to use and easy to store when not in use
You will probably be more productive and less bug ridden if you stick with what you have. --- 15 years of Outlook and you can't print a single address label or an envelope with one click. (or 10 clicks for that matter) --- There is no function to easily print out mailing labels either.  --- Lets remember Outlook is a Contact manager ... next to many other things...  ---  --- Maybe Outlook 2010 will be the answer. --- 
We've used this since our baby was born three months ago.  It has a the perfect combination of space for baby accessories as well as your own. It has two small external pockets for extra bottles and a large inside pouch where we keep most of the diapers and larger gear (as well as inside compartments). It also has a small cell phone pocket outside which we use.  The bag is excellent quality and not so large as to be awkward to carry around.  Our baby is still too small to use the convertible sling but I have seen it used on older children. ---  --- We'll be getting these as gifts for our friends who are expecting
I love this stuff!! Five months ago I was diagnosed with having AK's (Actinic Keratosis -- lesions that can develop into squamous cell carcinoma/ skin cancer). My dermatologist recommended I use Skinceuticals CE Ferulic every day as it prevents thymine dimers (DNA mutations associated with skin cancer) with a medium exfoliator for a few months before taking more drastic measures to eradicate the AK's. My skin has never been healthier!! The lesions (which were scaly, itchy, and red) are healed and the overall apperance of my skin has improved dramatically and is much more even. My pores are smaller and I have a healthy glow. The CE Ferulic also is packed with antioxidant protection to help fight free-radical damage and provides photoprotection.  --- HIGHLY recommended for those with AK's, uneven skin tone, large pores, or blemished or dull skin.  --- LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!
Doom 3 is scary. you literally spend most of the game in the dark and nightmarish creatures can come out of nowhere and try to kill you. The environments look great and so does the character models. The game is long but can be longer if you get lost. However, this game has a few flaws. One (and it's a big one) is that you have to always carry the flashlight around. because most FPS only have the character have one weapon on one hand at a time and have the other hand to be non-existent, you constently have to switch between the flashlight and a weapon. So when it's dark and you have to fight, you have to either hold a flashlight and keep whacking your opponent until it's dead or stay in the dark and shoot your enemy which you can have a hard time finding it. the second con is that (unlike Half Life 2) you can't really interact with much. you can't grab certain objects and drop them or throw them. And a final con, which comes to one word: Imps. these are the most annoying enemy in the game. you constently fight them and it can get annoying sometimes. otherwise, a game to get
I after drooling over this watch for two years wishing I had one, I finally got one and have had my Advizor for two months now.  All I can say is that if I had known how cool this thing really was, I would have shelled out the $300 a long time ago. Each one of the features listed above does everything you could want. The Heart Rate Monitor has target zone settings, average workout heart rate, highest and lowest hear rate, and more. The Altimeter tells your rate of ascent, total vertical climb and stores all the data from recent workouts in memory. The coolest feature is that it will store your heart rate, altitude and rate of ascent/decent at intervals from 20 seconds to ten minutes so that after a workout you can scroll though and see how your heart rate was affected by altitude and acent rate. I got completely geeky with this information after one workout, and I typed it all into my computer so I could see what it looked like. The only drawback to the Advizor is that it gives you so much information, it would be great if you could download it directly to a computer for analysis. There is no PC link, so any analysis has to be done on the watch or typed in by hand. But other than that, this gizmo is perfect. No problems at all so far and I use the thing for two workouts a day.  I am a cross country ski racer and for a long time I had thought that this would be the perfect training aid for endurance athletes and now that I have tried it I know that it is
I hesitate to write a review about a food because, well, one man's meat is another man's poison ...  I like the not-too-sweet and minimally processed taste of this brand; the Banana flavour is our favourite.  The Fruit and Nut flavour lacks a little oomph and the fruit inside is too tangy for my taste buds (so maybe TOO minimally processed?).  Also, remember that 'All Natural' is NOT organic, even if you find this in the health food section of your grocery store.  Our local Target also carries this brand of granola and has the best price for it
I am a previous Britax owner. I purchased the Britax Roundabout for my daughter when she was 4 months. At 18 months she was only 5 inches from outgrowing it. Since we had such a plesant experience with the roundabout we decided to stay with the Britax brand and purchase the Marathon in the Olivia print. I was very dissapointed. --- I had a major issue with the straps comming loose while we were driving. When we would get to our destination the straps were so loose there was virtually nothing holding her into her seat. A huge scare for any parent at the thought of what could happen when you slam on your brakes. It also lacked the supurb comfort that britax boasts of. My daughter was never as comfortable in the marathon as she was in her roundabout. The rubber things that go over the straps were also incredibly annoying. The constantly slid down out of place and by the end of the trip the chest clip was in my childs lap. That coupled with the straps comming loose were defentially not expected of britax high saftey standards. I went through quite the fiaso returning this seat and after 3 returns I bought the Eddie Bauer seat instead. So far I have no complaints. I wouldn't waste my money on this. Buy the roundabout if you want Britax name, but please dont bother with this Marathon
I bought this dress for a trip I'm taking in one week. Should've known better. You get what you pay for, that's for sure. This dress arrived balled up in a USPS bag. It didn't look anything like the picture shown on this site, more like a slip, than a slip dress. And here's the kicker - it was RIPPED! Had two large "snags" on the back of the dress. I'm sending it back and they BETTER not try to charge me shipping. I'm PO'd to the max and who knows if I'll find a dress in time. Grrrr
didn't like these.  infact theyre so ugly i havent even tried them o
I'm glad someone knows enough about English History to recognize the pure fiction of this film.  But in addition to points made about historical inaccuracy, I also had to object to the ridiculous portrayal of Mary Tudor.  Over-zealous and fanatic (as was a common religious stance in those times - promoted by both sides of the Protestant/Catholic conflict), she was not insane as the film makes her in the opening scenes.  And throughout the film, there was this emphasis on milking the passions for all they are worth - no objectivity whatsoever.  I was sorely disappointed! ---  --- If you want to get to know Elizabeth and the period in which she lived, I would recommend the superb BBC series, Elizabeth R with Glenda Jackson.  And if you want even further background, look to the BBC again in the Six Wives of Henry VIII with Keith Mitchell.  Tidbits can be gained as well from the movie Mary, Queen of Scots (although a few historical inaccuracies can be found in it - for example, Mary Stuart and Elizabeth never met, although it was Mary's great desire) and even another title, Anne of the Thousand Days.  Those two more theatrical representations fulfill the desire for the more dramatic while still coming closer to the history of the times.  This film just doesn't cut it
I bought this camera just under 12 months ago and recently the battery cover door would not stay closed.  I sent it into Nikon along with my proof of purchase and about a week later got a letter saying it would not be covered under warranty. The repair charge with shipping and tax would be $115.22. ---  --- I am the only person that uses this camera and it was never dropped or abused.  Battery was only taken in and out maybe 4 or 6 times over the time I had it.  ---  --- For this reason I would never buy another Nikon product again.  Next digital camera will charge without removing battery.   ---  --- Camera takes GREAT pictures, but can't do business with a firm that is very difficult to get ahold of and does not honor their warranty.  ---  --- Bye Bye Nikon
Clinique's Bare Brilliance is one of my absolute favorite lipsticks ever! --- It has a fairly sheer finish with lovely little sparkles in it.  I have Berrylicious(sheer grape) and Cherry Quartz(sheer, true red--doesn't look like it does on the color swatch) and neither overwhelms my pale skin.  I wouldn't be caught dead without a Bare Brilliance lipstick in my makeup bag or purse!
Accurate, easy to program and good to look at.  Well worth the $ spent
This is a very nice sleek cover and gives your phone a great feel and look
I've been buying these freeze dried strawberries for several months and use them mainly in my cereal. They are delicious and consistantly high quality. I have only had one can with what seemed like excessive strawberry "powder" at the bottom.
This product is a good idea however: ---  --- 1. The fill hole, is not large enough to fill the bottom of the dish       ---    with hot tap water without getting water into the serving tray. ---  --- 2. Can't be put in the Micro. ---  --- 3. Extremely hard to open bottom compartment to clean. ---  --- 4. Extremely hard to open and close ( I and my daughter have to use a  ---    butter knife to pry open). ---  --- 5. Not good for a grandmother's hands that has joint problems. ---  --- 6. Doesn't keep food warm for very long. ---  --- Perhaps going back to the drawing board would help this product
If you want to see Lena Heady's breasts exposed, this is the film to watch.  But besides the numerous unnecessary topless scenes (which aren't too bad) this film is very intriguing...the human spirit tries to break through walls of addiction, frustration and isolation... now isn't that what a "suspense" drama should be about
We own a home with vaulted ceilings and we have tried everything to keep the house clean (cobwebs, ceiling fans, windows,etc.) that are out of reach.  We found this product online and it works great.  Our kids even enjoy using it around the house.  Each attachment is perfect for the task at hand.  I wish we bought it five years ago. 
Saveur is a celebration of authentic cuisine with everything from Food Festivals to very easy-to-make recipes, like Blueberry Pudding. While there are a few book reviews for foodies to enjoy, the writing introduces cooks to international flavors and seasonal fare. Restaurants are also a feature as are gourmet cooking essentials.  ---  --- While reading you may discover a pastry shop or start to dream of making a recipe like Chicken Fried Steak. Yes, this very gourmet book has comfort food recipes as well as more complex recipes like the one for Olive Bread which actually only requires a minimum of bread making skills.  ---  --- After reading this magazine I'm normally in the mood to drizzle olive oil over just about anything I'm putting in the oven. The recipe for Stuffed Tomatoes and Summer Squash had me wishing it was October again and the recipe for Fig Jam reminded me of my childhood in Africa where we had a Fig Tree in the backyard.  ---  --- Saveur is filled with nostalgia, entertaining food adventures and delicious recipes. With Amazon's Gourmet food section, we can now find the ingredients to make many of the recipes in this magazine.  ---  --- ~The Rebecca Review 
And I am not just talking about weight loss products.  I took one pill....ONE PILL!  Within a few minutes, I was curled up around the toilet crying because I needed to throw up so badly but I couldn't.  I hadn't drunk anything but one glass of water with it, and yet, I was peeing all day.  I was nauseus....my fiancee stayed home with me all day to take care of me.  I didn't want to move, but I would have to go to the bathroom to pee, and would carry around a trash can with me just in case I finally could throw up.  I would not wish these symptoms on ANYONE, not even my worst enemy.  That was probably the worst sickness I have ever had
Not only is "We Love Katamari" way better then the first, but you get to play the prince's cousins. Some of the cousins are faster, some are slower & some seem stronger then others. Also some of the Katamari's have earth elements such as a big snowball Katamari & a fireball one too. The fireball is kind of tricky, you have to keep the fire on it burning, if not the level fails, also watch out for the water, it will put it out, no matter how big it is. Last but not least to finish "We Love Katamari", you need to convert your progress from "Katamari Damacy" to this one. If you did delete the first one from you memory card, then to bad, you'll have to play the first all over again.    
Well this is marketed as a quick and healthy snack for kids, but I find it perfect for me.  It's a great charge of chocolate and not too many calories and bit of fiber, what more can you ask for
I have an original thighmaster I purchased years ago...thinking this Thighmaster Gold was going to be similar I purchased it to take to work with me.  It is very flimsy-it seems to be made of very light weight material that is not going to hold up. My old thighmaster is very sturdy-I have been using it for years and it looks fairly new.  This one will be ready for the trash can in less than a year.  Save your money
 the battery is half the side of the battery came with the camera an last half the time, an number or not the same ,an it,s not the same battery. do not buy any thing from them because lying about what they are selling
The Spy Who Came In From The Cold gets inside your veins like cold, bullying ice and by the end of the movie you feel numb.  Based on the famous novel by John Le Carre, director Martin Ritt seems determined to reveal the ugly reality of espionage (on both sides of the Iron Curtain) as it really was.   ---  --- Alec Leamas, the haunted British spy for the U.S. has nothing to do with James Bond.  Richard Burton gives such a phenomenal performance as this rancid, cranky, solitary alcoholic (he wasn't entirely acting) that one can't help but wonder why he didnt get the Oscar for Best Performance that year.  Leamas is, in his own words, "just a bloody man", tired of all the ideologies on both sides of the fence which lead to all the horrors and betrayals he has witnessed and been a full participant in.  His paradox is a painful one; rejecting "Karl Marx, God, and all the rest of it", he is also a man beginning to realize that his career in espionage is one of sheer immorality. ---  --- Claire Bloom's Nan Perry is the catalyst for the tragic and unforgettable ending of the film.  A young woman Leamas meets while he works in a London library awaiting his next assignment from the charming and bone-chilling head of operations in Britan, George Smiley, she is also an avowed Communist.  When things come to a head and she is dragged into the brutal world Leamas inhabits, he tries desperately to communicate that she is only "a frustrated little girl from a crackpot library".   ---  --- But the most heinous betrayal here is Leamas' skillful befriending and cold use of real Communist Oskar Werner.  Leamas pretends to defect from the British Agency and stages a brawl with a grocer to increase his appearance of discontent.  Werner is the to whom he discloses fictitious "secrets" about American espionage, all the while having cynical and hilarious dialogues with him about the whole situation. ---  --- At the end, with two victims of the dirty business he's involved himself in for some vague principle (protecting the "moronic masses"), Leamas cannot go on.  He is very much on the fence so to speak and ends up on the wrong one quite intentionally. A haunting, beautiful movie.   ---  ---   ---   --- 
My son was 7 lbs 1 oz when he was born and 20 inches long... He wasnt the tiniest baby... I tried putting him in the sling and it just looks like he's falling and being enveloped by this huge orange thing... It's the WORST product ever, I am definitely NOT using it and will probably donate it to goodwill..
I have owned this watch for over a month now and I can note the following: ---  --- The watch has a diameter of approximately 40mm and is around 10mm thick. Both these number seem average and it looks good on an average size wrist. ---  --- The watch is a bit heavy, but sits comfortably on the wrist. The bracelet rarely pulls the hair, although I have plenty of it. ---  --- The watch is easy to accumulate scratches, but not on the glass. I have scratched the steel around the glass (as well as other places), but the sapphire resists remarkably. ---  --- The time keeping is very accurate, compared to the atomic clock on the web. After a month it has advanced less than half a second ahead, which will result in a six second difference at most per year. I guess results may vary between different watches, but it seems nevertheless impressive and trustworthy enough. ---  --- The timer is very easy to start, stop and reset, with one button pushes. Very fast and convenient. ---  --- The alarm can barely be heard, so is not appropriate for waking. It is useful though for reminders, in a noise free location. Not difficult to set, but takes some time, comparable with setting an alarm on a cell phone. Since it is relative to the secondary time keeping mechanism, you can have a second time zone set and advance the alarm relative to that. ---  --- This watch does not seem to attract special attention to it and has not gained any comments so far, without me bringing it in a conversation. Is pretty conservative, but I personally like that. ---  --- The price of this watch in amazon seems to fluctuate between 100 and 140 dollars. If the price is higher than 130, I would wait a tad, but not hold my breath too long. It is definately worth the money though, since i have seen several Seiko watches like this one enter their 20 or 30 years of age and still continue strong. For a dependable, accurate, water proof watch for every occasion, most probably you cannot do better than this
My 15-month-old son pulled these off (and broke one) within about 5 minutes of installing them.  Also, he was able to turn the covers which ended up turning on the gas. ---  --- Bad design.  Don't waste your money
My 3 year old son loves this watch.  You can change all of the pieces of the band to different colors and different sizes.  It clicks on easily and doesn't come off -- even on a child's arm.  I am very happy with this watch
Russians and Yankees team up to save the world in "Meteor", one of the last gasps in the celebrity-disaster movies of the 1970s'.  (Like the "Airport" movies - you'd have a bunch of celebs tossed around for no other purpose than to have their headshots printed along a strip at the bottom of the movie poster.)   ---  --- In "Meteor", a huge chunk of an asteroid, blasted out of its benign orbit after by a wayward comet, is now heading towards earth.  Called "Orpheus", the chunk is 5 miles wide and promises to kick off a nuclear winter on arrival.  The only hope left are two space-based missile platforms lofted into orbit by NASA and the Soviet Union - each pointed at targets on Earth rather than into space.  (I don't remember if the platforms, named for Hercules and "Peter the Great" actually violated any treaties, but their owners sure seemed keen on keeping them secret.)  The Americans learn of the incoming asteroid first, having fatally positioned one of their spacecraft in the asteroid belt at the moment of the comet's collision.  They then learn that Hercules is "light" -they'll need extra missiles, and since they don't have any time to put new ones into space (and as Henry Fonda's president puts it memorably, they can't just "conjure some out of thin air") they'll have to go to the Russians for help.  Waiting for Orpheus to hit, the plot boils down to scenes of the scientists realigning their missile platforms away from Earth, and other scenes showing the devastation wrought by smaller "splinters".  (In an interesting move, there aren't any subtitles for the international targets.)  ---  --- Even if you find the special effects lame, the score annoying and the plot thin and holed as if it too was struck by a meteor, "Meteor" surprisingly gets some good mileage from its stars.  Sean Connery is great in a post-Bond role as the civilian designer of Hercules - a NASA fixture who resigned when his program was taken over by the military ("Hercules" was apparently designed just for this eventuality).  Brian Keith is also great as Dubov, Connery's Russian counterpart.  The script has most of the Yankees getting along with the Russians, so he's never a foil for Connery, but he gets some good scenes going from a genial to an enraged Soviet, improbably speaking all his lines in Russian.  Karl Malden also rises above what seems like an incredibly unnecessary role as a NASA bureaucrat - he's neither scientist, engineer or politician, but he keeps Connery's maverick in line.  Landau, a great actor, plays the thankless role of the cold-war hawk of a general who fears the Russians more than shooting stars.  The FX are actually pretty good for pre-CGI (mostly excelling in the space sequences).  The music seems repetitive, but Laurence Rosenthal's score is also evocative of the Russians and the oncoming Asteroid.  Much of the movie drags on and many sequences seem redundant. (Did they need all of the "splinter" scenes?  The "Avalanche" sequence is most ludicrous - the world is coming to an end, but there's no hint on any of the faces of those out skiing the alps in that sequence.)  That said, the plusses and minuses of this flick make it memorable, and the plusses make it worth watching.  The script places the control center for Hercules underneath the old AT&T bulding in TriBeCa, and I admit I can't pass the place without thinking of this movie
I bought this pump the day I was discharged from the hospital (12/11/05). I have used it on a part time basis since I am staying home and nurse directly. However, the motor broke and couldn't pump anymore. My baby is only 5 months and this pump already broke. I have only used it during nights to keep a storage for my baby. I was lucky to call Medela on time since this pump is still under its 6 month warranty period so I could get my money back.
I did a great deal of research on the Internet for the "best" shower filter. I was concerned about the filter not lasting, losing water pressure, etc. I came across the Aquasana on amazon and read all the great reviews on it... After ordering it, I am so glad that I did. It was really easy to install and I honestly feel like the water pressure coming out of it is BETTER than with my old shower head. The shower head swivels and has several different settings, like massage, rainfall-type flow, etc. It really does feel like you are showering in spring water. Just the idea of showering in chlorine-free and mineral-free water is refreshing in itself. I am really happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend it to anyone living in an apartment who wants filtered water and who cannot install a filter on the main line.... It's a little pricy but well worth it.
Terrible reception.  Tinny speaker.  Radio does not "remember" last used station when turned off.  Don't waste your money
Do you want the real secret on how to grow your hair? First, you need to have a healthy diet that includes plenty of vegetables and protein. PROTEIN! Then you have to keep your hair and scalp clean, trim your ends, and not use heating appliances all the time! Lastly, drink water! That's the secret! You go on a hair care board and you'll find people who swear by Vivisical. They'll show you before and after pictures and in the after picture it's just the person with their head tilted all the back just to make it look like their hair grew 5 inches in 2 months! Don't believe that nonsense! If you buy Viviscal, you're a sucker! You're better off just taking a multi-vitamin
I have owned the Caruso Molecular steam hairsetter for at least the last 15 years and would not buy any other hairsetting product. It is gentle on the hair and gives a wonderful, soft, steamed curl, as opposed to harsh, electric hot curlers. I recently purchased the new "smaller version", because my old one - with the larger water/heating unit, burned out after many years of use. The old one required more water and a bit of salt. It gave great steam, filling the rollers with a lot of steam, thus giving a better curl to the hair. This newer version does not require salt, uses very little water, and does not have the steam making power the older version did. I am very dissappointed in this "newly designed" product. I have packed it away, and will use it only as a back up. I hate it when you use a product for many years and find they have upgraded, improved, or discontinued the product. Sometimes, it is best to leave well enough alone. I will purchasing one of the older hairsetters on Ebay
You can only ride for 45 minutes after charging the battery for 12 hours. Forget about buying an extra battery to charge while you ride, because of the adapter it only charges while its on  the machine. There is no seperate battery charger.
If you want the original recordings, don't purchase any volume of Television's Greatest Hits.  I've had better luck recording the songs off of my TV with a cassette tape recorder and then dehissing them on my PC.  These collections have sterile sounding fake stereo recordings of "The Beverly Hillbillies" and "The Munsters" that just don't sound right to me.  If the original recordings don't matter to you, then you may like this CD
Wonderful instrumentals and lyrics.  A Shenandoah Lullaby is simply beautiful.  I love the way the ending segues into Brahm's lullaby.   His version of Arkansas traveller is refreshing.  Teddy Bears' Picnic is a quaint song that few people have heard.  There Ain't No Bugs On Me is my two-year-old daughter's favorite, judging from the way she belts out this song and giggles from time to time.  I like all the songs on the CD.  A breath of fresh air for parents who prefer real instruments to synthesized pop.
This product could put user/customer's life at risk. The mapping software navigates user turning into a one way street and takes you to a very remote off-road. This is the worst product that I have used in my life.
It reminded me of when I got mud in my mouth, while playing diggers in the garden as a child! --- Sorry but this wasn't for me I'm affaid.  --- The water just turned black and it tasted 'earthy'
I have loved Dolce & Gabanna light blue since it came out.  I was so excited to find it at such a competitive price at amazon, and am certainly a satisfied customer!  The shipping was so fast, I was expecting to wait at least 2 weeks, and it was delivered ahead of schedle!  Thanks so much
Beautifully done, Kids Discover issues are packed with information on one specific subject (ie: volcanoes, the Civil War...). My daughter is 8 and a good student. She uses these magazines as reference texts more than as casual reading material. I think these magazines would be enjoyed most by parents and students between the ages of 10 to 14. --- 
A very good, very quick military history overview - hits all the main points without belaboring any, gives the reader a good list of authors to look at after finishing Howard
I wish that I could review how well this charger works, but unfortunately I can't.  The reason is because it was dead on arrival.  I essentially bought a $20.00 (with eek technology's outrageous shipping) brick.  It never worked, ever, and shipping it back to exchange would cost more than a new unit!  At least I have the 4 batteries it came with, so it isn't a total loss.  Don't make the same mistake.  Steer clear of this piece of junk
I love EVERY track on Ne-Yo's CD "in my own words!" Next let me thank Ne-Yo for bringing true R&B back to the industry! I dont consider songs about cheating on your bf/gf/husband/wife R&B. R&B is supposed to be about love - thats why people call them slow LOVE songs. And from 2001 - 2005 new slow love songs didn't exist. I ended up listenin to the same songs from da 90's over and over until I got so tired of them, and was fortunate to be lucky enough for my radio station (that plays mostly rap: a genre of music I dont like) to play "so sick" by Ne-Yo. It was a great song. This is literally the FIRST and only R&B album that I never have the urge to use the fast forward feature to get to the next song! Ne-Yo's lyrics are strictly romantic and sweet too! He is a lyrical genius. His voice is soothing and melodic. Most R&B albums obviously have rap tracks or rushed R&B songs as filler to probably meet the deadline or get the CD out as fast as possible and reducing the enjoyability of the CD, but THIS album has ALL songs that are great. All of the tracks on this album are great, but here are the ones that are SUPERB: ---  --- 1. So sick - 9/10 (would be a 10 if it wasn't played over and over and with so many different versions. Although I can still listen to it over and over --- 2. When you're mad - 9/10 (for those guys who like the look on girls faces when they get mad. Maybe for Michelle Rodriguez fans. :) ) --- 3. Get Down Like that 10/10 (both versions) (I call it "dont get down like that") (This song is for the guys that are completely faithful like me) (if you're not a player, and proud of being faithful, this is da song for you) --- 4. Sexy Love - 10/10 (great song. um hmmm.. what can i say about THIS one about its lyrics?.... oh yes.... this song is for the guys who have a girl and when she touches them, it just feels like.... Magic.) ---  --- This is da only CD dat ever deserved 5 stars by me, the only reason I gave OTHER R&B albums 5 stars is cuz i took into consideration: there was no R&B album that existed that had NOTHING but good tracks, and most had poorly done upbeat song
This Air Supply should've been cut off a very long time ago.  Whenever any of their songs comes on the radio I immediately shut it off.  Bad ear candy is all they ever recorded.  Mindless, sappy garbage.  Even Bread's music  was more interesting than this
I don't want to spoil this movie for others and I won't. CACHE is French for HIDDEN and  alot was left hidden. Why does the son suddenly do what he did? Why does he think his mother is doing what he thinks she's doing? I didn't care one bit about any of the charactors. This is a slow going movie with no conclusion. If you have a choice between watching this movie or watching paint dry, flip a coin. I watch international films often and usually fnd them more rewarding than most US made films. Not this one.
Gave these to my wife as part of a birthday gidt and she loves them. She says they feel more comfortable than most "stud"-type and they look great
Nothing even close to "say no More" I'm sorry I spent the mone
There are two good ways to tell what audience at which a woodworking magazine is aimed.  The first is the type of advertising, and the second is how much skill do the projects expect you to have.  It is pretty clear right away that Woodworker's journal server home woodworkers who are already of moderate skill.  The advertised 'big toys' run in the 500 to 1500 dollar range, although there are a couple of high end combination machines in the adds as well.   ---  --- Articles expect you to know how to use the tools of the trade but not sure about the 'best' way to do something.  A recent issue makes a study of an intarsia backed high chair with some interesting joinery, and instructions for making a genuinely exotic angle jig for a table saw.  Writing is solid and reasonably illustrated, but they devote little space to what you should already know, which can make these projects a stretch for a tyro. ---  --- The Magazine is very tool oriented.  There isn't a lot of space devoted to hand tools or history.  Expect articles comparing nail guns and helping you decide whether stationary or bench top equipment is right for you.  However, traditionally manual tasks like finishing also receive their due.  I found the Woodworker's Journal suited me quite well, and I expect to continue reading it
A friend gave this to me for my 6 month old daughter - the walker itself is wonderful, but the light and sound feature is just the worst - as others have said, it dies after about 2 months, and the battery is non-replacable. My daughter loved the sounds and now they just die and warble and I can't stand it! If you buy it, don't get it for the music/lights - they will let you down
I'm not certain why there are so many glowing reviews for this product.  My wife registered for this item because the 4 stage tub looked good in theory.  Unfortunately, because of the collapsible design this "bath" tub does not hold water, it just runs out of the seam where the two sides come together.  There is a foam gasket around the seam that is intended to hold the water in, but it is useless. --- The sling is useful for bathing an infant, and the removable ring does it's job of keeping an infant upright while learning to sit.  Unfortunately, by the time our infant was ready to sit we had already replaced this piece of junk.  I guess they call it Safety 1st as your kid can't drown in a dry bath tub
I have enjoyed eating Marzipan, since a child.  Now many, many --- years later I still enjoy eating it on Holidays. It is a combination of cooking and artwork. This Wisconsin Cheeseman, --- company makes the best Marzipan I have ever had.  It is not too --- sweet like most others make it, and it light and not doughy. --- Eating their Marzipan is a blissful experience, and after a busy --- day of working, this is my private joy.  I highly recommend it, --- and I feel that everyone should try Marzipan at least once in --- their life, you will not be sorry
This edition of the color calibration hardware and software is very professional - a fact that is reflected in the price tag. However, the difference between the uncalibrated and calibrated states on a television is very noticeable. --- The kit includes the colorimeter (color measurement device) with a USB connection. The assumption here is that a laptop or nearby desktop is available to calibrate the televisions. The software makes calibration extremely easy. It allows the user to select which color and picture controls the TV allows them to use (not all televisions present the same controls, and even then, they often have different names) and modifies its process accordingly. Calibration takes approximately 30-45 minutes, but the results are undeniably an improvement. --- The kit comes in a sturdy plastic case with foam cutouts for the hardware and software (much like a Stargate SG-1 case for an alien device :-) ). While expensive, the software and hardware can be used on nearly anything that displays a picture - TVs of any kind and computer monitors - without limit. --- The one caveat is that, for LCD and other TVs or monitors with "delicate" screens, the suction cup provided to stick the colorimeter to the device requires a good deal of force. In fact, the force required is more than I am comfortable with applying to any display I have, except CRTs. As such, calibration requires one to either hold the colorimeter to the TV for each measurement (not really a problem), or buy the tripod for the device. This is the only downside. --- This device is definitely of professional quality and is a must for any home theater enthusiast or the perfectionist in your household. It might even be possible to recover the cost of the unit by becoming a calibration technician... :-
I also had the older Diaper Champ and it broke so I got this new one, "New And Improved"! I don't know if they've ever tested this product. It's impossible to get the diaper bag out of the Diaper champ. It's big from the bottom and small from the top so when you try to get the bag out of it, it always gets stuck and if you try harder then the bag rips! It's absolutely horrible product. NEW OR SOON TO BE MOMS - DO NOT BUY THIS!!
  This is the all time, great, original classic.  The remake is .......ok --- at best.   Add this to your classic movie collection.  ---  Highly recommended
I ordered my subscription 3 months ago and still have not received it. 
I had this for my daughter when she fit into the baby carrier car seat.  It was awesome.  I never had to worry about blankets falling off or if she was warm enough.  They did tell me at the hospital, however, that if you put anything between your baby and the car seat it voids the warranty on the car seat.  This goes underneath them so it probably does, but I figured it was probably safer than putting a blanket over her anyway
This Yakima roof rack system works great and I highly recommend it. I bought one for my Mazda 3 and have use it, along with a Yakima roof rack for 2 cross country ski trips (I live a Florida, skiing is far away). The rack hasn't shifted an inch and was relatively easy to install. Yakima has a product guide on their site to make sure you order the right pieces for your model car
It gave me a lot of energy and I was able to lift a noticeable amount of weight on my first work out using the product.  I also noticed better and faster results from using No-Xplode.  I like it
Sound quality was fine but this CD changer doesnt work well at all. I am one of the buyers that had the same problems as many others with the CD changer. Tried to play shuffle with all discs and it just stops playing after a while. It also has problems just changing to the next sequential CD. Apparently Sony didn't do proper quality testing on this product. I returned mine and after these other reviews won't be replacing it with a Sony. I hope this is a message to Sony. 
I am 51 and recently visited an upscale retail store in Manhattan.  The Yves St Laurent gal behind the cosmetic counter noticed my complexion was a little sallow - put this product about an inch on each side of my nose and blended it in..what a difference it made...a worthwhile investment..I use it under my eyes and just about all over my face for a nice touch-up, concealer and brightener..covers freckles and sun spots, too
The case looks great and fits well, but it's nearly impossible to remove.  I had to insert a credit card between the latches and pry for a long time.  I was afraid of hurting both the case and the iPod.  In addition, it's too wide in the case to dock in my Logitech speaker system.  I might have considered keeping it if I could have just snapped the case off for docking
This is a great puppet theater, sound stage, restaurant, play house, etc...  My daughter was 4 when she received this from Santa.  He only wished he had found it sooner!  My daughter continues to love it, and will now be sharing it with her younger sister.  Many hours of pretend have been spent inside and outside this theater.  We especially love it because it is large enough inside for two or more children.  All the others we researched were too small for our needs.  The colors are so vibrant and fun, we get tons of compliments from all our company.  All the kids gravitate towards it
I could not get the right code numbers to work with my new TV/DVD set.....too bad, I liked the large numbers and light.
The original nursers enabled me to return to work after a long maternity leave.  My baby wouldn't take the bottle until I introduced the brown rubber nipple.  Thanks Mom
Ok, first of all Oct Fri the 13th I FINALLY saw this movie in 3D, sigh I can die happy! Ok this one is really pretty awesome. Chris plays a great leading girl (the only F-13 leadI didnt want to see with an axe in her skull). The other characters are pretty harmless too. Wev'e got bikers (snort), pothead hippies, a fro'd chubster and a dude who can walks on his hands better than he can act. Plus this came out in the early 80's so the ratings board didnt demolish all the awesome gore scenes. I give this one a high-5! Cool deaths, funny scenes and aside from Chris's sherbert pants, some decent 80's fashion too. Yo Debbie, I want your bikini, too cuuute.
So it's not a big deal to reset your clocks when the time changes and when the power goes out, right? Well... yes it is. As I get older and technology becomes more demanding and time consuming, the fact that I can have ONE DEVICE that takes care of itself has become fairly important to me. It's just a clock, but... it works. Which is more than I can say for my fax or copier or phone or... I always get LaCross because I like the looks of their stuff. Be good to yourself- upgrade to Atomic
The Rion Mini Lean-To greenhouse comes in a flimsy cardboard box that contains about a hundred plastic parts. It difficult to put together because the parts are poorly labeled. (Making it even more difficult for me was that several parts were missing.) The 12 page instruction manual shows several diagrams - but no photos - with parts labelled to help with assembly. One classic exerpt on page 7, "The 'OUT' on the 2D connector should face the inside of the Mini Lean-To". This kind of product gives the term "some assembly required" a bad name.  ---  --- Also, it's a bit pricely to be so flimsy and poorly designed. Save yourself the trouble get something else.  ---  ---  --- 
How can we ever be disappointed by a Anthony Hopkins performance? In my opinion, one of the best actors of all time ( especially his portrayal of Hannibal Lecter ). In this movie, he plays a anthropologist first living in Africa among the rare and beautiful mountain gorillas. After defending the gorillas and killing 2 poachers in the process, he is captured and sent to a mental institution where a psychologist played by Cuba Gooding Jr.( who gives a good performance) tries to delve in the mind of Hopkins' character and help him. I just love the flashbacks to Africa and the gorillas. Very touching scenes in this movie along with great acting. My favorite part of the movie is the ending where we see Hopkins return to the gorillas and the place he feels he truly belongs and truly wants to be. Great movie!
Jonathan should spent more time with Scott from Zorbitt because the packaging is second rate.  The product itself was subpar also
The unit requires registration and an authorization number from the manufacture before maps can be loaded into the compact flash card. This requires determining the CF card ID when registering. Instructions for this procedure are very poor and navigating Magellan's web site is tricky at best. If you enter the CF ID incorrectly, you cannot store any maps in the unit even if you are provided an authorization code for the CF card. Beware
I purchased this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it...as do I.  It isn't too 'perfume-y' and smells terrific
I am a parent of a 9 year old daughter who loves dolls. She was given the Love me CHOU CHOU doll for Christmas (12/25/05). On Christmas day we were unable to get the doll to fall asleep, so on 12/26/05 I went back to the store to exchange the doll. With no luck I found that the second doll would not fall asleep either. I looked on the zapf-creation web-site under most frequently asked questions and received more instructions on how to get the doll to fall asleep and still the doll will not fall asleep.  ---   --- Apparently this is a problem, not only with the doll my daughter has but with other customers as well. If the company knows that this is one of the most frequently asked questions, why not remodel the doll so she can fall asleep like the instructions say? It is very discouraging for a 9 year old who has hopes of seeing the doll do something that is being advertised and it does not do that. It is also very upsetting to a parent who has to continue going back and forth to a store and hopes of looking for a working doll. These dolls are very expensive and should work like the instructions say they should.   ---  --- We have tried everything we can to get the Love me chou chou doll to fall asleep and nothing seems to make that happen.. I have even spoken with another parent in the store where the doll was purchased and was advised her daughter also was crying on Christmas day because they could not get the doll to fall asleep. She then explained, she had her mother a grandmother to rock the doll and guess what the doll finally fell asleep keep in mind this was not rock-a-bye chou chou. We have even tried to rock this doll with no luck of getting the doll to fall asleep. ---   --- I have even taken the doll back to the store for an exchange, but was advised the doll is no longer being sold at the store where I purchased it. ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  
**** --- Tazo's Decaffeinated Chai Black Tea is an enjoyable chai experience for the most part. On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a rich blend of full-flavored naturally decaffeinated teas and exotic aromatic spices." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Decaffeinated Chai as "creamy, vanilla, sweet and pungent spices". Tazo describes the aroma as "sweet spice". Those are pretty accurate. The black tea "blend" is a little bitter, though, even with minimal brewing. It's a real trick to get it to brew long enough to get to experience the flavor from the spices without having the tea turn bitter. ---  ---  --- The ingredients in Decaffeinated Chai are: naturally decaffeinated black teas, rooibos, cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, chicory, cloves, black pepper, natural flavors, and star anise. It is caffeine-free! ---  --- Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea. ---  --- I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Decaffeinated Chai gets only four stars. --- ***
I am so disappointed that it did not have any closed caption or subtitle for the deaf.  I had to return it
Simply THE tool for getting your business put together.  It's able to do just about everything you'd ever want to do!!
Other than the power switch is not easy to see, the most issue with this microphone is the sound quality  not that good.  Use this microphone to record music for sure will disappoint you.  Even using it for church meeting recording, you would not get excited for its sound quality. ---  --- If you can tolerate the size of Sony ECM-MS907, you may like the sound quality of that microphone. If you like a small lapel microphone with true voice, try the AKG WMS-40 wireless system.  Our people are much happier with the AKG wireless microphone than this one. --- 
Completely useless. Only shows a digital display when Ipod is "fully charged" -- how long does YOUR Ipod stay fully charged? Even when showing digital display doesn't actually broadcast. Maxell replaced it with the p-4A for a reason. Amazon shouldn't even be selling this, it makes me distrust Amazon. I got it as a Christmas present but it was bought in October so they won't even take it back.  ---  --- Follow up: After I emailed Amazon, they issued a complete refund, which they refused to do over the phone. Now they just need to pull the product, since they (probably wisely) aren't carrying the P-4A and therefore can't recommend it as an option.
... I highly recommend this magazine to anyone interested or immersed in the graphic design industry. I have kept every single issue and frequently refer to them for ideas, reference, or to simply get those creative juices flowing. HOW's biggest asset is their dedication to helping the reader understand the business side of the industry and the all important client relationship. HOW does not exclude anyone in that they address the different issues agencies and freelancers face when conducting business
Well, besides a whole bucket full of money, one of them lets you take photos in lower light, okay, that's obvious. The 16-35mm is a bit heavier, but not so you'd notice, unless maybe you were carrying it around all day, without eating and you're a bit over the hill. So why pay the extra money, unless, of course, you do a lot of shooting in the early morning and late evening? ---  ---  Maybe you shouldn't, because I've been doing a lot of photo taking with both, film and digital, and as one would expect from the "L" lenses, the photos are crisp and sharp. In fact I keep I the 17-40 on the camera I carry around all day, you know, the one I might leave on the table in a restaurant when I got to the restroom. It's a lot less money to lose to someone looking for a five finger discount. However, my gal pal Sara and I take a lot of early morning photos. She shoots old houses, and she never, ever goes out without the 16-35mm. She swears by it, loves it, sometimes I think better than me. ---  --- So there is a difference, I'm the kind of person that could happily live with less expensive lense, Sara is not. However they both deliver gorgeous photos. You can't go wrong if the lense has that red circle around it. ---  --- Jack Priest, Sailor Home from the Se
if you have used the online version in the past, stick with it. buying it on disk does not allow you to import data from previous returns if done on line and you can not upload to myturbotax. almost as if two separate companies! plus the User interface on this software stinks bigtime. very hard to navigate back and forth. online version is actually better (though i didn't try it this year). does intuit actually employ programmers or watch real users? they spend far too much money on useless features like videos and not enough on simple ui issues
Saw this on Jay Leno and it was a Hilarious Gift!  Tried it out and it dances to the chicken dance song and when you grab its neck it yelpsand pretends to choke then when you let go it continues its dance.  I Can't wait to give it as a Christmas Present.
The cover is exactly what I needed to protect our smoker from the weather. It is strong and appears to be durable.  I felt that the price was fair for this product
This is the perfect little tv/dvd for a little girl's room! The picture is great and Hello Kitty pops on screen for certain commands (volume, channel change..). My daughter age 4 loves it. I would have given this product 5 stars but there are a couple drawbacks...the remote control is has SO many buttons and they are VERY tiny, very close together. I can barely read what each button does because the labels/print is also VERY tiny. This is annoying when in my daughter's darkened room and I have to turn on a bright light just to find the pause button... the other thing I have to point out that bugs me is that you can't eject/or open the dvd player unless the tv is in dvd mode. In other words when I go to put in a dvd, I can't just push "open". Nothing will happen. You have to find the right button, choose "dvd" from a choice of 3-4 things, and only then will the tray slide open. All in all, these things would not prevent me from buying this tv again...although it would be nice if they did come out w/ a more kid friendly remote with bigger buttons/symbols for a small child to recognize... One great thing I want to point out--there is fast forward scan that you can watch as it fast forwards (something not all dvd players offer) and this is great when you are putting a dvd in for your child and they want to skip all those pre-movie ads....you can FF right to the beginning of the movie!!!    
Wish I could give this a negative.  When I did finally get a sticker out, it wouldn't stay stuck to anything for more than five minutes.  Ended up sending it back to the wholesaler as unworkable and overpriced
My kids got these from Grandpa.  They love them!  They're fun to bowl with in a dark room.  We've clipped them onto headboards for a decent-sized reading light. ---  --- The problems: The clip is pretty hard to operate, even for an adult.  Also, the plastic base broke on each of our lights (in different places), so now they're clip-less.  They're still well-loved and well-used by the little guys, though.   ---  --- I recommend these lights, but be careful w/ the bases
My 3 year old daughter got this puzzle for Christmas and she simply adores it. This is her fourth Melissa & Doug puzzle and I have to say she loves them all. As soon as she is done with one she puts it away and runs for another one. Keep making wonderful puzzles Melissa & Doug!
Label states that it is for a 600....it doesnt fit a 650 as well as I thought i
Another lense jam problem. The lense cover accidentally slide open in my pocket, and the lense extended and jammed. This happened frequently with my old Powershot S30 but never caused a problem.  ---  --- Canon said the warranty is void because there's a tiny dent on the front and back. They said ANY physical damage voids the warranty. I complained that the camera has an all metal body which dings easily. They gave me 20% off the repair
I used to buy pods at Starbucks, but I started longing for something a little more authentic. Luckily, my fiancee bought me the PodMerchant Megasampler as a Christmas present. I was overwhelmed! ---  --- I never knew there were so many different kinds of espresso pods available, especially from one store. The selection in this sampler is huge, and it includes both caffeinated and decaf pods.  (There is also the Super Sampler but it doesn't include decaf, which is nice sometimes in the evening). ---  --- After trying these pods we found which espressos we liked best and have been buying those, but it all started with the Mega sampler. The shipping was also very fast. ---  --- If you're looking to expand your coffee horizons and have an espresso pod machine, you'll almost certainly find some new favorites in here
This is a surprisingly poor movie. Although it has some well-known actors, and a notable director, the material was just presented badly and predictably - like a lousy late night TV-movie with profanity inserted to liven it up. ---  --- The movie makes a simplified joke of the legal system and its sterotypical failings (though legitimate in many cases). It also glosses over the grieving process of the family, ignores the normal safety warnings to the remaining child, overdoes Kiefer Sutherland's character flaws (which are considerable nevertheless), and generally oversimplifies everything into a neat package to which you already know the ending because of the spoiler title. ---  --- In one particularly-bad scene, after taking martial arts classes and other measures to prepare herself mentally and physically, Sally's character simply stares open-mouthed and dumbfounded at Keifer's character when they meet on the street and he talks to her. ---  --- I don't know what I missed that the 4- and 5-star reviewers like so much. I only see wide-spread mediocrity. ---  --- I would only recommend this for fans of Keifer. "Ssssssorry", Sally, not your best role or movie. Ditto Ed Harris, whose other movies I generally like. --- 
I just cam from Las Vegas and the sandisk has a disk error that doesn't allow for more photos after only using 40mb. I have tried to format the disk using the camera and through Windows XP. It doesn't allow it to be formatted. Bad investment!!! Would not recommend the product unless there is a way I can get a refund or an exchange
purchased the phone about 3 months, like the nice QVGA screen, and impressed with excellent cam (it works pretty well in macro mode and outdoors) --- the phone has good reception, at least on par with W810 --- voice call is OK, but as other users stated, the level is kinda low (esp speakerphone), firmware upgrade (R1KC001) will help --- the operation is standard SE style, if you are familiar, you'll be OK without reading manual --- the audio player can play streaming 3gp and realaudio (still used by BBC), and it works well with T-Mobile internet; it can play local mp3 (VBR supported), wma, asf audio (rename the extension to .wma), realaudio; but I wish it supports ogg vorbis, which is the audio format I use --- bluetooth works pretty well, it works with ALL bt equipment I have (including wireless headphones) --- logitech headphones users please read: in order to make the headphones works properly, you need to go to bt menu, and connect from there --- web browser can handle regular html sites as well as simplified html, and wap sites --- the phone is kinda bulky, and a bulge on cam cover, but it's pretty comfortable and firm to hold, making messaging is a good pleasure --- though the phone has lot of functions/features are pretty appealing, it lacks something it's supposed to have: --- quad-band, this is not acceptable for this price, even many lower models have quad-band (K550, W610, W580, W810, Z710, W710) --- music player should have more file format support: ogg vorbis, streamimg wma/asf, shoutcast --- m2 memory card, though the phone has possibility to support up to 32GB, PSP card is a lot cheaper --- pro: --- QVGA screen, and it shows clock when the phone is idle --- wireless headphones support --- 3mpx cam with auto-focus and xenon flash --- comfortable and firm to hold --- con: --- low earpiece and speakerphone level (though firmware upgrade will fix) --- tri-band --- cam cover bulge --- conclusion: if you want a phone with excellent screen and cam, go for it, however, if you travel a lot, settle with quad-band models (they're cheaper
I gave birth to a premature infant that had to spend a week in the NICU.  Because of that I was forced to establish my milk supply w/ a breastpump.  The morning after I gave birth my husband went Walmart to pick up some of things that we hadn't purchased.  I called him crying and told him that he had to find something for my sore nipples.  Well this is what he brought back.  The relief was instantaneous. I bought a couple more boxes as my daughter "learned" to breastfeed.  I use another of their nipple creams for everyday use(they're too expensive to use everday), but I make sure that there is always a box of these in my cabinet! 
Did not work at all. I used cheaper products that I bought from walgreens and walmart that reduced the razor bumps but not completely eliminate them. --- Since Princereigns promised to be a miracle product, I bought it in hopes of completely eliminating the bumps but it did't even reduce them. Complete waste of money
These guys and this album rocks.  Just because the songs force you to move other parts of your body beside your head, doesn't 'demote' it to pop.  Props to the great use of two bass guitars.  Released amid the misery/grunge rock explosion of the early 90's, this was a great escape into rock that just simply made you feel good again. This album is highly recommended.  Kill Your Television, Grey Cell Green, Cut Up, Throwing Things, Happy, and Until You Find Out are just an awesome experience.  If you can find the Grey Cell Green single release, I highly recommend that for the track entitled 'Trust.' 
Gone are the days of overpriced department store products that do absolutly nothing for your skin! Gone are the days of spending too much money for a product that sits in your bathroom and collects dust! ---  --- This is stuff is kick ass! --- If you are the type to buy a product that is endorced by a celebrity, then you can be satisfied here, and if you go to the Mario Badescu website you can see all the celebrities who have gone to the spa and used the products. ---  --- If you are looking for a product that makes your skin feel clean and fresh, without spending your paycheck, then you have found the perfect company!!! ---  --- I have been using the products from Mario Badescu for three years now, and I have gotten my Mom, Mother-in-Law, Sister, and other friends and family to become Mario Badescu junkies too. ---  --- That all said, if you want something to pamper yourself look no further. ---  --- (Try the Seaweed Soap, and the Orange Protective Cream. And if you have a problem with Pimples then look for the drying lotion, but beware its strong stuff.
If you have never heard Book Of Shadows by Zakk Wylde, then you may be suprised by this album. The two albums are similiar in that they contain a lot more acoustic guitar, and although I'm not saying that past releases have not contained emotion, HM VI contains more. ---  --- For example, take 'She Deserves a free ride' and the ballad 'Fear'. The piano on this album is superb, haunting at one point and almost relaxing at another. However, there is just enough of past 'metal' BLS in this album - 'Crazy or High' and 'House Of Doom'. Personal favourites are 'Damage is Done', 'Layne' and 'Queen Of Sorrow'. There is something more in the solo's - they come in at just the right time and as usual are perfectly executed - check out 'Stepping Stone' for an example. The musicianship has got even better on this album, with the dodgy drums on 1919 Eternal Gone, and the bass that was pushed to the background in The Blessed Hellride is up there with Zakk's playing. ---  --- This album is deep, moving piece that is the perfect successor to the blistering Blessed Hellride. Can't wait for the new Mafia CD to be released.
Wonderful magazine! The receipes are excellent, I have tried several and they are all keepers! They are tasty, low calorie, high fiber etc. The format of the magazine is great and there interesting articles as well as recipes
This is one of my favorite cereals! It appears to be nutritionally superior to the Heritage O's and less crunchy.  --- The only downside to this cereal is that it doesn't keep me full for long. I feel like an hour later, I'm hungry again. I've combated this by adding banana slices or blueberries to add some bulk to my bowl in hopes of more lasting power.  --- An upside to the 'downside' is that this makes a terrific between meals snack! I have no problem with polishing off all six boxes in a timely manne
These are beautiful earrings.  They are a bit small but the stones are vibrant and rich looking.  My only complaint is that the post part of the earring is not very substantial and I feel as though I need to handle them VERY carefully.  They are extremely comfortable and have just the right amount of movement to them. 
It seems that just about every house in our subdivision has an electric ride-on toy. There are few "Barbie" Jeeps, few polaris ATVs, one Corvette and three Gators and few others. My 4 year old daughter was the first Gator owner. ---  --- I must say, it is expensive.. This thing is by far the most expensive toy my daughter has, bar none. Should you buy your 4 year old $300 ride-on toy? Well... that's up to you. ---  --- But she loves her gator. She had to give up on lot of other toys to get this one, but she is extremely happy with it. Sometimes I wish I was 40lbs so I can ride this thing. She can't care less about the "barbie" thing, so this green utility machine was fine with her.  ---  --- The gator is slightly faster than others and the fat tires and truck bed makes the gator looks a lot more serious than the Barbie jeep. The truck bed is really useful. Although not recommended, she hauled two kids on the bed. With 4 kids on the car, it still zoomed around the street quite well. One time I loaded nail gun, air compressor, electric drill and jigsaw and panel saw all on the bed and asked my daughter to drive to the other side of the yard to fix the fence. I saw our neighbor hauling few bags of mulch on theirs. It made such a funnt scene.. little electric toys carrying real tools and stuff. Very cute. ---  --- Enough of fun stuff.  ---  --- Problem 1. Battery location and the hassle to recharge this thing. You have to open the front grill and sometimes the latch can pinch your finger. It hurts. ---  --- Problem 2. The left front wheel fell off while my daughter was driving it. I tightened it again and never happened.  ---  --- Problem 3. Slipping tires. People complain about the tires having very low friction. They slip very easily on driveway and grass. But this is how it "protects" its gearbox so I don't really care, but I heard they are expensive once they wear out. ---  --- I think this is the best ride-on toy on the market today. If extra $[...] won't hurt you too much, then do consider the gator. Your children will not be disappointed. ---  
To All, ---  --- I just purchased the SP-550UZ after searching for the best camera bang for the buck - Olympus fills the bill..... 3/3/07 was my first day of use and I decided to check ALL the features - with the batteries supplied - still in use and a 2GB card - I took off for the outdoors and began shooting pictures at a local park - 300 pictures - including several 15 FPS and 30 FPS shoots and  three videos - 15, 30 and 45 seconds in length. ---  --- I am not a pro and will be using this camera for Sports, vacations and every day family events. ---  --- No Cons yets - I love the "SCN" feature - just select how you want to take the picture and the camera setups the camera - all you have to do is take the picture
I love chocolate --- I love dark chocolate, especially for my drinking chocolate. --- I should have been suspicious when on the label it says you can make pudding from this as well...which should have alerted me right off the bat that there are other ingredients in the tin--not just chocolate and some sugar...it must be cornstarch. ---  --- Marie Belle makes a big deal of the fact that this is NOT cocoa, but cacao...that's why I fell for the hype...but in the end, it's the flavor that counts, and this one...I guess because of the corn starch...has a strange "mouth feel" and flavor that I find unpleasant. ---  --- I find the French brand  L'Ancienne  far superior...and my favorite drinking chocolate is  --- Charbonnell et Walker, which is not for sale (yet) on Amazon
I bought this because I have fine hair that needs to be washed every day and I get tired of washing it.  I thought I could use this every other day and get by.  ---  --- However, it doesn't make your hair look freshly washed; it is just ok.  It takes "bed head" hair and makes it look acceptable for a little while.  After a couple of hours though, my hair looks oily and stringy again. ---  --- I use it before I take the kids to school and it gets me thru the morning.  Then I end up washing my hair later
Overall this is a very good rowing machine - quiet, takes up a small amount of space, and easy to use. My only complaint would be the LCD - the first order sent to me had a damaged computer, but Amazon was quick to send out a replacement rower which took care of the problem. Now every thing is great
Watching the Melvins evolve was extremely interesting and entertaining. They began as an unassuming punk band, and proceded to incorporate the heaviness of 70's rock into their sound. Then they stripped away any and all of the "punk" trappings and went for pure HEAVY. It all culminated with this record. It just doesn't get any heavier than 'Roman Bird Dog/Hung Bunny'. 'With Teeth', rumored to actually be written by Joe Preston, is one of my all time favorite Melvins songs. Speaking of Joe Preston, he was the by far best of the Melvins' 7000+ bassists they had over the years. Shame they got rid of him shortly after this album. As soon as they fired him, they went straight down the greased pole to mediocrity Hell. Bad karma. Thank God that rock bands record their music so that it isn't lost forever every time they make stupid decisions. The only song on this record which I don't like is the cover of Alice Cooper's 'The Ballad of Dwight Fry'. Thankfully they made up for it with a cover of Flipper's 'Sacrifice'.  ---  --- Some of the Melvins' subsequent records have their moments (Stoner Witch's 'Shevil', Stag's 'Cotton Mouth'), but for the most part it seems to me that the Melvins gave up the ghost after recording this. Maybe someday they'll make a comeback
I bought these shoes for my 23 month old son. We needed something comfortable with a flexible sole, but with enough thickness in the sole to stand up outside and provide traction. They are excellent shoes and he loves them. He won't wear anything else and the shoes receive many compliments
I am a chess player myself, so I can endorse this even more. This software is well designed, it can get a little difficult to get to some exercises inside it, but kids can figure it out eventually. My son has improved his play quite a bit even though he takes hints sometimes :), but this is a good software to get the kids started and teach them all the requisite skills to become a chess playe
It's really hard to buy scrub pants on-line because everyone is different. Cherokee always fits perfectly and good quality. I think they should consider a wider array of sizes in petite. By the time I finished hemming them, I didn't have that cute slit at the bottoms. They wash well and wear well
I ordered this for My daughter when she played t-ball. She played on the cubs team and it was great. Very durable, and adjustable
These are a great, yuumy snack.  For someone who counts calories (or points), it's nice to have an option that is relatively healthy and still tastes great!  I have never met a Luna Bar I didn't like, though this is my favorite flavor
You want a cheap Fender guitar you buy their lower notch brand Squire.You want their lower notch picks,well unfortunately they dont exist.Thats where these come into to play.They are cheap and somewhat durable.Celluloid picks have a tendencey to snap right across the middle though. ---  --- They wield great sound and if used right like any other guitar pick great potential.The looks are nice but i like the signature of a real Fender pick.After all these are the Fender pick shape and size. ---  --- I say buy these the price is a steal.I say avoid these if you plan to play metal. --- (A very nice feeling pick
I have used this item for 2 oil changes and it seems to work well.  I am concerned with the longevity of the hose connections however, I would be afraid that they could develop vacuum leaks over time since it is simply a matter of inserting the drain hose rather than a more formal type of attachment
This DVD teaches the history of Tai Chi, and the History of the 24 posture form and 48 posture form. It explains that these two Tai Chi forms were originally a martial art style, and that now they are usually done for health improvement.  ---  --- Then it shows the 24 posture form from the front, and the back, and with breathing instructions. Im not quite ready to try to coordinate my breathing with the movements, but when I am, this is a great guide. It then shows each of the 24 postures, and their original martial art applications, which helps you have a strong intent during the posture, and keeps your arms and legs in proper position. THEN, it teaches the 24 posture form, step by step, with very detailed instruction. This is a much more expanded version of this video by Master Liang than the original VHS.  ---  --- The DVD also shows the 48 posture form, which repeats several of the movements from the 24 posture form, and has other movements from other styles.  ---  --- It has absolutely helped me develop strength and balance in a few short weeks of practicing only the 24 posture form about 4 days a week on average. It has also improved my confidence, and people keep saying I have a glow about me. I just feel healthier, and happier too.  ---  --- This DVD is easy to learn from quickly. The Chinese bamboo flute music is nice. Oh, actually, my FAVORITE part is at the end, it shows a 'slideshow' of photos of the master, doing each posture move-by-move, with great music. I like to do my form along to this section, because it is a bit slower than the actual form, and you can exactly match your movements to the master. Its like having a one-on-one class with him. I find that this mimicing of his postures has helped me to learn more quickly. I remember the form now, without having to 'THINK', so I can try to turn my attention inward.  ---  --- A great DVD
I'm a huge Orson Welles fan and actually regret making this public knowledge - but I hated this film. I was excited to crack open the beautiful packaging and quickly fell into a disappointing episode of feeling really dumb that I just didn't get it. The photography was classic Welles - the acting was something out of a bad rehersal at an insane asylum. Don't get caught up in having to like it, just because it's Welles - it's ok to go against the grain and declare to the world - this movie blows
Madonna gives a stunning performance...Explicit similated sex and graphic language...We really enjoyed the concert...This is defininatly one of her best...Now if we can get the blond ambition tour from japan and the usa, i would be very happy...5 star rated. i own this disc
This printer sucks! It started out working wonderfully. Then all of a sudden (after the third month in use) it started printing very slowly. Then it decided it wouldn't print at all unless I completely shut down my computer everytime. Something is wrong when you can only get 200 sheets of paper out of text only documents from the black ink cartridge. It also uses the color ink when it's not requested. I only needed the color ink a couple of times (not for pictures) and it went just as fast as the black. I used to love hp. They are now making garbage. I'm thinking of looking at the OKI brand. Don't waste your money on this one
I bought this as a present for my wife.  I was looking for something that she could carry in her purse.  the automatic functions are easy and functional.  It is not an enthusiasts camera:  too hard to get into the menus.  The screen is easy to turn off(this sucks battery power).  and it even has an optical viewfinder(a rare finding lately)  the optical viewfinder helps to get steady pictures for those of us with the shakes.  The pictures are clear and the colors are excellent.  The drawback is the that sony batteries cost an arm and a leg.  The wire for downloading pix is multifunctional and very proprietary(read that as expensive if you lose it
I purchased this frame as a gift for a friend of mine. When I saw it on her desk and noticed the terrible quality of the images, I was embarassed that I had given such an inferior item as a gift.  Perhaps the images she had loaded were quite low resolution, but the pictures looked terrible with huge pixels. ---  --- I would not recommend this item at all
This CD was devoid of any of Govi's usual emotional imprint or soaring guitar work. Frankly, it was just a bunch of New Age background noise that one would hear on elevators. Some of the Craig Chaquico-style stuff was interesting, but better left to Craig. Try 7th Heaven, Mosaico or Guitar Odyssey instead
It just is! Not much else to say about this
The changer performs perfectly.  I was surprised that the price was so high for such a simple gadget.  The only other drawback is that the cord is not as long as the original, about one foot shorter.  Other than that, it is fine.  I gave my original changer to my daughter, whose charger died just before leaving the country
You've got a lot of ab-rollers. You need a gimmick: The product is  no better than the competition. You don't have an ad budget. What do you do?  CHARGE FOUR TIMES AS MUCH. Then just sit and wait for the 'clients' who are looking for a 'quality' product to assume that the high price actually means something
I bought this product for childproofing purposes.  I was disappointed to learn upon delivery that the manufacturer's instructions state not to install gate against drywall (which was not in the item description), so i cannot use it where i needed it.  Also, the unlocking mechanism is quite difficult to open and close, especially with a small child in your arms. 
I am listening to Badfinger even as I type this review. --- This is the Best Of Badfinger Vol 2, and I thought volume 1 was great !! As previous reviewers have said, what an absolute tragedy the story of Badfinger is (Buy the Book "Without You" the tragic story of Badfinger). --- Well I have everything they have released, if you do buy any of the Badfinger best ofs, you will more than likely get hooked and start collecting all of their albums.Some of the best songs on this Cd are off "Wish You Were Here" their best album by a mile IMHO.In fact 6 of the 9 songs on WYWH are on this compilation. --- They were such an original group with every member capable of writing an exhilirating hit song. just have a taste of "Just A Chance", "You're So Fine", "Meanwhile back At The Ranch/Should I Smoke".They were just so good, Damn I miss them
I bought this reader when my engine light came on. Turns out I could fix the problem myself with a 15 dollar part. The dealership was going to charge me over $100
I originally bought this item because I was hoping for the same scent that Yankee candle produces in their candle line.  The smell is nice, although it doesn't reach out and grab you like true buttercream.  Still, it's nice to shower with and you won't be disappointed with the lather.  I put a quarter sized amount on my shower puff and still had to ring out foam from it after I was finished.  Also, the lather is creamy and it just feels like it is moisturizing your skin.  All in all, I am happy with my purchase.  I only gave 4 stars because I like a stronger scent, but if you like more subtlety I'm sure you'll enjoy it
I bought this Brio train set for my 2 1/2 year old niece over Christmas, and she absolutely loves it!  It's a great starter set and can be expanded with other Brio track sets.  Very easy to put together and the pieces are durable.  Makes a great gift
I love how soft and cuddly this changing pad cover is.  I also appreciate how many colors it comes in. ---  --- What I am disappointed with is the durability.  I have 3 of these and have used them for just over a year.  They are totally falling apart at the elastic. Now, keep in mind that we use disposable "chucks" (those blue hospital disposable under pads) on top of this terry cloth changing pad.  It makes it less messy (especially early on) and doesn't require washing as much.  I also washed them in cold water with Baby Dreft detergent, hung them to dry and rotated the 3 covers that we have.   ---  --- While it is a nice product while it lasts, I just expected them to be more durable. 
Early Louis Malle film based on the true life story of Per Jacques.  The film brings to life an understanding of true martyrdom.  This is the stuff of saints such as Maximilian Kolbe, Edith Stein, and Pere Jacques
I have uninstalled SystemWorks 2006 and will not be going back to Symantec products. I had three problems: ---  --- 1. On initial install of SystemWorks in January 2006, the "GoBack" module wiped my hard drive. This was annoying and not easy to fix. ---  --- 2. I reinstalled (and had to reregister) without the GoBack module and used the software for several months satisfactorily. A few annoyances: CleanUp consistently (every night) deleted cookies and autofills I wanted to keep, so despite my entering them as exceptions in the options table, they kept disappearing. ---  --- 3. I wanted to move to a faster hard drive. After following the Norton Ghost directions explicitly (and getting a "successful" message, the cloned drive would not boot up. I therefore went back to my old drive. SystemWorks required me to reinstall (and reregister). In December, after renewing my SystemWorks subscription for $49.95, I successfully cloned the disk (using EZ Gig II). Again, the only software that did not work on boot up was SystemWorks. I called customer support and was told that the server would not allow me to install on more than 3 computers. I explained the circumstances but was told "there was nothing to be done," and that I would have to buy the software again. I chose not to. ---  --- I have completely uninstalled the entire program and am now enjoying faster performance from the operating system and quicker boot times from Word, Photoshop, etc. The protections I was getting from SystemWorks are being covered by AVG AntiVirus (shareware), Registry Mechanic (shareware), SpyBot (shareware), and DiskKeeper ($30), and Microsoft's Malware Guard (free). ---  --- I have been using Norton/Symantec products for over 15 years. Never again
I have owned a pair of these a year or more and have probably laundered them 30-40 times.  They are very comfortable for me, though comfort is highly variable for each person.  The material is light weight but appears of good quality and I do not detect any deterioriation. At first I was concerned about the elastic which appeared narrow and weak, but it still feels as strong as when new and holds fine.  I will purchase more of these to have in a mix of styles. ---  --- About the same time as I purchased these boxers I purchased a couple pair of Faconnable boxers at about twice the price with similarly light weight material.  One pair of these ripped recently. My experience is the CK material is holding up better than the Facconable that costs twice as much. ---  --- I doubt these will elicit much commentary from significant or potentially significant others
I have been using Norton Anti-Virus since I purchased the Compaq Presario 4000. The reason I have stuck with Norton because this Presario came with Norton Internet Security 2002 attached to it. I never used the NIS 2002, though, but I purchased the Norton Anti-Virus (NAV) 2003 which I have bee using for the last three years. In fact I used the NAV 2004 for two straight years without any response from Symantec, then all of a sudden that subscription was eventually retired by Symantec. I liked the NAV 2005 (which Symantec six months prior to its due date subscription, which made me mad and hence my wanting to try NIS at a subsidized rate) because like NAV 2003, it could tell if someone or something was trying to intrude into your computer. It is after purchasing and trying NIS 2005, that I realized how low and base Norton can go with its software. First when I tried NIS 2005, it blocked all my websites. I couldnt access them and I could not read my e-mail (Whenever I tried to read my e-mail, the response would be that, that action has been cancelled). So I reformatted my hard drive and the NIS 2005 appeared to be working quite well until I tred to install Adobe Reader 7.08 and couldn't allow me to proceed. Moreover, it was snail slow in allowing me to read one mail to another. So I uninstalled NIS 2005 and installed NAV 2006, which appears to be working well. I have now purchased Tend Micro PC-cillin 2006 as well as McAfee Viruscan 2006 at subsidized rates, should Symantec pematurely terminate my NAV 2006 prematurely i.e. before the 366 days of subscription are over. I think one of the reasons why NIS could not work is that it is a program that it is trying to do more than it can chew. It tried to be an anti-virus, personal firewall, privacy control, antispam as well as parental control in one. It reminds of the days when it was better to purchase a cassette player separate from  the radio, since the technology at that time could not produce a good combined raio cassette player. I think Norton Internet Security is in that mode. It is not yet competent to produce a combined solution that is both antivirus and anti spam,anti-spyware at the same time. Hence the many complaints of its being a buggy program. At this stage, I would stay away from any program that calls itself "Internet Security." I may try Trend Micro internet Security which has received rave reviews from a couple of its users, but that will be if something goes wrong with my current NAV 2006. Otherwise, I am still wary of those programs that pass off as "Internet Security" such as "Norton Internet Security" or "Trend Micro Internet Security," pending their perfection of this technology at some future date
Very happy with our camera! Perfect condition and quick arrival
Edited Review:  My first order came with leaking jars.  Amazon replaced and the second order arrived in good condition.  The one star, which I can't seem to change, reflected that fact.  My updated review is three stars. ---  --- I was mildy disappointed in this topping.  Out of the jar, the black olives and the artichokes provide a flavor that has definate sour notes.  The texture of the ingrediants was pasty (as opposed to chunky).  I would have given this only two stars if this was supposed to be a pasta sauce.  However, I followed the directions on the jar to create their version of Bruschetta.  It is acceptable.  Since this is billed as a "topping" I am willing to give it three stars since in that capacity to performs at a pleasurable level. ---  --- The Vodka sauce is much more to my liking. ---  ---  ---  ---  ---         ---  --- 
This razor is not worth the money. It did shave pretty well for a few months, but the rubber strips wear out really quickly. And, even though the "cleaning option" with the fluid seems like a great idea... it does not work very well... the razor was never clean... and refilling the fluid is just a pain... I would not recommend this razor
 I got this movie in a three DVD pack from a local dealer, it came along with the movies Eaten Alive and Massacre in Dinosaur Valley.  I'd have to say that all three movies were worth the $15 dollars I spent on the three-pack.  The movie, Jungle Holocaust, is an adventure movie in a different spin.  I dont really consider this a horror movie, at least in the conventional sense.  The movie is exceptionally well done in the development of cinematography, the storyline is interesting and the acting and er...scenes...are engrossing (to use a phrase).  What I would really call this is an anthropological adventure to the extreme...a civilized man placed in a totally uncivilized surroundings.  Communications are not what you would get off the local street corner, worldviews are nonexistent (at least to the tribe in this film), so there is no connection except savagery.  Maybe this movie would have a greater tie with Golding's "Lord of the Flies."  A fascinating movie that brings you to the heart of a world that we, especially in first world countries like the US, have forgotten about.  I would suggest "End of the Spear" as a Christian look at examining these prehistoric people.  That film isn't a horror film, it is a Christian film, but it is (as I am a Christian) an interesting exploration of meeting such tribal people on their own territory. 
This is probably one of the best booster packs out there. Every monster that comes in the pack has an effect. Effect monsters can be very useful. Not to mention that my very first Pharaonic Guardian pack came with a secret rare! That is one of only two of the most rare cards in the whole pack! Even the common cards are great. Such as Giant axe mummy or the Gravekeeper cards! Your deck cannot be complete without this booster pack! I highly suggest this pack
The medicine ball was ordered for a gift and when it arrived, it was very scuffed up and scratched.  It also had a flat spot on it.  I returned it for a replacement, which I got, and it was in the same condition.  Also the packaging was tore as if it had been opened before.  I  would recommend buying in a store so you can look at it.  We also had the same experience above with the 6 lb. medicine ball and the same outcome.  Definitly not happy with it
Got a dud.  Lights flash (constantly) but not a peep out of it.  Has an email address, wrote for suggestions twice, also no response.  But the mail was delivered so I can only assume they're playing dead (or playing with one that works)!  Big let down
I bought this for my three yr old and it does not work at all.  We have the Britax Roundabout carseat and there is not enough room for the pillow.  I returned it
Even someone who isn't a dedicated/hardcore fan of the Halo series can appreciate the beautiful art and all the work that went into designing this game. Worth every penny
An incredibly refreshing drink when iced! Mix in a teaspoon of honey while your tea is warm and then pour over a generous amount of ice. Because of the ice, use two bags and steep for three minutes or more depending on your taste. You will be pleasantly surprised
the Jo is a popular fighting weapon in the orient.  It doubles as a fancy walking stick and can be displayed in a house as an artifact.  Getting hit with this would probably be like getting hit with a brick because it is approximately an inch in diameter.  this is a long weapon with some weight to it so it is best used for thrusting or using ones own motions against them.  I had a friend who perhaps put it best when he said " I never thought paying 20 bucks for a stick could be such a good deal "
This product is excellent. Has not malfunctioned like some other brands where info becomes inaccessible after some time. --- Good perfromanc
I bought this album after hearing America, their single off this album, and listening to the increasing hype about Razorlight and Johnny Borrell being one of the most talented singer-songwriters of his generation. This follow up is a thorough disappointment compared to their first. It's not bad, but it's not that good either. The songs all sound like I've heard them somewhere before, and the lyrics - well, how many times have we heard popstars going on about waiting by the phone, nothing on the radio, and not known what it all meant, while smoking cigarettes late at night. Yawn...
Im no Pro but once you get these bongos and tune them, they sound nice. I jam on them all the time and the quality gets better and better as the skins thin out, the sound comes out a lot more. Definitely worth 20 bucks
I live in a apt in nyc, so roaches are very common problem. After a long battle I finally got rid of the roaches in my place, but I cannot escape the bugs visiting from other apartments. I thought this device could help with that problem. Also, I don't like to use the spray too often or have all the baits, gels, and other poisons around, so I decided to try these things. Unfortunately, they don't work. The first week I bought them I saw a big roach crawl under the door and walk directly under the repeller straight to the dining room. The ultrasonic frequency did nothing to it. Instead of this repeller I use Limonel (orange peel oil) is a safe alternative to use when children are present, and it does repell and kill the bugs. --- So, how to get rid of roaches? Seal every crack nook and cranny with expansive foam, wood sealer, etc. Mine came in through the bathroom and kitchen vents, so I put mosquito screens to block their way in, also I sealed the gaps between the wall and the electrical outlets in the apt with silicone and I bought a plastic stripe that closes the gap between the door and the floor. Also, my husband sprays once every 4 months with repellent. Good luck
I found this CD by browsing Amazon and decided to give it a try.  I am happy with all of the tracks.  Some tracks remind me of Beatles a little, but not all, so the band does have a unique sound.  Even though from the 90s, the sound is like many bands making it today.  I like it.
I can't believe how much amazon and other retail stores (like sephora)charge for this.  I buy Prevage MD (which is double the strength of regular Prevage) from my plastic surgeon's office and I only pay 120$.  Why would you pay 30 dollars more for something that is only half the strength of the good stuff?  If you don't want to go to the doctor to buy the MD version, then you can get it off ebay for around 100$..
A playground for the mind. Covers a wide range of subjects. Each review is a full essay on the subject of the book. Many reviews compare and contrast several recently published books on the same subject. Learned and sophisticated yet fully accessible. An on-going liberal arts education and the easiest way I know to keep the eclectic learning that a liberal arts education aspires to
American Photo is a much better magazine than its sibling Popular Photography, but frankly, that is not saying much. It seems as though its primary market is fashion/glamour photographers since most of its issues are devoted to these aspects of professional photography. There are other magazines which excel at nature photography, so I am not disappointed by its absence here, but not noting more fine art documentary photograhy is a major omission which I hope this magazine does address eventually. There are also excellent photo equipment reviews frequently written by working professionals, as opposed solely to in-house technical equipment overviews. American Photo is without question among the better photo magazines currently available, but unless you are interested mainly in fashion and glamour photography, you might wish to look more closely at Shutterbug or other magazines devote to nature and fine art photography
First off. The knife is great. I wouldn't expect anything less from swiss army. only bad part about the knife is that the altimeter has an accuracy error margin of about 75%. And since this is both the title of the knife and the main feature of it, I give the knife a two. Only because you can get a knife just like it without the altimeter that works just as well. 
Considering you get at least twice as much jerky per dollar than the other brands out there this is a good pick.  I didn't find any grit in it.  It might have a few pieces that are tougher but not really even that tough.  This is a good deal
I'm not a good photographer but use my cameras for vacation/backpacking pictures.  The P3 was the fourth point and shoot Nikon camera my family has owned.  One of the previous cameras had the lens quit woking probably because it got some dirt in it.  On the P3 the lens extends out pretty far when the camera is turned on.  I accidently dropped it from about 30" off the ground when it was only a few days old.  It landed on the back but flipped over on to the lens.  The outer ring of the lens ended up crooked and would not retract or focus. I sent it back to Nikon and as I expected they said the repair would not be covered by warranty.  They charged $162.50 to fix it.  MasterCard has a program called "Purchase Assurance" that will hopefully cover the repair cost!   ---  --- The other night I saw a commercial on TV for an Olympus camera that could be dropped from 5 feet, get wet, or even frozen down to 14 degrees F and still take pictures.  I wish I had seen that ad first.   --- The Nikon takes great pictures but is way too fragile for a small point and shoot camera.  Not buying Nikon anymore. 
I RECEIVED A CD, THE TANGO CD( THE BEST TANGO ALBUM IN THE WORLD EVER) WAS DEFECTUOUS, SINCE IT PLAYS ALRIGHT  UNTIL THE 12TH SONG, BUT THEN THE SONGS STARTS GIVING WEIRD TONES. AND THE 2ND CD ACTS THE SAME WAY, SINCE MY TANGO ALBUM IS A DOUBLE CD.THE PROBLEM IS NOT FROM THE RADIO, SINCE MY OTHER PURCHASE FROM AMAZON IS IN GOOD SHAPE, AS AL MY OTHER CDS. --- THE MUSIC ALWAYS STOPS PLAYING RIGHT AT THE SAME TIME OF THE CD, THE 12 TH SONG, SO ITS PRETTY MUCH A CD PROBLEM. --- I DUNNO WHATS THE REFUND POLICY, OR CUSTOMER SERVICE NUMBER, ITS SO BAD , COS THIS TANGO CD IS GREAT. I ENJOYED IT MUCH , UNTIL......... --- TH
Most people can't get enough of this movie. I even own it on laserdisc. When I saw that there was a 20th anniversary edition availible on DVD, I had to have it. --- I am sorely disappointed in the video transfer quality. It lookslike there was just a transfer from VHS to DVD. There doesn't seem to be any attempt to remaster the video and clear it up or improve the audio quality. I recently saw it on HDNet Movies and thought it looked much better. ---  --- DO buy this movie because it is an all time classic. --- Don't buy this movie if you think that the 20th Anniversary edition is going to get you anything better
Marvel: Ultimate Alliance is an action/RPG that features the largest roster of comic book characters ever seen in a video game. Players assume the roles of more than 20 Marvel Super Heroes including Spider-Man, Wolverine, Blade and Captain America, and through their actions determine the fate of both planet Earth and the Marvel universe ? revealed in one of multiple epilogues.  ---  --- Marvel: Ultimate Alliance offers total team customization, where players create their own team name, icon and vehicle, as well as establish their team reputation as they play throughout the story. Gamers also have the option to level up each character individually to their liking, or all team members at the same time to keep their heroes balanced. With the game's new combat system, players battle against the world's most notorious Marvel Super Villains in the air, underwater, and on the ground, using grappling, blocking and dodging moves, by charging up their Super Hero powers before unleashing them, and using environmental objects as one and two-handed weapons. Marvel: Ultimate Alliance features a storyline where the missions players accept, the objectives they complete, and their interactions with other characters throughout the game directly impact how the story plays out.  ---  --- 
I bought this chair because of the great reviews, I hesitated at spending so much, but figured that all the features would be worth it considering my son would be using it for a couple of years.  --- Pros: --- I like that I can roll it around to the table, or to the sink to clean up after meals. The height adjustment is easy and convenient.  --- The cons: --- Folding it up didn't quite work as I thought it would. It didn't lock into the folding postition...and didn't really save that much space. I would prop it against the wall, and hope that no one knocked it down. We finally stopped folding it up. The toys that connect to the tray were too dangerous for my son, as he would usually hit himself in the face with them when he was younger, by the time he was older, I didn't really need them. The battery operated toy has a funny smell to it whenever it's been running for a while. He did like it...but the buttons were too hard for him to press when he was younger. My son discovered at 7 months how to pull off the extra tray that can go into the dishwasher, so we don't use that. He's 13 months now, and last week discovered how to disconnect the tray itself and fling it off of the high chair. I washed the seat cover per the instructions, and half the time did not use the dryer, even though it said it could go into the dryer, and now the seat is bubling and cracking...I have to place a cloth diaper in the seat to protect my son's legs. If I had not spent $90.00 on the chair I would not be as disappointed...but he's only used it for 7 months.
I read this book several months ago, and I still can't shake the feeling of having read a very, very good book. The effect of Yourcenar's words still lingers. ---  --- The text is an imagined valedictory letter or speech from emperor Hadrian to his successor. The emperor himself is dying, and faces a world that he is about to leave behind. He recalls his life, from being a young boy in his native Spain, to his ascension to the highest public post imaginable, that of emperor of Rome. Just as his professional career was incredible, so is the generosity and candidness of his "confession". There is seemingly no secret nook left untouched from his personal life.  ---  --- In the end, having cast that final weight, his conscience, from off his shoulders, the emperor is at last able to turn away from one world and face another - that of the gods.    --- 
I purchased these about 1 month ago and used the "burn in" method of leaving my Grado running music for 6 days straight to open up the components in the headphones for good sound and was VERY impressed. I do have to say that they are a bit uncomfortable at first but its worth it for the good sound and the fact that the pads adjust and soften up after a while. It's also no where near as painful as my ordeal with my first pair of canalphones which were the E2c's(see my other reviews). ---  --- Anyways...on the subject of sound I have to say that its an all around winner with its smooth but punchy bass and its open soundstage which I guess results from the open ear design they have, and although some don't like the retro look of these phones I've really been gettin into them as of late, another big plus are the rotating cups and the thick cable which guarantee's a long life for these cans. I also gotta give Grado credit on it's expandability with amps and different cups which will leave me hunting  for new components seeing as I'm merely just a budding audiophile with a long way to go and a limited budget that wont let me upgrade my setup whenever I want(cries)... ---  --- P.S. ---  --- If you use these with your computer and there are pops and hisses its because the Grado are too good for the card which resulted in me buying a new 24bit external sound card from creative that gave me a REAL boost in sound quality. So overall these are a good pair of cans for someone who loves their music but just can't afford to buy the latest and greatest in the world of sound
People are always focusing on the 2%, but what about the 98%? ---  --- I mean, really....98% is like a 790 on the SAT or an A+ in school or a 3.99 on a 4.00 scale. A 98 is really, really good....just like this milk, the 128 oz. of Tuscan 2% milk in the plastic jug. ---  --- But you gotta wonder about the price, I mean, they get the cream for the butter right? You gave up some of your whole milk delights for someone else's butter so I think we should get a price break or something. Or maybe some kind of gift certificate when Tuscan Butter is finally available online
We've had this printer for almost two years. I do a good amount of printing, both color & b/w. While I do need to do cleanings more often with this printer, mine is not sucking up ink at an unreasonable rate at all. And it is very affordable. Photos don't always print well... the only photo paper I have found to work well with my S530D was very the glossy trial pack that came with it when I bought it. No other photo paper has done well at all, so I suggest theirs. This is the best printer we have had in 10 years, and belive me I've thrown my share out the window! I can offer THIS advice to owners of ANY printers. Always use the power switch ON THE PRINTER to turn it on off, never use the power strip switch, or the switch from properties. For some reason doing so supposedly wastes ink? I don't get it, but I've always followed that advice and this printer has been an absolute gem for us. Good Luck! Jeanni
I love this soundtrack! It stands alone as beautiful, haunting, alluring, and innocent--just as Griet herself was in the film. Desplat perfectly captured the spirit of the story, enhanced and deepened a plot that was less than stellar. ---  --- Scarlett Johanssen's acting is superb, as well as Essie Davis and Colin Firth. The story, though, was a bit tired--pretty housemaid/jealous wife/do-nothing husband. Its portrayal of Vermeer and his wife was a disservice to the real people, even though it is a fictionalized account. ---  --- The two best tracks on this album are 'Griet's Theme' and 'Colours in the Clouds'. While I'm not keen on seeing the film again, this soundtrack is a treasure. It's a real work of art, second only to Vermeer's work
Obviously, from all the reviews, this book appeals to many people.  I am not one of them.  Perhaps it's because I don't care for science fiction.  I found the writing stilted, the footnotes distracting to the point I stopped bothering with them, the story boring, and the ending (covered in the introduction) to be a Twilight Zone cliche.  If, like me, you want to read the book because it has some connection to bicycles and cycling you will be disapppointed. 
This is my favorite cereal, I recommend it to everyone I can.  I eat a bowl every morning at 9 am and am still full at lunch time.  Best of all, it tastes great.  I agree with previous reviewer that the flax seeds are tasty, but probably useless as the body can't break down a whole flax seed to obtain the Omega-3, but it adds nice texture and nuttiness.  Also, Amazon has a great price on this vs. grocery stores
The plot of the story was ruined by the immorality and language.   This could have been a beautiful story if sexual immorality and profane language had been eliminated.   It is possible to have something beautiful and clean where when you finish you feel that you have experienced something encouraging and uplifting.   Dying Young and the plot of sickness and someone caring is beautiful.  Falling in love is beautiful but it is degraded by stooping to immorality.   I threw it in the trash as I would not share it with those that I love
The overall package is well built and well documented.  The installation was straightforward and only took about 30 minutes to get up and running.  It does work, but, if you are like me, most of your tapes are getting pretty old and are not in the greatest of shape, sound-wise. Because the software lacks any capabilities to perform sound leveling and noise reduction, your resulting .mp3s that are all over the place, sound-wise. ---  --- As a cheap work-around, get the WindowsXP Plus! Digital Media Edition.  The Analog Recorder works well enough and is simple to use.  Plus it is only $15 to download.  You can use it with the plusdeck to play your tapes and provide input and then use the analog Recorder to actually record the files and convert to .mp3.  If you get a tape player with a line out, you can connect your tape player right to the back of your computer and accomplish the same without the Plusdeck2c
Noam Chomsky has thrived greatly in this great country of his, yours, and mine - the United States of America.  He has made millions of dollars teaching, lecturing, selling his books, and investing.  His world-wide fame in psycholinguistics is well-deserved.  His infamy is merited for his lack of loyalty to his own Jewish ethnicity and the U.S., in spite of the fruits he has received by being a citizen of the United States.  He has repaid this country in bile with his incredibly biased analysis of American foreign policy.  He goes way beyond a balanced multiculturism, when he always ranks the U.S. and Israel as foremost among the terrorist forces in the world now, and even in history.  His distrust of any authority, benign or otherwise, is reflected in his dogmatic and unexamined support of the "underdog," even if that underdog is a suicide bomber or a major terrorist organization such as Al Queda or Hezbollah.   ---  --- Yet since 1955, hypocrite Chomsky has worked for the "overdog" Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which has actively and enthusiastically participated in the development of weapons of War and mass destruction, and continues to this very day. ---  --- Chomsky trumps his own potential for gifted analytic objectivity with his simple hatred of the United States and the Jewish State. ---  --- If he were not so attached to the freedom of making money, earning the adulation of the American Left, and freedom to express himself, he might be able to give more direct and personal support for our enemies and his friends by taking up residence in North Korea, Iran, or Syria.  Let us hope he retires outside of our homeland that he hates so much, the United States of America.   ---  --- God Bless America, which will continue to give Chomsky the right to speak, teach, and make lots of money. ---  --- Raybo
I love the xbox 360,I got it about 2 months ago.I remember my friend saying wait for the ps3,i told him im not waiting for that overhyped overpriced system.The xbox 360 live is amazing and is so much fun.The graphics and sound are great to.I dont have an hd tv either but you can tell a great deal of difference(you need real cables people.dont use the cheap ones that come with it and use the components not the stupid yellow video plug).The wireless controllers are great.the main thing are games,theres good ones and bad ones,choose very wisely.But there alot of good ones right now to choose from.And make sure you get the xbox with the 20 gig hard drive,theres no other way to have it
I just love our snack trap cups!  My 19 month old has been using them for 4 or 5 months and enjoys "doing it himself".  They're great for shopping, driving, or anywhere!  ABSOLUTELY NO SPILLS!  Highly reccommend this product! ---  --- -Happy mom of 1 so fa
The musical was a virtual voyage back to my childhood when I saw it for the first time. My husband is no "square" and he enjoyed it all. Seniors would love to see it again.  The film was obviously preserved well and the color was enriched beautifully for this dvd
This thing is great. Anything you can put on top of it to hold it down will stage it up to go off. It will blow up and not hurt anyone but scare them...funny funny funny!!!! You can use fairly light objects, you can use trip cords, and you can use trip cord like devices too, and probably much more that I have never thought of... Good luck, good fun, and good hunting! ---  --- Sam Kochel... ---  --- p.s. hope this was a helpful review
My husband is Icelandic, and unfortunately this book was NO help at all... It's perfectly fine for the traveller, but in trying to live everyday life, conversing with new family members forget it. I would have liked to have seen a more comprehensive grammatical section, something that was laid out in something easy to look at and understand. If you are quite serious about learning this language I would honestly recommend saving the 20 bucks and buying the bit more expensive Colloquial Icelandic.  For me at least, it's quite easier to understand, has complete grammatical charts in the back, as well as a fairly decent dictionary...  Again, if you are only learning for business trips and such, then this would be a good option... For those of us actually moving there, her book is not so good..
I don't know where Amazon got these cases of All Small & Mighty, Free Clear.  I use the same product all the time purchased from my local superstores and grocery stores and love it.  From my local retailers the product has no scent and is the consistency of shampoo.  The Amazon case is gelatinous and smells like latex paint.  It also disturbed me that the bottles are packaged differently than the local store version.  At the store they have a shrink wrap label and a large cap for a dripless spout.  The Amazon case has sticker labels on the same shape bottle and a small cap on a non-dripless spout.  At first I called the manufacturer.  Their customer service seemed concerned but then managed to drop my call.  So I decided to use it.  I do not notice any difference in the cleanliness level of my clothes.   ---  --- I would not purchase this again from Amazon.  The price is not that great to overcome the odd differences.  I will, however, continue to purchase this product from my local retailers
Coat was of VERY cheap quality. The fur around hood was matted. No way I would wear or recommend this coat.  It went staight to Good Will. I guess you get what you pay for.  Unless it is free you are paying too much
This door gym is incredible. I have been getting great workouts with this. My arms, chest, back, and shoulders have all been noticably improved within a week. Great workout. Throw in a few miles of running and you have no excuse not to be ready for summer
Great set of earrings at a very nice price.  Thanks
Tales from the crypt as you might know is the popular horror series that was on HBO during the early ninties so this film is the first movie to be made from that series. The film is absolutley fantastic and has alot of gore, nudity and humor in it unfortunately the sequal that was released after this was terrible and wasn't even worth it anyway the film starts of with a small segment where the cryptkeeper is directing a horror film then tells his usual stuff like some lame jokes then the real film starts with a car chase and offcourse Billy Zane as the collector was fantastic in his role he was hillarious and scary at the same time, William Sadler plays Brayker who is a drifter that stumbles upon a motel and its inhabitants and is trying to hide from the collector who happens to want a medalion that Brayker has, the collecter also summons up some demons from hell in a very cool scene so he could create alot of havoc, the film was also an homage to older horror films like the evil dead and night of the living dead as you'll see later when the characters are all stuck in this motel surrounded by demons. All the characters were great in this film and you also get a bit of background with each one of them which is rare especialy in a gory horror film like this. The film also stars Jada Pinket Smith, CCH Pounder who gets her arm ripped off in this film and Thomas Haden Church who plays the obnoxious jerk and some other actors that I don't recognise all this makes for a great and enjoyable horror film that I highly recomend that you watch
I think coffee taste is more of a personal preference, but I was not fond of this decaf coffee.  I always drink my coffee black and I didn't get the rich coffee taste that I like with the Don Francisco brand.  Illy has a great reputation so I am guessing their non-decaf coffee is outstanding, they just need a little work with the decaf
The author not only argues for feminism, but she does so in a unique manner, and innovative approach by arguing for feminism across borders.  She compares and defines literary and national borders.  This book is extremely thorough on all aspects of Chicana feminist writing available, by engaging historical theories as well as contemporary notions.  To really grasp the experience, the author has certainly covered her basis in terms of depth, substance, truth and validity.  
I am 23 years old and this game hasn't left my DS since I bought it a month ago. It's incredibly fun. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes fast paced minigames. You get rated bronze, silver, or gold for your cooking. I love these weird japanese games! I only gave it 4 stars overall because there is not a lot of replay value once you have received gold on all 74 or so recipes. I heard they are making a Wii version of cooking mama, so I'm hoping that one will have more recipes
we bought this when my daughter was newborn, and we were surprised that her peg perego car seat fit into it so well, now shes a year and a half and even if were at home she climbs into it and plays with the steering wheel. She has always loved it, in the snow and on the ground and on picnics, its great, a lot better than plastic wheels, the front tire swivels and also has a little switch so that it becomes more like a jogging stroller and the front wheel doesnt move. Weve really liked it so far, except for the harness not fitting a very tiny baby, its GREAT. the only thing is now i have 2 kids and i cant use it cause i need a double on
My husband liked his slippers I got him for Christmas.  He said that they were warm and soft
So far the device has entirely lived up to expectations.  Atomic Clock feature works fine and the range and accuracy on the remote sensor seems fair enough -- there is often about a 1-2 degree difference between the sensor and main unit if set right next to each other, but this is minor for the uses we get out of it (a quick look at outside temps during the winter). ---  --- The only issue we ran into that was "problematic" was the Ice Alarm feature.  This feature sets off the devices alarm anytime the temperature drops between 32 and 27 degrees or so to alert you to possible icy conditions.  The problem is that in cold climates the temperature hovers in that range all winter long...so the alarm goes off continually every 40 seconds or so. ---  --- We just happened upon a solution that has worked perfectly.  The ice alarm only works on Channel 1.  So, if you set the outside sensor to Channel 2 or 3 the ice alarm is disabled and is no longer triggered.  Obviously, they should have an ability to shut it off, but this is it...and even this isn't listed in the instructions
We bought this camera thinking that it would be our do-all "EuroCam" for an upcoming trip to Europe. It promised a sufficient range of performance and features to easily meet our needs on such a trip. ---   --- Sadly, the camera is not up to filling this role. We will need to take another camera along with it. However, we will take the V705 for its wide-angle lens, the reason that we picked this model in the first place. It is this disparity between the advertised and actual capabilities of the camera which prompts me to contribute this review. ---  --- The need for a true wide-angle lens is both a sufficient and a necessary condition for buying this camera. If you do not need a 23mm lens, or if you do not know if you need a 23mm lens, then you do not need this otherwise mediocre P&S (Point and Shoot) camera.  ---  --- Good: Fairly decent 23mm wide-angle lens; The 23mm is the default lens; Rapid start-up time; Internal focus and zoom; Chromatic aberration well controlled; Can use 4GB cards; Freeze-frame and extract any video frame. ---  --- Mediocre: Soft images; Perceptible shutter lag; Slow shot-to-shot times; Exposure compensation is easy, but steps are too small for digital, and is reset when camera turned off; Flash does not come close to covering the 23mm; Image numbering basically limited to 4 digits; Flimsy construction; No manual controls; No RAW format; No optical viewfinder; Histogram on display, but too small to be useful. ---  --- Bad: The Absolute Worst menu system to be found on a camera; Excessive and unadjustable JPEG compression; Poor battery life with very expensive external charger and spare battery; Unacceptable visual noise starting at ASA-400; Forced in-camera stitching of panoramic images, with inability to save the individual panoramic shots; Panoramic component images forced to 5MP; Overlays for panoramic and delete modes are so dark they obscure the underlying image (even with display on `bright'); MPEG-4 video compression gives very poor results. ---  --- Synopsis: ---  --- If you need a 23mm lens in a point and shoot, this, and the older V570, are the only choices. ---  --- If most of your images are in bright light, the 7MP V705 gives better images. If most images will be in low light, the older, cheaper, 5MP V570 is the better choice. ---   --- The camera seems very fragile. Treat it gently and you will likely be happy with the wide-angle performance. If you chose this as your sole camera, you will likely be unhappy with your choice. ---  --- The ONLY reason to buy this camera is for the wide-angle lens.  ---  --- = = = = =  Some Expanded Comments  = = = = = ---  --- Twenty-three mm wide-angle fixed-focus lens. This lens has almost decent optical quality; though the camera's processing still produces overly-compressed and soft images from it. On power-up the 23mm is the initially active lens, which is ideal for us. However, considering that this is truly a specialty lens, it would make more sense that the `normal' lens should be the default. Best would be a menu setting to allow selection of the boot-up lens. Better yet would be a camera with only the 23mm lens. ---  --- The camera does have firmware wide-angle distortion correction. This works fairly well, at the cost of even more image softness, but even-so, barrel distortion is noticeable to a degree that is not present in actual 35mm-film camera wide-angle lenses of similar focal length. This in-camera correction can be turned off. Doing so allows one to see the marginal native lens performance. ---  --- However, being able to turn off distortion correction exemplifies for me how poorly thought out this camera is. The only people who would wish to do this are those who are exploring the artistic limits of the camera - and they would seem better served by the camera having such basics as:  manual settings, a physically larger sensor chip, RAW image files, or, at least, a choice of degree of JPEG compression. ---  --- At the other end of the camera's focal length the 114/117mm performance shows slightly below average image softness with average pincushion distortion. There are very few circumstances where one would want to use `digital zoom', so, as with all digicams, the claimed maximum telephoto length is completely bogus. After reaching optical zoom limits, one is much better off doing any further 'zooming' in an editing program. ---  --- Kodak's advertised "5X Optical Zoom" is, at best, misleading. Actually, it is just flat out untrue. The camera has two lenses. The only lens that can be optically zoomed is the 39-114mm lens, which is not quite 3:1. The wide angle lens has a fixed focal length. (Note, in some places Kodak claims 39-114, in others 39-117 optical zoom.) ---   --- Also misleading is the claimed "Anti-blur technology." As best I can tell from looking at the images, and at the EXIF metadata, all this actually means is that at some given shutter speed the camera boosts the ASA. Certainly there is no optical image stabilization technology in this camera. ---  --- Speaking of ASA. This is an opportune time to address the camera's incredibly poor menu system. It is Byzantine: being both awkward and time consuming to use. To adduce, `Auto' ASA ranges from 50-200, to set a faster (or to lock in at a slower) sensitivity rating requires going through multiple menu levels. To change from `auto' to the next fastest (400) requires 11 manipulations of 2 controls! On either of the other two P&Ss which we will be taking along it requires 4 pushes on 1 control. The menu system is next to unusable in the field. ---  --- Still on ASA settings, the camera does have sensitivities up to ASA/ISO 1000 (though the manual only documents ASAs up to 800, 1000 is available on the camera). Unless your shot is of a once-in-a-lifetime, will never-happen-again moment, then 200 is the max ASA tolerable before noise in the shadows becomes annoying. At 400 the entire image suffers from noise and is not really useable for any print larger than 4x5". ---  --- The previous version of this camera, V570, had only 5MP, but the same sensor size. By increasing the pixel count, but not the physical size of the sensor, the new V705 camera actually has more low-light digital noise than its predecessor. This has happened with many of the current P&S cameras, as the makers advertise pixel count as a measure of image quality.  My initial experience with low-light high ASA use of this camera is that you might as well set the capture size to 3 MP, as the larger files have only marginally better printing capability because of the severe noise artifact. ---  --- Another approach to dealing with the sensor noise is to use one of the commercially available products which, when calibrated to the sensor in the camera, allows the subtraction of much of the internally generated noise. Doing so does allow for semi-adequate 8x10" prints at ASA 800. If one really wants to get carried away, combining the preceding with any of the image stacking programs designed for astrophotography (where dozens/hundreds/thousands of images are averaged together) makes 8x10's at ASA 1000 doable. People willing to undertake these manipulations likely do not fit Kodak's target market. ---  --- Back to earth. ---  --- The V705's still-image quality is below average for this generation of 7MP P&S cameras. Mostly I believe this is because of the overly aggressive JPEG compression, which is not adjustable (e.g. `best', `good', etc). My guess is that a compression setting of 30-40 is being used. This results in small files, with a lot of compression artifact. The 7MP JPEGs from this camera are about 1.2-1.5MB in size, those from another 7MP P&S I have are 5-6MB. My 6MP prosumer digital SLR JPEGs are 8-10MB. The more the compression, the worse the image. Most cameras allow the user to pick the trade-off point. Kodak picks it for you, and picks poorly. ---  --- The V705's video performance is very disappointing. It uses MPEG-4 compression, and at very aggressive compression settings. Unless it is a video of your baby's first steps, or aliens landing in the backyard, you will likely find it hard to watch. The total output datastream is about 0.5 MBS. Compare this with a miniDV tape video datastream of 25 MBS (total, adding sound, error correction, and time codes, is 36 MBS). Better to have stuck with MPEG-2 which would give less compression, but decent enough (TV quality) videos. That is the choice that most manufactures have made. As a result, the videos from my other P&Ss have about a 2 MBS datastream, and so are of much better quality. ---  --- The battery. Kodak's claim is 150 still images per charge. I am getting 100-120, with minimal use of flash and the LCD on `energy saver'. Even 150 would be poor, compared with my other digital P&Ss, where I expect at least 200, and often get 250+ if I am at all careful with power-management. This camera has a proprietary (and hard to remove) 720 mAh battery. My (several) other, P&Ss have 790-1120 mAh batteries, and, I suspect, more efficient processors. ---  --- Since we are only going to be using this camera for wide-angle, the battery will likely last most of a day. We have not bought an external charger and backup battery because the cost is about 25% the cost of the camera. ---  --- Though the body is of aluminum, the camera itself is overall fragile and I doubt will hold up more than a year or two. The battery and media doors do not appear to have been designed for actual repeated use; there is no cover for the charge socket. The media door often dislodges open. ---  --- Truly, my belief is that Kodak designed this camera with the thought that these doors would never be used: that the camera would spend its life simply being taken in and out of the (not included in this model) "EasyShare" dock system. This would also explain the relatively large amount of built in memory, and the overly aggressive JPEG compression. ---  --- Shutter lag, the bête noire of digital cameras, is very evident with this model. I do not have any method of actually measuring the time between pressing the shutter, and the image being recorded. However, based on over 50 years of tripping shutters, it clearly varies, and I estimate is, at best 1/4  second, up to a bit over 1/2 second. In addition to the shutter lag, there is a perceptible lag in the LCD viewfinder screen showing what is in front of the lens. Together this makes the capture of a fleeting moment, an active child at a particular instant, or a wary animal almost impossible. The shutter lag is much more evident than in same-generation/price P&S cameras from other makers. ---  --- The accompanying `manual' is poorly organized, childishly written. "Finish reading this book, so you can take and share your best pictures!"  At best, it was written for 8 year olds. ---  --- The manual does make reference to a web-address where one can download the `full manual', however the address given is incorrect. When eventually found, the manual is better than the one enclosed with the camera - in that it contains some information that one could not figure out oneself - but it also is written at no more than a fourth grade level. ---  --- Panoramics, one of the advertising points of the camera, are another disappointment. Basically the way it works is that 2 or 3 images can be taken in `panoramic mode', each subsequent shot is overlain by a thin strip of the preceding image, in order to allow alignment. As with most `panoramic modes' focus and exposure is locked on the first image. So far, this is all OK; however, it rapidly goes downhill. ---  --- First, the max image size of the individual shots is limited to 5 (not 7) MP. Next, the image overlay is so dark that, even with the LCD set at max brightness, it is difficult to see through the mask to align the elements. ---  --- However, it gets worse. ---  --- The images MUST be joined in-camera! The individual images cannot be stored! In-camera processing is very slow and very battery hungry. Aligning the overlaps on a grainy 1.5x2" LCD in the field gives, in spite of the camera's best efforts, much poorer results than aligning them on a much bigger, and higher quality, computer display in the comfort and controlled lighting of your home. ---  --- The best way to take panoramas with this camera is to use a lightmeter to determine exposure for each segment, and then simply take the appropriate series of images as 7MP single-stills, making exposure compensation adjustments based on your light-meter readings. Of course, my smallest lightmeter is almost as large as this camera, so we will not be dragging it along. You can eyeball the needed EC close enough that should be able to match the exposures up in production. Much better if the V705 allowed the individual images to be saved. ---  --- Reading back through this review, I see that it is mostly negative. This makes sense, for, as I disclosed at the beginning, it was my disappointment in this camera's actual vs advertised capability which led me to write the review in the first place. Likely I have said all that needs to be said. ---  --- So I will just close by mentioning that the only reason we did not send the camera back is because of the wide-angle lens.  Except for this unique lens, the camera's performance and ease of use is below that of similarly priced P&S cameras currently on the market. ---  --- If you need a true wide-angle P&S, you need this camera. Otherwise forget it
this has a nice wide color screen with amazing clarity and picture quality.  Syncs to Windows PC and MS Office with ease.  Great feature is the off phone battery recharging and the included second battery.  Having one battery to recharge and using the other until the phone dies should keep the life of the battery longer.  Not having to worry about plugging in to recharge is totally awesome.  Nice to see this feature return.  When cellphone first came out this was a standard feature, then it was optional, then it was gone.  Get the extra long life battery if you plan to use this as a video or MP3 music player.  Video conversion is a bit spotty and frustrating.  Many videos will convert and then not display.  Music is no problem.  Any MP3 or MS Windows media player audio format will play.  Convert is easy with Windows Media Player 10 or 11.  Sorry Win2k users (forget NT or Win9X or Me), video conversion is not available on any MS OS older than XP and Windows Media Player 10 and 11 are only on XP.  Get a MicroSD card and put your music on that card and you can play it from there.  Pictures can also be stored on the SD card or in the 64Megs of internal memory.  Since this is a MS Smartphone, there are lots of 3rd party software and games for this phone.  Be aware of the aspect ratio, this is a landscape display and not portrait.  If you get games or applications for it be  sure of the aspect ratio.  This is a 240H by 320W display.  Size your pictures to the display and you will be happy with the clarity and sharpness.  ---  --- The thumbwheel is great for navigation and web browsing. ---  --- Niggles: --- 1. Camera is slow and not very clear, but none of the camera phones I have seen are very good either. --- 2. need more ring tones. The ones that come with this phone are lame at best.  Download or create some of your own. --- 3. Need more menu choices.  The ones that come with it are OK but take some navigation to get around. --- 4. Hate the Cingular activation policy and cost for the internet access service (but that is not the phone's fault so maybe I should not list this complaint)
This is a really fun and fashionable watch.  It has a bangle style band and can be worn slightly loose or snug.  I like the pink dial that changes color.  Depending on the angle and lighting, the dial looks pink, yellow or purple.  I also like how Fossil made the band adjustable.  Remove or add as many links as necessary.  There is no need to have the watch adjusted at the jewelry counter
This movie was ok. I do prefer The Messenger starring Milla Jovovich. Milla is exceptional in that version
  --- This game is mindnumbingly hard not because its a very challenging but rather its set up to fail.Most missions thrust you into a situation with little indication of what to do. As the patients vital signs drops, you frantically poke at your DS trying to think on what to do. The nurse, who assists you, gives you vague ideas on how and before you know it you've failed the mission. It would take me an average of 10-15 failures before I finally won a mission. The last mission I played that made me quit, resulted in 30+ failures. And that's only being 1 hour and half into the game.  ---  --- The graphics are crisp and clear. The storyline didn't make much of an impression on me. But I was probably too frustrated to pay attention to that. This game had a lot of potiental but killed it by constantly making you fail. Do not buy this game unless you have an extreme amount of patients, game collector who will keep it sealed, or you're a gultton for punishment. Whatever you do, do not buy this game for the hype. It does not live up to it. 
I am completely satisfied with this product.  Correct time is kept and it has been a great watch.  I have had many atomic wrist watches and this is the best one ever. 
The external antenna is a plastic decoration only and does not do anything functional.  False advertising
I have studied the tarot for nearly 5 years and keep an open mind whenever a new book appears on the market.  Edain McCoy, who has written some wonderful New Age material, strikes an off-putting note in this one.  The spreads are certainly imaginative and are perhaps insightful to her own method of tarot interpretation, but convey confusing and ambiguous directions to the reader who is trying to understand her card placements.  In several of her spreads she conveys that a card's placement at a certain point in the spread "may or may not" mean some karmic element at play.  The whole exercise of creating a spread is to pinpoint with a degree of accuracy the situation you wish to define.  Therefore, when a card "may or may not" mean something, that interpretation could significantly change on whether you "may or may not" interpret it that way, leaving the interpreter open to rationalizing a card's meaning.  Tarot cards are intuitive, not rational, and their meanings can best be intuited when their placement is clearly defined without ambiguity   It is difficult to have it both ways and I found working with these spreads difficult.  Imagine doing a Celtic Cross reading and the first position "may or may not" be the root of the issue.  These spreads speak very clearly to the author, but not so to the reader.  I rate it 2 stars for depth and insight into Karma and past lives, but the explanations are too ambiguous.
I really like the heart rate monitor and it works great.  As has been said, it takes some time learning all it does, but it's worth it in my opinion.  The only thing I was not real excited about was the pace jumps around quite a bit, but from what I have been told by others and their brands of running watches, they all do this to an extent.  Everything else I'm quite happy with and would highly recommend it to anyone. The distance reading has been right on the money after calibration.
This school bus was smaller than I expected, about 4 inches long. I bought it for my 3 year old son who loves school buses. He broke it in the first 5 minutes of opening the package. It's a pull-back and go car. And he pulled it back too far on the first try and it snapped the wheels. They were wobbly from then on. This toy is not for kids and it's not really for playing with from what I can tell. Very dissappointed
when i first stepped on the scale i thought i lost 10 lbs. but after reading other review i realize the scale  is off up to 9  lbs. also this is a big scale. too big to store in the bathroo
I don't know why they changed from the old layout to the new skinny vertical columns. The old planner was a lifesaver, but this new layout is unusable. They claim to be the artist's notebook, but what artist is really going to be breaking their day down hour by hour? And even if someone wanted to do that, the tiny columns are worthless. Really a shame
I'm a college kid, recreational audiophile and bass fanatic, studying engineering.  I started off building a custom sub encloser with dual Kicker CompVR 12" subs driven by a 1200W Sony amp. I haven't stopped searching for great sound since. ---  --- I'm running a pair of these off an H/K AVR240, combined with a JBL EC35 center, a JBL S120PII 400w sub, and two sets of E30 surrounds. ---  --- I'm big on trying anything before I buy it.  I was able to listen to these and the E80s (the dual 6" floorstandings) at a local audio store before they were discontinued.  I loved the sound of these and the Polk and Klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics. With the JBLs at a fraction of the price here on Amazon, it was no question.   ---  --- The only issue was what model to get... --- I heard very little difference in qualtiy between the E60s and E80s.  The dual 6" put out a bit lower frequencies, but the difference was so small that I wouldn't be able to notice without the speakers side by side.  Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful, but a bit overkill for what I needed.  I deceided on these over the E60s with the hopes that a single 8" would draw less from my amp than the dual 6" for a bit less money. ---  --- Beautiful home theater and music speaker... --- crisp highs, defined mids, and respectable bass.  They are a bit top heavy, as any tower will be.  and I love extremely low, loud bass, and as such, I suplemented the system with a sweet JBL sub. ---  --- Movies sound great: --- Saving Private Ryan, Fifth Element, 40 year old virgin, Anchorman, etc... etc... --- Music is also fantastic (with different amp settings tuned for genre): --- Ambient, electronica, hip-hop, rap, jazz, 80s, classical, rock. --- Ulrich Schnauss, Bonobo, DJ Shadow, Busta, Snoop, E40, Louis Armstrong, Michael Jackson, Bach, Korn, Metallica, Hoobastank, 311. ---  --- If you're looking for a quality tower speaker... this is it. --- Bass fanatics, look at the S120PII.  you won't regret it. --- ~shakas~ 
For the price, I shouldn't complain, but what the heck?  What ever happened to quality control?  It came double shrink wrapped.  There was a plastic handle guard that didn't fit the sword, so I had to just throw it away.  Very little pride in the product.  The wood was roughly sanded before it was painted.  Well, it's just a stick afterall.  I'm just glad I did not purchase a more expensive item from this vendor, DreamObjects.  Read their feedback responses -- sounds a lot like aggressive Ebay sellers who get their jollies replying to negative or lukewarm feedback.  Sorry -- waste of my time and a few dollars.  I gave them a 4 out of 5 feedback simply because you can't tell quality from a single digital photo
I love this product. It just tastes great especially with milk.
I love these socks. They fit great (my 15 month old daughter has thick ankles) and she can zoom around on the kitchen floor and not take a nose dive into things. :
This is a beautiful sandal but the shoe was made from really stiff and ungiving material.  The footbed was uncomfortable and not a good fit or feel to it.  The price is right but there are so many sandals with gemstones to choose from I decided to return these sandals
I was not impressed with this book.  It's worth reading only because there are so few Ruby on Rails books.  There is too much basic Ruby and not enough Rails in this book.  I much prefered the Agile Web Dev with Rails
I don't know what other people are complaining about. I just installed Vista Ultimate a few days ago and I absolutely love it. No interface lag or any other lag at all. Maybe the people complaining have weak or outdated hardware. Those people need to turn down their settings if their not going to keep their computers on the cutting edge or at least near it. I'm glad Microsoft isn't waiting for people to catch up and are on the cutting edge. I'd rather be the one catching up than the other way around. ---  --- I have a Core 2 Duo e6300 overclocked to 2.5Ghz, 2 gigs of ram, a Geforce 7600gt and a Western Digital Raptor X 150g HD and Vista Ultimate works flawlessly on my computer. It's not the best computer but it runs flawlessly, I built it myself and all the parts cost me about $850 off the net. I play World of Warcraft among some other games and I haven't seen any problems yet with any games or any of the major software I use as of yet. I've only encountered one problem and that was with my old Soundblaster Live! 5.1 sound card which has discontinued support. No big deal, it was about time to get a better one anyway.
I have eaten this amazing cereal every morning for a year and I still look forward to eating it.  It has an interesting flavor that I know I will never get tired of.  I highly recommend trying it
I would have rated this item 0 stars, if that were an option.  We discovered approximately a year after installing these that the plastic strap had become so brittle that it snapped in two with little manipulation.  Fortunately, we discovered this because we were moving, not because a piece of furniture fell.  I shudder to think what might have happened if our furniture had tipped
This new version of Illustrator is great, glad I upgraded! The Live Trace feature is cool
The Keyboard Protector fits very well on my MacBook, but in the end I got tired of how much slower my typing was when I used the protector. It claims it doesn't slow down your typing speed at all, but it really does; you have to push on the keys harder when you type and for me it took a concsious effert to do so. As I'm typing this review now, I'm not using my protector anymore. If you don't mind how it slows down your typing, then go ahead and get it.
I got this as well under the assumption that it wasnt a high end watch.  After wearing Invicta's for a while this feels like a gum wrapper on my wrist. ---  --- When I received it, I noticed the small scratches all over the crystal.  Nothing deep, but they really pick up the glare.  ---  --- Atomic signal, I am unable to get it to pick up one.  In Memphis, TN, I think I should be in range, and all my atomic clocks sync up fine.  I have tried it facing 4 different directions and also tried it outside to eliminate any interference from the house.  Still no good. ---  --- Basically I spent 30 dollars for a cheap watch that doesnt even have a backlight.  Lesson learned
Working out used to be heh for me, but after getting the door gym I made a rule. Anytime I enter my bathroom (which is where it is suspended) either before or after I have to do 10 Pull-ups and 10 Neutral pull-ups, also since I purchased the broad-reach 10 of those as well. It's working wonders, within the first week of doing pull-ups where i'd use my legs just enough to complete the pull-up I'm now able to do 10 regular pull-ups. I'm very happy with this product, only downside (which I personally don't really care about) is that depending on what kind of door frame you have you could get some denting on the front side, the backside works just fine and leaves no marks on your walls. So anyway... I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a quick and depending on how hard you want to work :P easy workout
This is fun and a good idea, but the quality of the stand and the plastic is very poor.  It fell apart the first time we had it up, and while you can put it back together, unless you want to be doing it every ten seconds, it isn't worth it.  The keyboard itself is fine. The microphone overpowers the keyboard music and has no volume on it, but the keyboard does.  The microphone stand is really cheap plastic and broke right away.  I would suggest buying a cheap keyboard and microphone and just using it on a table instead, or if you buy this product, don't expect to use the keyboard stand for long, but it can work without it
Nick Xu, if you can't figure out the difference between this lens, and the cheaper consumer grade lenses, by all means, stay with the cheaper consumer grade lenses. After all, "Mr Magoo" of cartoon fame couldn't tell a Chevy from a Rolls Royce. All kidding aside, this lens is simply awesome in use. Having one of these lenses in a camera bag is very close in practice to owning three or four high end prime lenses. Yes, it's that good.  ---  --- I am using a borrowed version right now, but as soon as I pay off my new 24-105 f/4 L IS USM lens (very, very awesome), I will buy my own  70-200 f/2.8 IS USM. It's as good as it gets in this lens range, but if you feel comfortable with a pinhole camera, carry on, as it's all about the end user. ---  --- For everyone else, this lens is the Holy Grail of mid range telephoto lenses. It is simply the best available in it's range, and responds well to Canon tele adapters. If you can figure out a way to afford this lens, buy it, as it is all that. If you are a Nikon lover buy this lens anyway, and buy a fairly cheap 20D body to make it work. It's OK to tell your friends that you used a Nikon to take the pics, but you will end up knowing that Canon is the premeir lens crafter of the 21'st century. ---  --- (Sorry, Nikon fans, but this lens stands all by it's self in the grand scheme of things. It's simply awesome.)
It is extremely easy to use.  Hard to figure out the menu, but once that is done there is no problem. Takes beautiful pictures.  Great for action shots as well.  Seldom find a blurry photo as it has a stabelizer built in
The environment of this movie was so unusual for me, since I know virtually nothing of the Maiori culture, I was enthralled with this movie
I'm a first home buyer so with the nice weather coming up i decided that i needed a grill... so I wanted something that I could smoke too so the char broil smoker seemed like the ideal grill. assembly was simple. took about 30 min. I highly recommend using sockets and also using two different types of screw drivers a bigger bit size #3 and a #1 that will make the job easier. Also, I just bought mine at walmart for $79.00. Havent used it yet but the concept seems simple enough. Probably only be able to fit 2 slabs of ribs on it. so cooking for a huge group wont be possible.
This cardigan doesnt have proper buttonholes just cut slits that are both ugly and will not last long. The texture went bobbly after one day near the arms
where are all of my magazine subscription first issues??????? ---  --- mar
The camera has really amazing features. But it also has an outrageously major focus weekness. I made a mistake of buying one
This notebook case is a perfect fit for the MacBook, and it is compact enough to fit into larger bags.  It is exactly what I was looking for
The pen is really great.  I'm a big fan of the gel pens, but they smudge really easy even after they dry for a couple seconds.  The pen also writes very nice.  Its different to work with a pen that has some square edges.  Its easy to over come. --- The pen is rather expensive, but its great that the refills are inexpensive
I just bought this through Amazon and then put it together pretty quickly.  Packaging was lousy, as others have already mentioned, and 3 pieces were either missing or broken, so I had to call for them.  First customer service rep was ok, but the next day I found the pedal crank making a sound, and called back, but the next rep claimed that I put the pedals on wrong and refused to exchange the main part containing the gears.  I held up the phone to the machine so he could hear it, and he acknowledged hearing the noise, but said I would have to open up the unit and identify the broken or loose piece on my own.  The unit came w/ that part already sealed, so I don't know how they can expect me to spend my time playing maintenance technician on their product.  Although the product appears to be engineered well, any company that's not willing to correct their mistakes deserves a negative rating
TANGLED IS ACTUALLY A REALLY GOOD MOVIE. YOU HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION OR YOU'LL GET LOST IN THE PLOT BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT WAS A GREAT MOVIE
This potty seat is the only toilet training item I have bought. I highly recomend it! My daughter thinks she is a big girl on the big potty. You need a step stool for them to get up on their own. I like that the seat is sturdy enough to withstand a 30 lb. 3 ft. 2 yro. climbing up & situating her self with out my help because ultimatly that is the goal & this product I feel helps get to that goal.
We found the system very hard to read. At night we couldn't see it at all to read it. Our family bought us the better model for Xmas, so we are going to put this one on ebay. Would not recommend it
within two weeks the hose connection was leaking.  the manufacturer never responded when i contacted the
--as I found it to be really much too fake-lemony, not unlike the stuff you smell in car dealership service bathrooms. I mixed mine w/ a subtle "cookie"-type one I coudn't smell at all & now can smell neither, even when I put them in closets, which was not the idea--I like a little fragrance thru the house. May look for something like cinnamon or sandalwood
I originally purchased the Samsung DUOCAM SCD6040.  It fortunately broke 1 week before the warranty ran out.  The video began having giant pixilated squares when video taping and on playback.  Though under warranty, it still cost me $49 (their fee) to send in the camera for a repair.  The repaired camera came back broken.  I had to deal with many customer service people, but finally got them to agree mine was a "lemon" and they sent me the SCD6550.  Now 10 months later, the video and playback on this duocam has broken.  You see a black screen with yellow blocks on the LCD and through the viewfinder.  I cannot video tape or playback anything on tape.  It is not under warranty.  I can't believe their cameras/duocams don't last longer than one year.  They must use cheap parts.  PLEASE save yourself the headache and chose another brand. 
After buying two automatic retractable Hozelock 50 foot hoses (that we love) I bought this for the extra hose length.  It is a very disappointing unit.  It tends to bounce around when you are pulling out the hose and can be a pain reeling it back up.   I am a big guy and still struggle with it.  Pull the nozzle back to the unit as instructed and then sit on it as you crank. ---  --- Regarding the comments about it only taking the original nozzle I cut off the end and put on a std US hose fitting
I have this radio for two weeks now.  I am very satisfied with the reception of AM, FM and Short Wave -- very sensitive.  Has great sound.  The only negative is the lack of being able to preset the stations.  Would buy the radio again - worth the money
VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: DOT NOT TURN ON SYSTEM BEFORE READING THIS.  --- You have to open up the parent receivers and plug in the battery pack before usage, then Charge the system for 16 hours. DO NOT TURN SYSTEM ON WHILE CHARGING FOR THIS FIRST TIME!!!  ---  --- I did a lot of research on monitors and found this one to have pretty good feedback on several parents' websites. With most items, there are pros and cons... see below:  ---  --- Pros:  --- -You will not pick-up any feedback from the neighbors. This is a significant improvement from monitors in the past. ABSOLUTLY NO INTERFERENCE!  --- -Great reception. You will have no problems picking up your child with this. I can take it outside and work in the yard, with confidence that I will know when my baby needs me.  --- -Interchangeable AC power cords make it easy to move the system around to different rooms in the house.  --- -Lightweight and compact system.  ---  --- Cons:  --- -The biggest issue is battery life. HORRIBLE BATTERY LIFE, TYPICALLY ONLY 3-4 HOURS at a time! The battery drain on this system is almost a deal breaker in my husband's opinion. This system comes with the options of 1 or 2 docking stations, I HIGHLY RECOMMED the one with two stations because the system is constantly running low on batteries and and can recharge while the parents portion is on the dock. Or the second receiver can be used while the other is charging on the dock.  --- -With any power interruption the child's unit shuts off. The parents unit beeps and flashes red to inform you of the issue, but it can be irritating at 2:00 A.M. to have to get up to turn it back on. Graco really needs to find a way to have the system stay on at all times that it is plugged in.  --- -Belt clip does not work well with normal amount of movement. The system is better left unattached to belt, unless you want to be constantly picking it up from the ground.  --- -A bit expensive. ---  --- A little of both... Pros/Cons:  ---  --- -Sound: Pro: Great sound, very clear. In fact I can often hear dogs barking outside with this monitor. Con: Picks up on every little sound because it is so sensitive. For the light sleepers, on the softest level still can be very loud.  --- -Loud, every 5 seconds, parents warning: Pro: Beeping will let you know that system is not functioning correctly so you can fix the system. This was nice for us one day when the baby's system had fallen and came unplugged. If the system had not beeped, we would not have known. Con: Annoying beeping while searching for signal... a startling fact in the middle of the night.  ---  --- *Overall the system does what it should, but there a few area's that could be improved. I gave it 3 1/2 stars but rounded it up.*
I actually bought this for my husband. He loves it, it  has a lot of great features. The only thing that we found was that you had to really wet the device in order to get it to read the heartrate.
although prince is an utter genious! this cd is merely a boring contract filler. i suggest you buy one of his older albums or the new album "musicology" instead
Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth came out of no where with this classic in "92". I was expecting the T-ROY tribute to be the only highlight, but this joint was bangin! The very underrated CL had the dope metaphors and complex lyrics. Chocolate Boy Wonder had the legendary "horns" going on. The whole album is a banger. Fav's are Pete's Sake, The Basement(Pete's cuz Heavy D rips  it), Mecca and the Soul Brother, Troy- They Reminisce, Straighten it Out( a kick in the balls for bootleggers), Ghetto's of the Mind and Skinz(CL's cuz Grand Puba steals the show on this one). Eternally Classic, rock on.
A style over substance celebration of the drag queen mentality - if you enjoy misogynist bitchy dialogue being delivered by pantomime women, this movie is for you ---  --- Elliot's love of drag queens overshadows the rest of this flimsy, contrived and lame narrative - clealry it's about getting as many shots as possble of drag queen costumes against the outback setting ---  --- It's alleged stance against homophobia and plea of acceptance of difference is trite and cringeworthy ---  --- If anything, this film reinforces negative stereotypes of gay men as nasty effeminate queens who are not to be taken serioulsy. ---  --- Sadly it's been embraced by the same pandering gay men who think drag queens are 'camp' and therefore funny, indicative of how off the mark they are of what defines camp (go read Susan Sontag boys) and how low 'gay culture' as plummeted. ---  --- There are plentiful nasty jokes targeting female gentilia, and a secondary racist commentary about Thai women 'entrapping' Aussie men ---  --- Trashy and not in a good way. A must have for no brainer gay men. --- 
If you love baths, but simply must have bubbles, then the bubble bars can be a lovely addition to a salt soak. You can also add one of these or half of a bubble bar along with one of the bath bombs. I keep buying the bath bombs and giving them away as gifts, which is an excuse to buy more lush products!  ---  --- I've tried numerous bubble bath products and these seem to produce an especially fun amount of bubbles. You can literally hide below the bubbles, there are so many. You also get the added benefit of more essential oils. With Lush products, you may have to get a journal just for bath bliss experiences. There are certain products you can blend together to create moods and moments.  ---  --- ~The Rebecca Revie
I liked the pool for this very hot summer that we have had; I would recommend a cover for it
This is a nice package of my two favorite Final Fantasy games: Final Fantasy VI and Final Fantasy V. ---  --- Final Fantasy V has never seen release here and I feel that the translation was both well done and sensitive to the original Japanese version.  Final Fantasy VI has been restored to its original glory in this version and it's a nice change to see uncensored graphics and the original "Final Fantasy VI" title with Tina(Terra) in Magitek armor. ---  --- I highly recommend this collection
I know a lot of guitarists aren't near as picky about picks as I am.  So why should you be?  After all, there is no pick that will make you play better and they are all generally the same. ---  --- WRONG.  I thought that too at first.  I figured it's just a piece of plastic, how hard can it be to pick one?  I started out with fender pick because they looked pretty conventional and they were moderately priced.  I blindly went through about ten of these due to them all breaking. ---  --- If you knew me well you'd know that I thrash my guitar...a lot...  Even the thickest picks would wear down on me within a week, and most of them were too slick to stay in my sweaty hand during these crash and burn guitar playing moments.  I came to realize that I needed a heavy duty pick with a good grip that would retain it's shape for at least a couple of weeks.   ---  --- At first I thought metal was the answer.  I mean, it's hard as rock and most of them come with a good grip on them.  But after playing with them I discovered the sound was not to my liking.  It sounded too buzzy with metal.  That's about the time I discovered tortex picks.  I was amazed.  They had the best grip I have ever felt and kept their shape for weeks!  I instantly bought every size I could get all the way from the thinnest read to the bulky blue one. ---  --- Months later I'm keeping a stock of these picks in my house.  For solos I prefer the green one because it's got just the right resistance for that fast picking but not too much so that it slows you down.  For strumming I use the orange.  It's just perfect... ---  --- I cannot express to you how much you need to try this pick.  Your wasting your money on anything other than Dunlop.  Get the tortex and see what I mean
I received one of these Bavaria Hams as a gift from a well-meaning, Glazed Ham loving, though non-cooking friend. So, being the nice person that I am, I invited he and some friends over for some Ham, Asparagus and a big pile of Yukon Gold Potato salad. And since it was hotter than blazes inside, I decided to heat the Ham and roast the asparagus and potatoes on the BBQ.  --- I slathered the Ham with my secret BBQ sauce, placed it on the cooler side of the Grill and about 2 hours later we were all sitting down on the patio with a big, hot, delicious, BBQ'd Ham staring us in the face. --- The French Rose' was poured, the Meal was consumed and a good time was had by all
Dr. Scholl's Pedicure Essentials Cracked Skin Repair Cream had a very nice smell and felt good. However, the long-term effects weren't what I expected. I couldn't tell much of a difference after using it for a week. Regular lotion that I've used in the past seemed to have the same effect. Perhaps it just needed more time to work
I enjoyed this book immensely.   ---  --- Remember, the subtitle is "MY friendship with JFK, Jr.", the book is about the author and HIS friendship with John.  It's not meant to be a historical view of JFK and his presidency. ---  --- Why is it OK for Carole Radiwill to write a book about her relationship with JFK, Jr. and Carolyn but not OK for Billy Noonan? Because he wasn't on Oprah. ---  --- Lighten up. 
We have the original "Super Mastermind" which is the exact same layout.  It's fun and enjoyable year after year but too many games at one sitting can cause a headache.  It's fun to watch others work at it too.  The pieces are small so should be kept away from little kids but age 10 and up seem to enjoy it.  It's a great addition to our game shelf and we are getting more to give as gifts
I have to write a review for the below review (the one I have in quotes). The below reviewer states this is 170 Watts and you need 1875 watts. I nearly fell off my seat! Not only by the review but by how many people recommended it! FIRST, 100 watts is average for a hair straighter. 170 watts is excellent! 1875 would melt your hair! I did not think it was fair that this person rated the item without having knowledge on wattage.  ---  --- "This straightener only has 170 watts of heating power. That is not a very good number! If you want salon-straight hair you need a ceramic straightener with 1875 watts... especially if you have thick or very frizzy hair!
Asimov's provides 11 issues annually, packed with science fiction novellas, novelettes, short stories, poems, book reviews, and editorial articles.  As with any anthology or anthology-magazine, the story quality varies, but there are some true gems.  Alan M. Steele wrote a series of stories for Asimov's, beginning with the wonderful "Stealing Alabama" and including the stunning "The Days Between".  These stories were later combined in the novel "Coyote".  One value of this magazine is to introduce readers to authors they do not know.  Several years ago, George R. R. Martin wrote a short story for Asimov's that I found enthralling.  It turned out to be a portion of Martin's then-upcoming novel, "A Game of Thrones", which is in itself the first in a series of books (now going on four, rumored to be seven overall) called "A Song of Ice and Fire" and that is probably my all-time favorite fantasy series.  Overall, Asimov's is a science fiction buffet; you get a little taste of everything, some of it good (Kage Baker's "Company" series), some of it great (Martin's and Steele's above-mentioned stories), and some of it that you take a bite and leave the rest for the bus-boy (I don't care for Elliot Fintushels' "Izzy" series)
Some musicians, like fine chefs, make it look so easy.  David Grisman is one of them.  On the CD, "I'm Beginning to See the Light," the prolific mandolinist extraordinaire is joined by Scottish guitar virtuoso  Martin Taylor and veteran Grisman Quintet members Jim Kerwin and George  Marsh (on bass and drums/percussion, respectively) for one hot little  album.  While the song list is comprised of many well-loved standards, such  as "Autumn Leaves," "Makin' Whoopee," "Lover  Man," and "Cheek to Cheek," the Taylor/Grisman Quartet seems  to have so much fun preparing its stew and adds enough incredible  seasonings to the pot to make Emeril shout, "Bam!"  As Don  Stierberg, who penned the liner notes, says:  "Music need not be  trendy to be great."  I wholeheartedly agree.  (C.A. Carlino
TaxCut is easy to use but the explanations are not complete, nor written in a way that is easy for laypersons to understand.  Many terms of art are not defined at all.   ---  --- Most disturbingly, when you first sign up for the product the price is listed at $54.95 for both state and federal filing,  but after you have already done all the work and are ready to file, the only options listed at checkout time are $29.95 for federal and another $29.95 charge for the state filing.   ---  --- This bait-and-switch is apparently widespread and common for H&R Block, unfortunately.  I called and complained to customer service and they refunded me $5.  I told them that I thought it was certainly unethical and probably illegal, and they were inviting a lawsuit with this deceptive practice.   ---  --- Finally, the program crashed several times while I was using it.   Although the data was always saved, it was quite obnoxious.  I run a high-performance, well-maintained Mac PowerBook, so I'm not accustomed to having things run so poorly.   ---  --- next year I'll go with TurboTax.
There's a review here that compares Hank III with Hank, and then suggests that Hank III adds to the legend with his clever lyrics.  I think that person has never listened to Hank's stuff.  It's hard to compete with, "You wore out a brand new trunk, packin' and unpackin' all of your junk."  That's my favorite Hank lyric, and there are many, many more--very, very clever, very hard to compete with.  That said, I love III.  He has a hard way to go, and apparently he's going it.  I can't even imagine the dichotomy he faces--looking and sounding like Hank, and I'm sure he loves that, yet wanting to do his own stuff.  I bought his first CD as soon as I knew about it, and I've been waiting for this one.  On the first one I was disappointed with his writing (but he's a kid, for pete's sake) and was knocked out by Wayne Hancock.  On the other hand--I didn't know III existed until I saw him on Conan O'Brian, and he was one of those performers who makes your head whip around and hit the "record" button so you can find out who he is.  I've listened to everything on Lovesick Broke & Driftin' and I love it.  Except for Atlantic City--once you've heard The Band do that, you don't need anything else.  Hank III, however, is on his way, and I'm rooting for him.  He's got the stuff.  (And, by the way, to echo the sentiments of others on this board, I don't listen to country anymore, at all!  It's way too pop-commercial-boring-who cares!)  I haven't listened to a country station for more than 10 years.  Go, III.       
Easy to learn, takes very good photos in well-lighted areas but you DO need to use the flash for dimmer environments - its low-light capabilities aren't that great. Very fast readiness time from the moment you switch on the camera - a bit slow to recharge from a flash, though, and there's a bit of a lag when you press the shutter button to when the photo is actually taken (not so great for fast action shots, even though it touts a "sports" mode). It's a good beginner's camera, a good pocket-style camera, but certainly not to be mistaken for a high-end unit.
I have not yet recieved this magazine, how could it be reviewed
I'd have to start off saying that Morrowind has been one of the most unique RPG's I've played.  It's been at least as immersive and engaging as Baldur's Gate 2 or Planescape: Torment.  The developers accomplished what they wanted to; to make a game where one can do as he/she pleases.  There are countless ways to play through this game!  Playing through as a thief type character is by far different than playing through as a more combat oriented character.  The world is huge, and it takes hours upon hours to explore.  There's so much that if you don't stop and turn around sometimes, you're bound to miss the enterance to an anscesteral tomb or a smugglers cave.  ---   --- Now about some technical things.  I'm running this game on a P4, 2.53 ghz, 768mb PC2700 memory, GeForce4 4200 Ti GPU.  The game runs great at 1024x768 resolution with full shadows and distance. Since the graphics are a little dated, and I more than excede the recommended system, I've chosen to install sevaral mods (which is another great way to keep this game fresh!).  Most notably, the "Better Bodies", "Better Heads" and "Morrowind Comes Alive."  The first 2 make the humanoid people look less blocky and more realistic.  The Morrowind Comes Alive adds many more NPC's (generic travelers, to ones that have something to offer; be it goods to sell or hostile bandits with nice looot) at random places, giving the game even more of an immersion factor. ---  --- Over all, I highly recommend this game.  In fact, I bought it to keep me from wanting to play World of Warcraft, and it's worked
This item came to me and as much as I tried, the only way I could view the numerals on the ceiling was to see them upside down. There was no way to turn the unit so that it would project so that I could read it from my bed. I tried placing it on both sides of the bed but that didn't work either. It seemed to me, the guts of the unit were placed in wrong. And there is only one way to move the projector. So, I cannot recommend this item.  I sent it back
The only reason Susan McCrook wouldn't talk was she was afraid she'd end up taking an ADN (Arkansas dirt nap). Case closed
I am sad it takes so long to send me my first issue-\ --- Sure it would be good if I was ever to get one? --- Dave Tuman --- New Bern , NC
The only good thing in this movie was Ms. Howard's performance, she is innocent and believable.   I can't understand how good actors like Weaver, Hurt, and Phoenix would let themselves be wasted on this. The 'plain' dialogue among the 'elders' is painfully numbing, choppy, and stilted.  And the directing drove me crazy, especially since M. Night...insists on filming group scenes as is he was just passing through, or following them without ever bothering with close-ups. These scenes make me feel like they were done by an amateur filmmaker with a his first video camera.   If you like the back of William Hurt's head, you'll get plenty of it in this film, the camera seems to avoid his face like the plague; which is too bad, since when he finally has a good speech, we are deprived of the anger I imagine was in his eyes.  I agree with others, I would have worked better as a 30 minute Twilight Zone episode.  Rent it first before you buy, and save some money for a classic thriller, like Psycho
I am only giving this product such a low rating because of the shipping.  The product costs $29.95, and shipping is $22.49 ... Doubling the cost! ---  --- This is the product we used to flavor the popcorn in the movie theater I worked in during high school.  I adore it
The book is complete brand new and I got it very quickly after the order even with the free shipping service. In addition, the price is pretty good for the book with such a good condition.
I ordered this headset in silver - Webtreo sent out white, but said that even though it appears white, it really IS silver! We argued about the color, and I finally convinced them that Samsung makes white, silver, red, and black. It took almost a month to get resolved, but I finally have the silver headset that I ordered. It is very small, light, and easy to use. There are 3 different size earpieces for a better fit. The headset gets 4 stars, Webtreo only gets 1 star.I wouldn't order any products from them again
I've never been a big soy eater until recently.  I have started trying to eat healthier, avoiding white flour, sugar, etc...Well, so I bought this product in order to have some baked foods around, like muffins & stuff. --- It is really good when used as a substitute for white flour, and our whole family is happy with the stuff I am baking!  :)   --- 
Ya, Abomination to God also set it right in his worthy review. I remember the days where this panzy was praised and all of you ate that "One Call Away" and "Right THURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR" garbage. Does 2 stars explain anything? This apparently is equal to that D4L s***, which is actually the lowest of the low. Anyways, didn't I tell you Chingy would die one year after -Jackpot- hit?  ---  --- Now that he's dead, everybodies focused on T-Pain, OH S***!  
I have used this procuct in the past with great success, but Ghost 10 is useless. Symantec tech support is (as far as I can tell, been doing computers since 1957) the worst. If you get the Boxed version It says PC Magzine September 2004 "Belongs in every serious PC user's toolbox."  Think about it using a 2004 quote. In 2004 and 2005 I would agree.  The 1st sys I installed Ghost 10 is a Dell XPX600, Boot disk will not work, BackUp will not work, blue screen when backing up. --- Tech support directed me to web sites that don't exist, and the sites that did come up didn't have the files NU tech listed.  Dell Workstations 530 and 360 both dual processor, no games, 15,000 Scsi Raid, 4GB mem, 1GB nVidia, Dual Displays -- They Crashed and had to be reformated and reinstalled. System works 2005 expired I couldn't use my Ghost 9 backups, and I kept getting virus pop ups that were generated by NU, the systems were shipped to Panama and were in Customs for over 6 mo this is not a usual event in the life of a computer, but with no tech support and my computers only starting long enough to tell me Sys Works was not up to date I reformated. I purchased (in anticipation of setting up my computers) boxed from Amazon and download from NU Ghost 10,Sys Wrks prem, NU int sec (2007 versions) but couldn't install them. That was Mid December 2006, now its January 19, 2007 and still not one answer from NU that works, yes all systems are pluged in to  TrippLite Smart3000RMU & TrippLite line condidtoners (2 Batery Backup Units), the computers lived in ST Maarten and the power was 105 to 140 volts with lots of downtime. --- Panama weather, people, public offices are great (Driver lic $24 Lic plates $30 for 3 years, St Maarten driver lic $450 for 2 years, Lic plates $400 yr) sailing is better in ST Maarten. Life in Panama ( and I don't speek Spanish yet )is good Norton is bad. l read a lot mostly tech books, I purchase tools, electronic gear, software, computer hardware, etc without Amazon it would be hard to live offshore,no need to go to Borders, Amazon is online 24 7.
Probably would buy other camera if I could do over this one takes along time to gechage after flash. It is very touchy and you get alot of blurred pictures. You have to learn how to be very steady with it
Don't expect to receive this by Christmas even though it says "in stock". I ordered this on Dec. 14th and just received word today, the 20th, that it is not expected to ship until the end of January, early February. So if you need it for a specific occasion, don't count on it getting there in time
sometimes you get a good bargain - cheap price for a good quality shoe.  this case is a classic - you get what you pay for.  cheap price for a CHEAP shoe.   ---  --- 1)this shoe is very heavy for a comfort shoe. --- 2) no arch support whatsoever. The rubber is almost too thick. --- 3) i have SERIOUS doubths that this is a leather shoe.  feels like CHEAP VINYL AT BEST.  3 days into wearing them and it looks like my shoe is going to rip in half any minute.  this paper-like vinyl/leather is pretty thin and cheap looking.   ---  --- this is by fat the worst pair of skechers i have owned ( this is my #14 pair
We needed something for our baby's room so that we wouldn't have to tip-toe around the house while she was napping. We ordered this item based on the great reviews, but didn't really know what to expect. It's much like the noise produced by a small fan, but without blowing air. It has two speeds, and complete control over the volume and pitch by adjustment of the louvers. Some reviews we read said it was not loud enough. I can't imagine that being a problem as we have it on the quietest setting (louvers completely closed, and low speed) and it's perfect. On high it's PLENTY loud for a device used while sleeping. This product did the trick for us, and I would recommend it to anybody with a light-sleeping baby
I bought this toy for my sons 3rd birthday. He likes it, but the bean bucket is really light and only takes one or two beans to tip it. He does not seem to mind because he is so young,but as he gets older I do not think this will be one of his favorites. I have a feeling this one will be sitting in the closet
Beautiful & deep blue round crystal post earrings.  I love them
I read about this product on the Hungry Girl website.  It listed Amazon as a supplier.  I read all the reviews and decided to place an order.  It took longer than I expected to arrive, since I had to pay extra shipping I thought it would be here sooner.  The extra shipping must have been  for the cool pack in the box it was shipped in. ---  --- The noodles were a little chewier than regular pasta.  But like regular pasta the didn't really have a taste of their own and took on the taste of what ever sauce you use.  I really did like them.  Being diabetic, it is a great pasta alternative that will not raise my blood sugar.  And I didn't find a unpleasant smell when I opened the bag as another reviewer wrote. Just the same I did rinse them well. ---  --- I have since found them in a local health food store so I won't have to pay the high shipping any more.  I have not been able to find the spaghetti type anywhere, only the flat noodle type and I would really like to try the spaghetti.   ---  --- I would recommend this product to any one that wants a lower carb, lower calorie pasta
I got a wagon like this when i was really small. Now I am 14 and Istill use it for getting grocries from the store.  It is still in good condition except it is rusty because i used to fill it with water nd make my friends  ride in it.   It is fun to ride down the hill from the store too my home.   It can go really fast and it's easy to steer.   You have to be careful if  you cross the road and go onto a curb with kids in it.  One time my mom was  pulling me and my sister to the store.  When she went over the curb it  tipped over and my sister scraped underneath her nose. It is a great toy  and even though i'm too old for it i still like it a lot
This cartridge is Lamy's proprietary cartridge; it isn't guaranteed to fit in other pens, and other brands of cartridges are not guaranteed to fit in Lamy pens. This is a lighter black ink, and many fountain pen enthusiasts enjoy  the variation-in-density effect of writing with lighter black inks. This ink is not very water resistant, and it is not safe for writing checks
I don't have the tin version but an earlier version.  The cards look different but the game is played the same.  I have been playing this with my now current 10 year old for 2 years and we both love it.  A little luck, some strategy, and a whole lot of fun.  Don't let the age levels fool  you-adults will enjoy this as well.  A classic that will never go out of style
July 27, 2005 --- Why haven't I heard about the Mia characters before? I bought this for my god daughters 6th birthday without knowing anything about the game. We opened it together and I was BLOWN AWAY with the 3D animation-the same quality as Pixar. Everyone at the party was glued to the computer screen in this adventure land game. Best of all, its educational but because it was so entertaininng, my god-daughter has not stopped playing it. Well worth your money! I'm going to buy the rest of the Mia series
I got this yesterday from my boyfriend and I love it. It's very pretty and I was extremely happy to unwrap it. =
I bought this camera for my wife and we find it unusable.  The problem is the flash recovery time which takes a good 5 seconds. During this time the camera's view finder goes black and you cannot use it.  Because the camera is so slow, we have missed many important pictures of our children; consequently, we found that for any important family events, this is not the camera we use.  I own Nikon 35mm SLR cameras and I am shocked that Nikon would sell this unusable product.  If it is your life your recording, I recommend that you buy a different camera
I loved the X-Men cartoon in the 90s and Fox, and always liked reading the graphic novels in Barnes and Noble and the like.  However, I just never had the time or money to get into it like I wanted.  This collection is a great way for us beginnings to understand the depth of the mythology and see the transformation of the series over the years.  Reading the first 60 issues was a trip -- seeing how the characters were developed, both the art and their literary personality.   ---  --- If you're interested in the X-Men, whether from the new movies or just from being a kid at heart -- for 40 bucks you can know it all. (almost)
After purchasing the item in december 2006 it didnt take even a week before the troubles started, it kept freezing after switching it on and took quite long to rebuild the data. At one point, (after two weeks) I lost all my data. Despite downloading the software from the website the problems didnt disappear and i am basically left with a promising player which doesnt even allow me to listen to music without frezing. ---  --- Since then i am struggling with Creative Technical SUpport team as there  --- is advise given to charge my battery or download the software from the website (which both is not been of much help) --- This player hasnt been much of use to me yet and I deeply regret having paid 360 USD.  ---  --- I gave it 2 stars because I was able to watch 2 movies while waiting at the airport and travelling, this was quite a pleasure
...if you're in the bathroom with time on your hands! I must admit that I did finish this book and was glad that the ordeal was over.  Puzo (like Leon Uris) definitely lost the touch near the end of his career and this book is no exception.  In just a few hundred pages, President Kennedy II is shown as a tyrant, a socialist, a reactionary, a humanitarian, a political bumbler, a visionary of USA utopia, a man who would kill a few thousand citizens to save himself from impeachment, a liar who can beat the ultimate lie detector, a dear and loving husband/father, etc....how many characters must one man be?  And what's this odd sub-plot of a former-Mormon/Hollywood oddball who on a whim (in less than 10 seconds of consideration when the opportunity presents itself) decides to kill the president of the United States.  Once again another character with fourteen different personalities!.  Puzo even got his basic facts wrong about the Mormons (he should have stuck with the Catholic Church). I would hate to be washed up on a deserted island and find this book washed up on the shore next to me! I would go crazy reading it again
I bought this because the only way my 6 week old will sleep is in bed with me. I bought this to try to reduce the risk of SIDS since his has been sleeping in my bed. Unfortunately, he kept moving and it was causing his legs to go off of the side of the sleeper. Once his legs went off the side, his upper body would roll which would cause his face to be almost right against the side of the sleeper. Of course this concerned me so each time I woke up, I had to move him again. Finally, after a couple of time of doing this, I just took him out of it. This is the second sleep positioner I have bought and both have been worthless!!!
Gloves are toasty...perform as expected, and are a sweet luxury after a long, cold day on the slopes; HOWEVER, the D-SIZED batteries (1 per glove) are considerably more bulky than what I expected.  Most reasonable people would anticipate having to use 3 or 4 AA batteries...but no, just one, bit fat chicken-roastin' D-sized battery.  Good product, but consider whether wearing the big ol' D's around your wrist all day will get on your nerves, or whether you'll barely notice, being bundled-up and bulkified anyway.  May also interfere with cinching up your jacket sleeves when it's really nippy out.
Whoever decided this was good for four year-olds must not be a parent of said age group. My four year-old received this as a birthday present. His adult aunt could barely figure it out. It's one of those toys that collapses the moment you play with it, taking all the fun out of the imaginative play that should be occuring. We have all the little parts and bigger pieces in a pile and he just walks around with the bigger piece wondering what to do with it, even though we have the corresponding Mystic Force Power Rangers themselves. I think this toy should be perhaps 1/4 of the price listed. Simply disappointing
I have loved reading Archie comics since I was in high school. I was thrilled to find the Archie dolls for sale. Thanks
These little dots work great and stick anywhere. The light is very bright, watch you don't blind yourself. I sometimes have a little difficulty pressing so the light stays on but usually after 1 try it's fine
We have always bought stride rite shoes for our son, however the cost can be overwhelming when you are buying a new pair every three months! I was excited to find these here at such an awesome price. They are identical to those in the store and my son loves wearing them.
I'm very happy with this device.  The suction cup holds very securly.  I would advise anyone who buys a satellite receiver to skip the adhesive mounting bracket that comes with it, it will come un-stuck eventually.  Just get one of these brackets and mount the radio right in the first place
Works Great, No problems after 4 months
I bought this because it was 50% off. I can't see how anybody can get much enjoyment from trying to look at photos on this viewer. I guess for background noise, it would be good but as a photo viewer, it's not. Small screen + low resolution = poor viewer
when i first saw the game for number 5 on top games. I new i wanted it. My littlwe bro like eww that game is horrible. I ask my grandma 2 buy it for me and it so fun. I lov it if u like games that r easy than play this on
I have used the Avent Isis pump for all three of my children and thought this product would be just as good and liked the fact that it works with the pump.  I was wrong.  Problems encountered include, it is very difficult to screw the caps on tight - they tend to leak, expensive - instructions recommend only using about 4 times and then discarding, measurements are hard to read, they do not hold a full 8 ozs, due to the shape narrow on the bottom and wide on the top they tend to tip over easily, and the adaptor for the pump is incovenient as I forgot to pack it more than once!  Save your money use bags or pump into the bottles directly if you are not freezing.
My spouse is on South Beach Diet and loves these.  I portion them out in ziplock bags( 15 nuts each) and they are grab and go.  Lots of protein, some fat and very little carbs.  Fresh and tasty.
I am an amateur indian chef.  This spice is one of my favorite spices to use when I am cooking.  It is such a versatile spice, adding an exquisite flavor to any and all dishes.  It works well with a lot of different foods.  If you are in any way interested in cooking Indian, get this spice....NOW!!!!!
Indispensable guide to what is happening in movies,television,books,and popular culture. Comprehensive,witty,well-written and,of course,entertaining
I got the impression that Rankin wrote this book in a short period of time without the assistance of a proofreader or editor. It was superficial, with such helpful hints as "People come in all sizes and shapes," and "People with a warm smile are perceived as being more friendly." I didn't need to read her book to figure those out. Her logic is also flawed. She states that, "Doctors touch patients, not vice versa because doctors are more privileged and powerful than patients." Did she consider that doctors need to touch their patients in order to examine them - not because of any power status? Using the book to promote her feminist beliefs, numerous typographical errors, and trite comments also distracted from what little substance the book had to offer
Newt Gingrich presents common sense solutions to the pressing issues of our day in a clear concise and easily understood manner.  This book should be required reading for all civics and history classes in high school and college.  If the policies Dr. Gingrich proposes could be implemented, the US would not only become the shining city on a hill, it would also become, far and away, the world's most powerful economy throughout the next fifty years with prosperity for all Americans who chose to join the ownership society he envisions
I have banged my watch against all kinds of hard surfaces and am pleased to say that this thing is built tough.  Everytime I've accidentally hit it against a counter top or wall, I worry that I might've scratched it, but everytime (knock on wood) it's come out clean.  Another good thing about this watch is that it's light.  For a big watch, it doesn't weigh me down like a stainless steel model.  I've gotten many compliments on it.  I love it
I bought this carry case for my son's L-Max.  It works well for carrying the unit and all the games he has for it.  I wouldn't advise dropping it on a hard surface of any sort.  It is not nearly padded enough to be carrying a hand held gaming unit of any sort.  My son likes to take his L-Max to school with him for mornings before school begins.  I place it in the carrying case and then place the carrying case inside of his backpack to give it some extra cushioning.   ---  --- If I had known how little padding there was in this particular carrying case I probably wouldn't have bought it.  There is a carrying case out for the Nintendo Wii that is similar in style but much more padded.  I almost purchased it but then thought that I should get something designed for the Leapster L-Max.  If I had it to do over I would have purchased the case for the Wii.  It might have been a little big but the extra padding would have made up for it. ---  --- Overall, it is not a bad purchase but for the money you should get something a little more protective.  After all, the Leapster starts at $69.99 and the price goes up accordingly for the L-Max
I bought this with my camera and I guess I didnt realize I could get 3 sony tapes at walmart for the same price. My bad. But I would recommend you get the sony ones locally versus spending $14 on one tape
I'm still waiting for Poldark to make it across the pond. Until then, I'll satisfy myself with this fine work
Treasure Island has that magical touch to it Walt Disney was famous for. Treasure Island teachers one at a young age not everone is who they seem. Lots of good guys and bad guys and Pirate Treasure leads to a wild ride! This film should be required for all youngsters! There is a special place in my heart for this film. This was Robert Newton's finest hour playing Long John Silver
Ordered a new pen and pencil set, opened the box only to see "Made in China". I dont even want them now
The warmer made such a loud beep when it completed its task that it woke our baby up. So much so that we ended up staying near it to shut it off before it went beeping! Had to also physically pull out the power cord after each use as it had no auto shut off. ---   --- [...
Okami is a fantastic game, perhaps the last great game released on the PS2.  Stylish, fun, and packed with a good bit of humor, this game kept me occupied for over a week.  Although it can certainly be played a good bit faster, most people will probably rack up 30+ hours playing this game through the first time.  The action-adventure style gameplay owes quite a bit to the Zelda series, but the celestial brush adds a nice (and original) gameplay element. ---  --- Okami is not overly difficult, I found it a bit on the easy side.  The camera can also be a bit troublesome in a few places as well, but I would be hard pressed to find many other faults with this game.  Unless you have a real dislike for cel-shaded graphics, I would heartily recommend this game for any PS2 owner
If you are trying to decide between a wood or foam yoga block, I can highly recommend the foam blocks with beveled edges because they are very comfortable.  ---  --- When you are pressing on the blocks, they are firm enough to withstand your body weight, but not overly firm so they make your hands hurt from the pressure.  ---  --- Blocks tend to encourage proper form because they allow you to slowly work into poses and provide the needed support when you can't reach the floor in a pose. The lightweight blocks are easy to move from side to side and they can work as an extension of your arm.  ---  --- There are many ways you can use these blocks and once I started to do the Yoga Step By step workouts/yoga practice sessions, I found I really did need to buy softer yoga blocks to try some of the more advanced positions.  ---  --- ~The Rebecca Review 
Very high quality/durability. This glove works well as it should. Only complaint (splitting hairs here) is that it gets pretty hot pretty fast, and your hand will sweat. If you are an extreme sweater, you may want to sacrifice the quality construction of this glove for one that is more well ventilated.
I cannot believe this book had such a high number of positive reviews. I have read some bad books in my life but this one is one of the absolute worst!I am amazed that all the references to CHILD murder and rape can be overlooked by the rest of the reviewers
Sadly, this well designed item doesn't work for me.   It comes detached from its clip while I'm exercising and plunges to the floor dragging my headphones off
I got the baby alive Hispanic doll for my daughter for Christmas. I opted for the Hispanic doll becuase I thought my daughter would learn a bit of the two languages as we speak French primarily in our home.I must have received a broken doll because our doll is nothing like the description. She does not speak English at all...you can press her bracelet a million times and no English. And when she does speak, her English is slurred and unintelligible. We have contacted Amazon several times and have had them decline a return. After 2 months, we are still wiating for her to eat and fall asleep. VERY DISAPPOINTING! Would not recommend at all!!! The reason that this rating received one star is because my daughter loves her death even though she does nothing
This game is, simply put, not good. I got bored to tears playing it, then ended up giving it away because it was robbing useful space on my desk. It is slow-paced, predictable, and not suspenseful at all. In fact, these characteristics are probably why it's so mainstream, even though it's laughable in comparison to real first-person shooters, which by the way don't even belong on consoles. Owning at this game means you are an average player. Any true FPS gamer knows what childish, pathetic garbage this is, while the rest just go with the hype. Many have successfully deceived themselves into thinking it's worth anything at all. It isn't
I bought these as gifts.  For the price, you can't beat it.  The tins each had a horrible sticker on them about shipping the items as a unit, I assume instructions for the warehouse packer.  When peeling them off, a lot of residue was left behind but it easily came off with rubbing alcohol
The story of Wim Wenders' "Wings of Desire" is told through images and thoughts.  Abandon all expectations of seeing anything resembling a conventional film before watching it.     ---  --- Two angels glide through the streets of Berlin surveying its inhabitants.  Cassiel (Otto Sander) embraces his role as witness but Damiel (Bruno Ganz) wants to break free of his ethereal existence.  He is willing to cast aside his immortality in order to experience the simple joys of everyday life.  The primary catalyst for his desire to change is his attraction to trapeze artist Marion (Solveig Dommartin).  ---  --- "Wings of Desire" does not quite work.  It stumbles not because it is too pretentious or too ponderous.  Rather, it stumbles because it is just too abstract.   Relying on imagery and monologues to tell a story makes for an interesting lesson in unconventional filmmaking, but it also leads to frustration and annoyance to anyone conditioned to more traditional narratives.  "Wings of Desire" deserves a lot of credit for its innovative approach toward its material and its beautiful dream-like visuals.  Yet, it is a film that unfortunately will not appeal much to the mainstream viewer. 
I'm enjoying the game, it was in perfect condition when I received it.  I haven't had the chance to play as much as I'd like, but I will
This is a great fit for a silk shirt. I thought it would not be a close fit being silk, but I was wrong. This item fits snug and looks great on. Both alone and layered.  I would recommend this shirt to people that like the look of a tight tank.
I bought this camera for its great price, good reviews, and overall reputation as a great camcorder for the novice shooter. I returned the camera after three weeks, however, due to abysmal low light performance among other things. ---  --- The catalyst for purchasing this camera was the impending birth of our first child. I took the camera to the hospital and filmed some of the labor/delivery and follow up. Unfortunately, when we returned home to view our footage, much of it was grainy and plagued with shadows and silhouettes. ---  --- The camera does include a light and a MagicPix option, but unless you're using a tripod, you're bound to end up with a strobe-light effect (Perfect for recreating "Thriller music videos," but not much help otherwise.) ---  --- I also found the image quality with the GS31 to be fairly lackluster and pixilated. Granted, you get what you pay for, but I was really taken aback that my 1992 camcorder shot much better footage. ---  --- That being said, the camera did a lot better in good/outdoor lighting (albeit still somewhat pixilated), and the zoom is incredible. The camera is very light and smaller than I anticipated. ---  --- In the end, I returned the camera in favor of a more significant investment (...) ---  --- I will say that Amazon did a great job with customer service throughout. Also, if you do buy this camera, make sure to buy the DV cable (firewire for Macs) through Amazon or some other online retailer. (...
I only got about 2 hours of run time per charge out of this battery so I returned it for my money back and picked up a batterygeek universal dvd battery which is now giving me 7+ hours of run time per charge. 
The third time I wore it, as I tried to zip the bottom-most compartment with one hand (other arm is carrying my 14-month-old), the plastic piece on the main strap simply broke, and pieces just flew off and now it is completely unusable. I do not recommend this product because of its poor construction
I purchased this software mainly for Web Design.  I am beginning in Web Design and found Microsoft Frontpage 200 easy to learn with a lot --- of interesting features to design a web site.  I would definitely recommend this product
This is exactly what I was looking for.  It's longer and perfect for wearing on your hips.  Feels nice and soft and belt is not stiff
this was a great movie i really enjoyed it . the story was unique and the acting was great .i thought it was the best ghost story i have seen 
This is the first book I have read from this author.  I am truly amazed at how well I enjoyed his style.  It kind of reminded me of some of the good Stuart Woods books I have read.  I plan on reading many more from Michael Connelly.  Great read, you won't be disappointed, trust me
I bought this tool after reading all of the glowing reviews. I thought this would be a good way to save money by sizing my watches, rather than paying $10 each time to have a professional do it. I was so disappointed in this tool. The link remover only pushes the pins out halfway. You are instructed to take a pair of tweazers to pull the pin out the rest of the way. As you can imagine this is not easy. My husband ended up scratching my watch as he struggled to pull the pins out. Knowing what I know now, I would definitely have invested in a different link remover
I used a bundled package in a new laptop to create a photo album. When trial time expired, I purchase the full package. I could not open the existing album with the new software. The new full package is hard to use and the so called 1000's of templates can not be found. USE SOMETHING ELSE!!! --- I even e-mailed Corel about this. Its been 4 days, I have NOT had a response. --- DO NOT BUY!!! I RATE THIS PRODUCE AS A -2 STARS
These batteries work well.  They don't last as long as normal batteries, but the ability to recharge them makes them more than worth the additional costs.  If you have kids with toys, these are a must
Nobody, and I mean NObody, could be more of an Illustrator novice & ignoramus than I.  Several months ago I was given a licensed copy of Illustrator 9 that a departing coworker had used.  Wanting a chance to design the departmental logo that otherwise would've gone to an agency, I raised my figurative hand and volunteered for duty.  Having taught myself everything from MS-DOS to TurboCAD, to Photoshop Elements, not to mention Word, Excel, and Powerpoint (don't get me started on that latter program, argh), I figured I could tackle at least the basics of Illustrator 9.  Loaded it on my laptop, took it home for a weekend....and just about lost my sanity -- and several fingernails -- trying to learn that confounding program.  I managed to produce a few logos, one of which was chosen.  But egads, what a big, stinky bear Illustrator 9 was to wrestle. ---  --- When I saw that CS2 had this Live Trace feature, I pleaded with my workplace Santa to get it for me, and WOW!  What an overall improvement!! ---  --- Illustrator will still not be as intuitive to pick up as an MS Office product, but this comes darn close.  With CS2, they've given us "hot tips" -- little clues about what some of the tools do, that pop up when you mouse over the tool.  The intuitive menus are nice too.  Also cool is that all the text & paragraph and fill & stroke features, which used to be huge boxes taking up valuable real estate on the screen, are now condensed up on a small horizontal toolbar, like in the Office products ... and when you mouse over them, the screen tips tell you how to expand them.  Aaaahh!  Finally some help for dunces like me. ---  --- Live Trace and Live Paint are unbelieveably cool.  The very first thing I did after loading CS2 was to grab a .jpg photo of a soccer ball off Google Images, and within 20 minutes, without consulting any book or online Help, I'd converted it into a simple graphic image painted into the 2 colors I wanted. ---  --- But as for a great guidebook, the reviewer who suggested Illustrator Visual Quickstart guide by Elaine Weinmann was dead-on.  I've bought several other "highly rated" books to try to help me through the quagmire of Adobe products, so I've seen them all.  The Visual Quickstart book doesn't have any of that insufferable "wanna-be-a-comic-novel-author" writing, and focuses just on the basics.  And it's very literal, with step-by-step instructions.  Still there's no substitute for the utterly excruciating process of learning Illustrator through experience.  But the Weinmann book's better than any I've seen yet. ---  --- The only reason I haven't given this product a 5 is because it still doesn't have the intuitiveness that it needs.  In that way it's still "snobby" -- aimed at pros, not folks like me who need to do occasional stuff but not for a living.  But this is a far, far, far cry better than Illustrator 9.  Absolutely worth the money, just for Live Trace and Live Paint alone
I have a volvo 960 sedan and wanted to use the seat saver in the middle seat and it DID NOT work.  The bottom section was too large for the space between the seat belt/buckle and did not allow the carseat base to be properly placed. My friend has one of those nylon seat protectors and it is much better
Outstanding service.  Product as advertised.  Excellent packing job. Arrived in record time.  Would buy again from this seller
Undoubtedly the worst 'Best Of' DVD ever made, even if someone gives this DVD as a gift you should punch that person in the face...after watching this DVD I felt like burning down the company that made this DVD . If you want to play a practical joke on someone then might as well give this DVD to him as a gift.  ---  --- There might be emotional reasons why there were some positive reviews of this horror, but it can't be for the actual DVD. There aren't words to describe how bad it looks and sounds. Shame on the band for putting this out. Obviously all them cares about is getting the money and run with a 'Best Of' on DVD.   ---  --- This item should be removed from the shelves for poor quality in picture. My taped videos on VHS from MTV and VH1 sound and look better than these ones, really. This essay in amatuerism may have some interest.  ---  --- For worse, is unforgivable is not including the whole video stuff from 90's to 2000. 'Love Is Blindness', 'Walk On', 'Elevation' and several alternative videos were edited out. Didn't they have another filmed version of 'Gone'?. Mexico City 1997 was just a below average performance. Shame on U2 for keep going with 'Gone' from that bad shaped Bono's rough night. I still dont understand why we must to keep watching the same footage for a particular song. Im talking about 'Until The End Of The World'. In case you dont know, THERES an actual video clip from that song. Rather, they just put the well known Sidney 1993 version here. ---  --- Rumors say they're going to release a DVD Boxset by late this year. I really don't want 'remastered' versions of shows we've been watching for even 22 years. Rather, I'm fond of watching previously unreleased footage.  ---  --- Just in case, here's a list of several unreleased PRO-SHOT filmed concerts from early 80's to Pop Mart Tour (I didn't include Elevation because there're 2 DVD's out there from the same Tour). Cheers  ---  --- 1- Belfast 23-01-1981 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  --- 2- Berlin 04-11-1981 (Great Goncert)  --- 3- New York 22-11-1981 (Good Concert)  --- 4- Hattem 14-05-1982 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  --- 5- Roskilde 02-07-1982 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  --- 6- Devore 03-05-1983 (Great Concert)  --- 7- St. Goarshausen 20-08-1983 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  --- 8- Dortmund 21-11-1984 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  --- 9- Montreal 27-03-1985 (Great Concert)  --- 10-Los Angeles 18-11-1987 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  --- 11-Dublin 31-12-1989 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  --- 12-Stockholm 11-06-1992 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  --- 13-Washington 16-08-1992 (Great Concert)  --- 14-Anaheim 14-11-1992 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  --- 15-Dublin 28-08-1993 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  --- 16-Adelaide 16-11-1993 (Great Concert)  --- 17-Rotterdam 18-07-1997 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  --- 18-Sao Baulo 31-01-1998 (Great Concert)  --- 19-Santiago 11-02-1998 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  ---  --- What the hell are U2 waiting for?  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  --- 
I bought this yesterday when I knew I was going to a "tailgate" party where I would be away from the baby and having a few drinks, and I may have to "pump and dump".  I was nervous at first, but this thing worked PERFECTLY! It worked just like it was plugged into an electrical outlet. It successfully pumped my breasts in 10 minutes and it fits into the case next to the regular plug. I also bought the Medela sanitary wipes to clean the breast sheids since there was no sink near by. This outlet plug is a must have if you want a quiet, clean and safe place to pump your milk. The cord is 8ft long so you can go back into the car. I love this thing and wish I bought it sooner!! It will also be great on long trips, too, so you don't get any clogged milk ducts. Highly reccommended!!
This product was such a waste. The little granules made a mess when used as a styling agent for blow-drying the hair. I will not repurchase it.
I love this clock. I wanted a small clock for my bedroom and didn't realize it projected when I bought it (was an impluse purchase when buying a DVD player) I can't live without it now. I am nearsighted so this is great in the dark. I have given four as gifts (that's what I'm buying today) and I find that when I go away it takes me a couple days to get used to the clock not being on my ceiling! I will ALWAYS have a projection clock from now on. I couldn't live without it.
Well...don't know where to start...... --- bought this one because it has Jeffrey Combs in it, Stuart Gorden is director.....and they did a good job on Re-animator. --- but let me tell you, horror freaks will be disapointed. Only one really bloody scene is worth watching...not because of the blood, not because of the gore.....just, because it is the only bloody scene in the movie...a nice looking woman is eaten by the "castel freak".....  --- If you have seen Re-animator, The Evil dead, From Beyond, Hellraiser and maybe The Thing, then skip this one..you will be disapointed like me.... ---   --- Even a John Woo action movie has more blood in it..... ---  --- 
does not cut hair as closely as their other model er 43
This is a fantastic grill. I highly recommend it if you are looking for a high quality basic grill. Assembly was rather easy and we were grilling the same evening.
John Sturges acquires a reputation as a solid director of superior Westerns filled with tense action scenes such as: "Escape From Fort Bravo," "Bad Day at Black Rock," "Backlash," "Gunfight At The O.K. Corral," "The Law and Jack Wade," "The Last Train From Gun Hill," "Sergeant Three," "The Hallelujah Trail," and one of the best of all Wyatt Earp movies, "Hour of the Gun."  ---  --- He succeeds in one of the most exhilarating opening sequences of all Western movies, when he had McQueen and Brynner riding a hearse up legendary Boot Hill creating a mood and peril that never allow the slightest degree of viewer confusion or ennui... For Sturges, the West is a man's world, and his cool, hard, detached style, emphasizing action, excitement and the rugged environment of the frontier, endorses the point... ---  --- "The Magnificent Seven" is derived from Kurosawa's superb "The Seven Samurai," a compelling tale of intimidated and impoverished medieval villagers hiring mercenary warriors to repel bandit ravages... The villagers in this case are Mexicans, plagued beyond all bearing by the activities of bandit Calavera, who always leaves them on tortillas and few beans... Three of them cross the border to offer meager pay and sustenance for any professionally skilled fighting men who will aid them... ---  --- Yul Brynner is the man, dressed in black, with the luminous dome and the hypnotic Mongolian eyes who portrays the distinctive Chris Adams leader of the seven hired gunmen hired to chase some 'flies from a little Mexican village.'  ---  --- Eli Wallach is memorable as Calvera, chief of the ruthless outlaws... He is greedy and merciless terrorizing without pity the poor peasants... ---  --- Steve McQueen gives a standout performance as the sardonic gunman ('We deal in lead, friend'), carrying appealing ease and sense of humor to his role as Vin, Brynner's first recruit and second-in-command... ---  --- Charles Bronson portrays Bernardo O'Reilly, who explains his curious name to Chris, with 'Mexican on one side, Irish on the other--and me in the middle!' Bronson, the strongest face in Western, and with a bit of Mexican in him--cunning face, steady eyes, revealing voice--the character of Bernardo O'Reilly suits him perfectly... This half-breed gunfighter becomes the conscience of the team... Because of his tender paternal instincts, he is adopted by three children who promise him, in case he falls, to bring him, every day, fresh flowers... ---  --- Robert Vaughn--who was to do nicely on TV in "The Man from Uncle" spy spoof-- plays Lee, the 'good gun' with black gloves and nightmares, living in style with no enemies alive... ---  --- Brad Dexter plays Harry Luck, Brynner's happy friend who returns to join the team convinced of the existence of a large amount of hidden gold... ---  --- James Coburn makes a big impression as Britt, the expert gunman who can out-draw a gun with his knife-throwing... His looks and vague figure of violence are quite a response for his few talks... ---  --- Horst Bucholz represents youth, eagerness, and the urge to be proved and sorted out from the boys... He was caught on the road by Rosenda Monteros... ---  --- Robert J. Wilke is Britt's insisting challenger who swells the ranks of the villains in many Westerns like "High Noon," "The Far Country," and "Man of the West."  ---  --- The Magnificent Seven's success spawned three sequels: "Return of the Seven" (again starring Yul Brynner), "Guns of the Magnificent Seven" and, last and least of all, "The Magnificent Seven Ride."  ---  --- With a terrific Oscar-Nominated Musical Score by Elmer Bernstein, "The Magnificent Seven" remains a richly enjoyable Western, shot on location in Morelos state, Mexico...  --- 
This item looks great in theory, but it just isn't worth it. The pegs are made in all different sizes - some fall out, some don't fit in, and some stick out too far, leaving you with a messy look to your lite art. One of the crayons for the neon was broken when received, but it didn't matter, since it just looked like a regular crayon drawing on black paper anyway. If you do buy this item, be sure to purchase that 25w light bulb that isn't even included
We had looked a lot of places for jack in the boxes and were pleased to find this unusual one. My girls love horses so it was a pretty easy decision to make. The music is great and it is easy to operate for both of them ( ages 20 months and 3 1/2 )
I recently purchased this pad set for my #22 Radio Flyer Wagon, but had to send them back.  If you check the Radio Flyer web site, you'll notice that the #22 Wagon sides only have two wide slats.  When I received this pad set, I noticed the picture on the package shows a wagon with three narrow slats.  The loops to attach this set of pads are intended to be affixed to the center slats.  Since my wagon only has two slats, and they are wider, the loops were in the wrong spot and weren't big enough to fit around the slats on my wagon.  I'm only guessing, but I think these might be for an older model of wagon
The roast is more smooth and mellow than Starbucks. I prefer it to Illy. Produces ample crema. It's a good value. After trying the first bag, I ordered several more. The Lavazza has become my daily espresso bean -- at least until the 8.8 pounds runs out! FWIW I grind with a Rancilio Rocky burr grinder, and my espresso machine is a Rancilio Miss Silvia
Use it with new Xerox Scanner and once the correct set up is utilized, it works wonders. Very satisfied
After years of using Symantec Norton Antivirus and related internet security products, the upgrade to 2007 seemed like a no brainier.  That was until the install started.  If you run into error 9999,171 you may as well give up, it is over.   ---  --- Following the Symantec directions for resolution of the dreaded 9999,171 error caused the entire windows XP install to be corrupt and necessitated reinstallation.  Believing that a reinstall was not all bad as it would clean up several old and no longer used software pieces and provide a clean base for installing Symantec I marched forward.  Once XP was installed and current with the patches it was time to install Symantec again.  No luck, I was still receiving the 9999,171 error. ---  --- Now it was time to get someone on the phone for support.  This is a good trick since Symantec does not readily publish a phone number for support.  The number by the way is 877-832-2810.  Be prepared for a long wait on hold.  During four support calls I experienced no less that 40 minutes on hold and the longest was over one hour.  Support is provided by offshore resources in India so not only are you fighting a technical problem you must also overcome the language barrier. ---  --- The four separate calls to support resulted in multiple steps to clean up old installs, prep for install, reboot, reinstall, hack through the registry, and oh yah corrupt windows XP again needing a second reinstall.  During the final call, the support rep finally gave up and indicated the Symantec could not be installed on this Windows XP machine. ---  --- I have since moved on to McAfee Internet Security Suite 2007.  The install took about ten minutes and I am now up and running again. --- 
I love the Medi-beads products, and highly recommend them.  Although not as comfortable as the pliable elasto-gel, I love the moist heat and the weight of the pads.  I used them therapeutically both for myself and for massage therapy clients.  I only wish they made a longer one to cover the entire back, but 2 of the king-sized pads will do it.  Microwave time will vary according to the power of your microwave. 
I've seen very inconsistant reviews for Silver Insanity items.  I received this necklace for Christmas last year, and it's pretty nice.  Generally I always receive a compliment when I wear it.  For the price, it's worth it. If you're looking for something nicer, you're simply going to have to pay more
This carrier didn't survive one airline trip.  The bag was ripped and the wheels torn off upon our 1st trip.  This carrier is junk.  Waste of my money
Over the years at various jobs, I have seen this flashlight several times. It is abused and subjected to the most terrible chemical and physical abuse. It may end up looking beat up and yucky, but they always work, no matter what the contractor or whomever does to it. If you need a reliable flashlight for the toolbox, work truck, pick-up glove compartment, etc., this is the only one you need.  ---  --- If you need a good flashlight at home, and tired of buying and throwing out all those junky flashlights from the grocery store, this one will be the last flashlight you will ever have to buy. I finally bought one just for my home, and I am only sorry I did not do this years ago (I am also happy to have one of these things that is not totally beat up like the one in my toolbox; I refuse to replace it).  ---  --- I like this version because it has a strong magnet, and you stick onto the refrigerator or the side of your truck. I also like that it has switch guards, so it will not be accidentally turned on because it is buried beneath 25# of stuff in your toolbox.  ---  --- One nit-picky complaint. It has a clip for a spare bulb behind the reflector. However, it comes empty and you have to supply your own, so buy a spare bulb at the same time you buy this flashlight. 
It's a 72mm lens hood, no vigneting, works great. A must for using EF28-135 outdoors
These are great socks.  In the description it mentions that they fit sock sizes 10-13.  I assume that is the same as shoe size, but it is not explained.  This, however, is an important point, since I wear a size 10 shoe.  I can wear the socks and I really like them but I wish they were a little smaller.  One size does not fit all.
This is a must have for your little sweetheart! My daughter carries this purse around with her everywhere that she goes. It's quit interesting finding what she has placed in her purse next ;)The accessories are cute, but she'd rather use stuff from Mommy's purse. ;) The purse is oh so cute too, and durable. My daughter is 21 months old, she received this on Christmas and has been a favorite since.
Quite different from his later big-band recordings. Some of the songs that you may find on Wes' 'BEST OF' collections sound too much like elevator music. Not so with this debut album. A drummer, a organist, and a guitar player; no horn section. Stripped down in the sence of band size but very deep and articulate playing. He shows of his trade mark octave playing, his chord solos (played over the organs rythm chords none the less), and flashy runs across the fret board when needed. A good CD to start with for the guitarist who wants to play jazz.
I feel that it is just way too much money for what you get. I own a lot of professional (Canon) equipment and gladly paid the price because they are the best things out there. But it makes little sense to market a marginal product and still expect to command a high price. ---  --- I have the S80. No complaint there. The leather case was just way too tight, which invites a fumble as you try to pull out the camera. The flap issue is an issue. The neck chain is a bit short, and similar and better items can be had for a lower price. If you shop around you can also find the Li battery for less. ---  --- I'm not upset, but just disappointed with what I got for the price
Looks nice when it was standing. Took several hours to erect doing it by myself. Had 20 mile per hour winds and the thing broke apart and I had to throw it all out. Wrote to the company because it was only 2 weeks after I received it, and heard nothing back. So, if you live in an area that has a low to no wind factor it is a good buy. But if not say goodbye
The only satisfaction I have gotten out of this product is this opportunity to vent.  If the price seems too cheap, it is.  Where to begin?  Instructions, pretty bad.  Hardware, missing, inconsistent, inadequate.  Design, deeply flawed.  Mounting, not on my standard mountain bike.  Manufacture, cheap, cheap, cheap. ---  --- What result culminated my frustrating evening retrofitting it just to see if it would work?  I'll spare you the suspense, it didn't.  Not a glimmer.
The recepients of this gift loved it!  It arrived in time for Christmas and was well packaged
They do just what they are supposed to.  Easy to put together, fill up, and store way.  I'm getting more
What could have been a hilarious, informative account of breaking outlandish old-fashioned laws and getting (or not getting) in trouble for them turns out to be no more than the story of a couple of clueless young British guys (I think the author is around 23) wryly making fun of America's perceived backwardness. Sometimes it just seemed like they were trying to do things and, when they couldn't, they outright gave up on some great chances. The Swedish girls in Frisco: WHY include it if it didn't come to fruition and, furthermore, involved no lawbreaking??? I'm still wondering why they included their 2-page tour of Hearst Castle when it was little more than a miniscule travel log (cool, Hearst had Greco-Roman statues in his poolroom). ---  --- They don't get arrested and they don't really accomplish anything. Too bad
I am a serious foodie that loves to cook and is always looking for new ways to shake up the meals that I prepare for my family.  The beauty of "Gourmet" is that they do not concentrate on the cuisine of one culture.  I also appreciate that they provide articles on both the best methods, and on quick methods and dishes.  I have read "Gourmet" off and on for at least 20 years.  The magazine has changed somewhat during that time.  The focus has shifted to more of a lifestyle magazine than a pure cooking magazine. ---  --- The features of the June 2006 edition are as follows: ---  --- Tiki Time:  a collection of Polynesian food and drink --- We are Family:  recipes for a summer party --- A Greece Less Traveled:  northwestern Greece travel and recipes ---  --- In the section, Seasonal Kitchen, there is a very well done article on salads.  The roasted vegetable panzanella is fantastic. ---  --- In the Gourmet Everyday section, I always enjoy the three regular articles:  Quick kitchen (30 minutes meals), Five Ingredients, and 10 minute mains.  These are always tasty and usually all quick. ---  --- If you are a foodie, and/or you want to be this magazine is a nice starting point.  I would suggest that you pick up a couple of issues on the newsstand to confirm that this magazine is for you before subscribing.  I highly recommend this magazine for budding home chefs.
This is a wonderful book, aimed at helping the struggling new mom with the all-too-often misunderstood Post-Partum Depression symptoms.  While I am thrilled that such a renowned star is willing to share her story for the benefit of others, I urge Brooke Shields to re-consider a comment she made recently. She indicated that while she KNOWS now that Post-Partum Depression is real and requires treatment of both medicinal and therapy support,...she does NOT believe that ADHD exists nor that it requires the same level of support.  It is essential that such public figures realize that what they HAVE experienced is not the ONLY form of reality.  Thousands suffer with ADHD in ways that interfere with their livlihood, schooling, relationships and self-esteem issues.  Studies have shown this challenge to be as REAL and as DEBILITATING as Post Partum Depression.  So please,Brooke...don't deny the realities of OTHER maladies, simply because you haven't experienced them. You of all people should realize how frustrating it is to have your challenges blown off by others. Your "voice" is heard loudly.  Your message must be correct.  Thank you
These cards are overall a good deal. They work best for invitations, announcements, and other times when you will be doing mass mailings. They are a little too flimsy for my liking for nicer, individual cards, despite Avery advertising them as "heavyweight" on the box. That's the only reason I give them four stars instead of five. Other than that these are great cards; I haven't had problems with smearing or paperjams at all. The cards are scored evenly and fold very easily. The texture is a nice touch, too
very efficiently drains about as much milk as I can get with the Pump in Style Advanced for me, and very portable and easy to clean. I use it when I have a little more time or when I don't expect to pump more than a couple ounces (between feedings). Despite Medela's warnings, I would say you could use this to pump daily, aslong as you  are careful to fully drain the breast (massage), but maybe not okay for maintaining supply for multiple pumping in a row
This magazine is great! For sport-specific magazines, this is probably one of the best that I have seen. Yes, the photos are large and detailed. But, the kicker is the writing. Incredible content without being wordy. Variety of topics and approaches brings out varying highlights of the sport. Just very impressive
Rockstar games  are rocking the gamers world,one more of the great titles from the leaders in adult games
I just want to let potential marketplace buyers of SALO that the seller: closeoutgoods and other Amazon marketplace sellers are selling pirated (bootlegged) editions of this movie and other Criterion DVDs. If Amazon were legitimate, they would ban these marketplace sellers from their website. Every potential buyer should report these crooks to the FBI and Criterion
I beat the hell out of everything I own. My PDA which this has partially replaced has an aluminum hardshell case and a metal body. I have broken just every watch I have ever owned (and I have/had a few excellent watches). I am naturally hard on things due to my focus on life not on my gear. This little notebook has kept itself together so far, while looking very hip.  ---  --- I am a software engineer/project manager and am cognisant of my technological options, this is just faster, lighter and thinner than my PDA for scribbling notes. I am never without it in the office.  ---  --- The back folio pocket and the elastic strap looked dumb when I first bought it. However, I use the folio pocket for receipts to be reimmbursed (better than leaving them in a pocket to be washed or thrown out)and the elastic strap serves double duty as a second bookmark and to keep the notebook together (keeping it closed helps it survive). ---  --- I like the construction and archival quality of the book. My notes look more like those of a disorganized madman than a manager (I am starting to wonder if they are synonomous) but if I ever have to refer back to them I can be assured that they will be there for a long time.  ---  --- It only received 4 stars because they are [...] a piece and at my current scrawling rate, I will probably need about 4 or 5 a year. Just get your company to pay for it if you can, because they are notebooks that you can rely on to be there for a long while. ---  --- Lastly: For the person who likes their Montblanc notebook with tear out pages, they are partially missing the point. These books are for archiving and keeping records (of questionable usefulness in my case) not for making quick throw away notes. I also highly doubt that their notebook is as thin as one of these is either. Each have their own place
This is great to have if you are going to be on the road and need to pump.  The long cord was helpful too, so you can sit in the backseat and be discrete. It was a bit tough to insert into the outlet in my car, but I 'm hoping that it gets easier the more I use it. 
Works like advertised. Syncs well with atomic time from Colorado (I am in California). Looks nice. --- 
I find this store to be very accomodating.  Will definitely shop there again
some of the pros of buying the sniper rifle is... --- it shoots crazy fast and is very accurate --- I shot my uncle with it and it made him BLEED --- none of the kids in my neighborhood want to fite against me any more --- some of the cons of buying the sniper rifle is... --- the safety can't be pushed to hard or it comes out --- the handle starts getting kind of wobly and mine came off --- the battery takes longer than it says to charge to work ---  --- please take my advice because I have had this gun for more than a year now and I know it front and back
We 1st found this coffee at a local store. The local store decided not to carry it anymore and we were without it until we found that Amazon sold it. --- It has a good aroma and taste plus it is organic as well.
I've been taking these for over 3 weeks.. I have not seen any new hair growth.  I think that new hair that does grow will be stronger but this has not caused my hair to grow any faster.  I would suggest just buying hair supplement vitamins from GNC or any other place you can find them.  They are much less expensive
When mini-wheats first came out in the grocery store, I tried them. However, I found they were bland. It was like trying to eat sticks in milk.  ---  --- Then came "frosted" mini-wheats. Okay, I decided to give it a go. Now I had sticks and sugar in milk. However, I did find out that if you forego the milk and just eat them straight from the box, like potato chips, they are excellent! ---  --- Now Kellogg's has added fruity flavors to the mini-wheat. THESE I CAN EAT IN MILK! Yippee! Finally!  ---  --- I picked up the "Strawberry Delight" in bite size. Even though I can eat them in milk, I find that I still prefer just to eat them straight from the box, like potato chips, a type of chex-mix, or square wheat thin snack.  ---  --- Each serving has 140 calories. Compare that to other cereals and you'll see it is about 60 - 100 calories less. No saturated fat. No trans fat. No cholesterol. No sodium. Total fat is only 0.5g according to the box. I don't see how, since zero and zero is, well, zero. But I can live with 0.5g.  ---  --- Here is the bad news, the carbohydrates. There are 35g of carbs here. But that is about the same as all the other brands. Diabetics may want to pass on this due to the 10g of sugar per serving. And remember, a single serving is about the size of HALF a base ball. Not much. So if you are just pouring cereal into a "cereal bowl" without measuring, you are probably getting 2 or 3 servings in that one bowl. ---  --- All-in-all, unless you are diabetic, this mini-wheat is terrific!  ---  --- Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews
So far I am very happy with this purchase. It seems to be relatively accurate with temperature, humidity and pressure readings, and the atomic clock sets itself every night. ---  --- I love having the sunrise/sunset times as well as the moon phase displays, And it's very easy to get that data for any city for any date without having to permenantly change the date or city on the unit. Very cool. I don't like the fact that the moon phase display is "backwards" - a full moon, in my opinion, should be a full white circle and a new moon should be a black circle. This unit shows the moon as black instead of white. But once you get used to this, it's no big deal. I really like the fact that all of the buttons are on the front of the unit. Some other La Crosse products have buttons on the back or other hard to reach places. ---  --- I have found a few problems with the design. There is a curved glass (or plastic) cover over the entire display that is very reflective. The reflections make it impossible to read across the room. In fact it's difficult to read standing right in front of it because of the reflections. It's best to stand just slightly to the right or left. ---  --- I was excited about the fact that the display shows the high and low temperature and humidity at all times for each of 3 sensors. However, I was dissapointed that you can't recall the date and time that the high and low was recorded, as you can with other La Crosse products. Also, when you reset the high/low, you have to reset all sensors at once instead of being able to reset each individually. ---  --- It can be challenging to set up 3 remote sensors, especially when you have more than 1 base unit, but it can be done (I also have a La Crosse alarm clock that projects the time and outdoor temp on the ceiling, so I wanted to get both units to read the same sensor as #1). ---  --- Although this may sound like a negative review, it's really not. The features and functionality of this unit far outweigh it's shortcomings. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants the features it provides. Make sure the dimensions fit your needs. It might be a bit large to sit on a desk - best to hang it on a wall. It also comes in oak instead of brushed aluminum sides.
When I bought this camera the sales people tried to get me to buy another battery.  They said the one that came with it would only be good for about 20 minutes.  Now I have bought alot of items in my lifetime, a 20 min battery on a camera just doesnt seem like a very good "business" choice.  So I said no.  So I got the camera, charged the battery until the light went green (which sucked because I wanted to play with it right when i got it) and started taking pictures (oh I also got a 2G CF) worked great....so I planned to go up a mountain and take soem scenery shots.  Keeping in mind what the sales person had told me I pocketed the charger just incase.  Well, 6000', 300 pictures, and 5 hours later the camera is still running strong, still have 200 shots left for the trip home, battery life indicator hasnt budged off of the full button.  So all in all, I think the battery life is great, now i can see if your taking say thousands of pictures all in a row you may need another but for just going on a trip and shooting a few pictures at every stop point, the original will work fine.  as for the quality of photos.....i love them
I used this product and can't say enough good things about it. My friend bought it for me for my birthday and it was fun and easy to use and I lost 30 pounds in 6 months and I was never hungry. I ate at restaurants and always managed to find a perfect menu in my DietMate. I love it.  thank yo
The best edition so far,however... --- The color is smeared and skewed just enough to bother me. But what do you want for 10 bucks? I saw Gorgo a bunch of times in first run, and I remember seeing the actual Gorgo creature on it's trailer being driven up Woodward ave in Detroit on it's way to the Fox theater. A great promo. The eyes are the thing I remember most as Gorgo rises from the sea, those red glowing eyes were just beautiful and so expressive. The color smearing just manages to obscure those eyes. But still this print is the best I've seen. If I live long enough, I hope they issue a perfect HD version of this movie. I would pay 3 times the price of this edition to get my clutches on that. But this is worth the cost. A must for any serious collector
I live in an apartment building and play ( well, practice is a better word ) the bass guitar and needed headphones so I wouldn't bother neighbors or my wife whom sleeps and watchs TV about 6 feet from where I sit and play. ---  --- The 10 foot long cord was perfect for distance for sitting or standing and moving around while playing, so I wouldn't have to use an extention cable ( and usualy end up with feedback/distortion associated to an unshielded connector in an extention cable) ---  --- The volume control on each earpiece lets me adjust the volume so I don't have to mess with my amp or guitar volume settings I like to use when not using headphones.  Makes it real nice too when using an instructional CD or DVD i can turn the bass sound off in one ear to hear the instructions clearly witout needing to seriously skew the headphones off my head. ---  --- Very light weight.  Some headphones can weight the head down making you feel like one of them 'bobble heads'.  Fits firmly on the head without any pinching or binding anywere.   ---  --- Cord enters headphones on the left ear side, so you don't have to deal with the classic 'Y' split cord.  Easy to flip to the side or drape over the back out of the way. ---  --- Earpices fit nicly over my ears (no pinching, gouging or squishing with plenty of clearance around the ear) and does a very nice job blocking out noise ( when my wife is awake she watchs the TV, rather loudly, which is right next to me and I bairly notice it). Plenty of padding around the ear pieces.   Many headphones inside near the ear has hard plastic between the ear and speaker which usualy digs into the ear, but these headphones I honestly don't feel anything against my ears.  Even after several hours of use each night. ---  --- Sound quality.  Bose or pioneer they are not, but then if you wanted such high quality you wouldn't be shopping in the $20 and under headphones :) --- That being said they are very good for sound.  Sounded very good on a portable CD player. ---  --- Only drawbacks I can see is that a person with large/tall ears won't get thier ears covered by the earpads.  The inside opening of the earpads is aprox 2 1/4 inchs tall by 1 3/4.  IMO they could have been made bigger. --- Also, if you have a tall head ( good distance from top of head to ear ) you may find fully extended the headphones might not reach your ears. ---  --- I have a head like Drew Carry ( give you an idea head size/shape I'm talking about) and if the extension to each earpiece would have been any shorter they wouldn't have fit. ---  --- I wear glasses as well by the way and the headphones don't interfere, bind, pinch or anything like that with my glasses. ---  --- So, I highly recomend them if low cost headphones is what you are after( I don't recomend things often :) ) ---   ---  ---     ---  --- 
I've had this phone for a week. I'm using it with T-Mobile, so your mileage may vary. In my opinion, it's a feature-packed phone at a reasonable price (for an unlocked smart phone, at least).  ---  --- The Symbian 9 OS runs pretty well, although I did experience some lags and software freezes (with third-party apps). Fixing it was a matter of rebooting. I think the menu organization could be smarter, but you can customize much of it.  ---  --- I do love that the default screen displays your day's calendar agenda. But that screen hides the main menu. Not a huge drawback, but it confused me at first. ---  --- Photos with the 3-megapixel camera are grainy (it also has a VGA camera). Since this is a phone first, and not a camera, there is also no stabilization control. It does, however, come with a flash.   ---  --- Sound quality of phone calls is okay. Your friends, family and colleagues will hear you clearly. On your end, however, it will sound like you're talking on a cell phone. It's not bad, but I've had conversations on better sounding phones.   ---  --- I disagree slightly with another commenter about wireless internet (WLAN) access. It's possible to set a default access point. The problem is that if you aren't at that location regularly, you will have to search for a new network. One way around it is to pony up the cash for a data plan through your wireless provider. I agree, however that some kind of one-button auto-detect would be ideal.  ---  --- I don't like the SIM card slot. The metal cover pops off fairly easily -- as I found out while trying to insert my SIM card without reading the manual first.  ---  --- The phone's slider form factor moves smoothly, perhaps too much so. By default, sliding the phone completely open -- something that's hard, but not impossible to do accidentally -- unlocks the keypad.   ---  --- The N-80 is also bit awkward. It feels thick for lack of a better word. Its 5-way controller button also looks and feels a bit cheaper than you'd probably expect.  ---  --- Another drawback: no QWERTY keyboard. You can connect to a wireless one via Bluetooth. But that assumes you want to carry a keyboard. The upshot is that the predictive text feature is solid and sensible. When enabled, it works contextually: on automatically for SMS and email messages and off when typing URLs. ---  --- Overall, I give this phone high marks for features, but a few annoyances mean it's far from The Perfect Phone
An elf appearing to Harry Potter warned him not to return for a second year to the school of sorcery. The Chamber of Secrets, he said, had been opened and a  monster is lurking. Harry goes anyway and is the only one who can hear the monster, challenge it and save students who have been "petrified" by the monster. Age group interest: early teen. I wanted to see what all the rave was about. Lots of action, not much morale. ---  --- Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope, South State Street Journal
I might have been expecting too much, but I was disappointed with this book. I did not learn anything on Dark Magick per se. The first half of the book is about a variety of subjects like, Goths, Vampires, Lost Souls, the Collective Unconscious, Dark Deities, Satanism and some other stuff. The second half is about Magick, but it sounds more like High Magick to me. Where's the Dark Magick
On the surface, it's just another plain notebook. Not much to look at, really. But there is something magical about the Moleskine. I can honestly say that this pocketsize notebook has increased my creativity, simply by being there to hold whatever I choose to put on its blank pages. ---  --- It has a perfect size for those of us, who don't necessarily leave the house with any kind of bag. It fits in your pocket. Then there's the sturdy design: It's made for being lugged around. And though it may be plain, it still comes with a handy built in bookmark and a practical pocket inside the cover, where you can store businesscards, ticket stubs or whatever else you feel like putting in there. ---  --- I'm hooked on Moleskines. After having had various notebooks all my life, this is the only one I will use now
If you want a quality product, this ain't it.  The dreaded "Remove the Cassette" error is true and in full force.  Don't take my word for it, search the net and find the hundreds, upon thousands of unhappy consumers who purchased this piece of junk and discovered it the hard way.  I highly suggest the Panasonic AG-DVX100.  It costs a bit more, but well worth it. ---  --- Before reading other reviews, make sure that they are comparing the GL-2 to another cam, like Tony L. Shores.  He compares the Canon GL-Piece-of-junk-2 to the Sony HDR-FX1.  Sure, the Sony is much better, but it is also a High-Definition cam.  If you want HD, check out the Panasonic AG-HVX200. ---  --- Do your research, read the reviews
This book provides some brief but good background to set the context then proceeds to succinctly communicate those aspects of UML one really needs to know
Wow, I have never seen anything like this.  It's worse than bad; it is virtually unplayable from a technical perspective.  At the very least, Amazon should refuse to carry it
I loved the idea of the Clapper. I live alone so the clapping sound wouldn't bother me and I looked forward to the convenience factor. My first Clapper lasted about 4 months and then mysteriously stopped working, but the dead unit did smell suspiciously funny - like an electrical short. --- Did I learn my lesson? Oh, no! I went ahead and purchased another Clapper some months later. The night before last, the lamp I connected this one to started blinking. I checked the lightbulb and it was OK. It was only went I got down close to the Clapper plugged into the outlet that I heard the dreaded sizzling sound and saw a flash of electricity. Once again the Clapper crapped out, this time in a different lamp, different outlet. Will I never learn? --- Thank goodness nothing happened due to the highjinks of this faulty device. Can you say "housefire"? Again, how dumb am I? Is the unit UL-approved and, if so, have any other complaints been lodged about it? How does one find this out? --- I like my gadgets, but "buyer beware" on this one
...these are comfortable. You can actually forget you're wearing them. And if you are like me and worn just about every thong there is, that is huge. I was thinking I should just stop wearing thongs at all until I found these. I've washed my pair a couple times in the regular cycle and dried them, and it still is holding up well. I'm back on Amazon.com to buy more. Go for it girls, you won't regret it! Sexy and comfy. Could you ask for more... ---  --- I now own three pairs
The display fogged up within a week. I got a replacement, and it's doing the same thing.  Would NOT recommend this product.
I think that the new style of the people are not as nice and durable as the old ones
I know that this product works for some, but for me it did not. That is why I decided to return it. Wahl makes great products, but this product was not for me. My skin was too sensitive and the machine irritated it.
Excellent product don't hesitate this big umbrella is the perfect one to protect you and your equipment when rains start
VE2 has a ton of potential, but it just doesn't work out.  Brandy Davis is both cute and sexy, of course, but Playboy's Testing the Limits is a much better showcase for her, um, talents.  Not to be mean, but most of the film's other women just aren't that attractive, and many of the sex scenes are actually irritating because of the obnoxious soundtrack.  Contrary to a previous reviewer, the massage scene is fairly ordinary.  The girl-girl stripper scene is the most disappointing, however.  It starts really well, with the straight girl gradually overcoming her shyness and enjoying the stripper, but even the unrated version then fades to black without any real action.  The only scene worth watching at all is blue-collar vignette, with two girls and one guy hooking up. Stay away from this one
tuscan milk kosher! --- vitamin D and grade A! --- good source calcium! ---  ---  --- thank you
I bought the Zire 72s as an upgrade to my previous black and white Palm that I had no problems with. It has been nothing but a lemon since I got it. Often when I turn it on it has lines going across the screen and has to be turned off and then on again to get rid of them. The graffiti is terrible and rarely works. I have to reset it all the time. Customer support is terrible and did nothing to rectify the problems. I even sent it to them at one point and they sent it back in exactly the same condition I sent it to them. I don't think they even looked at it. After my experience with this Palm, I will never buy Palm again
I ordered two of these. For the first one, neither the firewire nor the USB worked on my iMac G5 (MacOS 10.3.9). A copy would start, and then hang after a while. I returned it and the second one worked using USB, but the firewire would hang like the first one. ---  --- A friend has one that works fine with his iBook G4 under 10.3.
Blatant sentimentality without any touch of irony or wit = Elefant's lyrics.  I personally like Interpol and the Strokes; I resent that they are being compared to these cheeseballs
We bought this for our daughter's first birthday. She was immediately interested and so was her three-year-old brother. In addition, her five cousins (ages 5-16) and their father (36)were also captivated. There are eleven gears in five colors that spin when the button is pushed. Initially, she loved to take the gears off and teeth on them. She is fourteen months now and puts them back on. She presses the button to watch them spin. She has taken it to the sitter's and the kids there have played with it all day. When we take it to the sitter's, I put it in a bag because the gears do not stay on when the toy is vertical. So far,it appears to be a toy that will grow with her as she and her brother play with it differently. We rotate toys, but I leave this one out continuously and I often find her playing with it quietly by herself. I have given it five stars because it offers a variety of ways to play (the gears can even be stacked), is different from all other toys they have, appeals to a wide range of ages, grows with the child, does not use up batteries (we are still on the first set), and seems very durable. I recommend this toy
Seems like a good idea for a seat.  I liked the handles for them to hold on to (more sanitary) and it sits okay on a big adult seat.  But the opening is just too small.  It is not the lack of a deflector.  I have another brand with a bigger opening for our other bathroom and my son does fine on that one.  This one the pee gets all over his legs, the seat, the stool and the floor each and every time.  This is a big hassle, unsanitary and a pain to clean up each time he tries to go potty.  Maybe it would be okay for a petite girl but not for a boy.  We are shopping for a replacement now.  I don't want a deflector type because the doctors warn that they can scrape a little boys private area and cause them to not want to sit on the potty because it might hurt.  We just teach him to point "it" down and on a potty with a bigger opening that works just fine
Planner is nice, but I was charged $6.25 for shipping!  Rip Off!!
I purchased the Twist & Shout Multiplication for my grandaughter who is 8 years old.  She has not put it down since she received it.  However mine was malfunctioned and would not give multiple choices.  It would only ask the question and then gave the answer. She was hesitant to give it up when I explained I needed to exchange it for another.  This is the only toy she has that has held her interest for long periods of time.  She nows brags to friends that she knows her multiplication tables
This firepit is the perfect size for a small patio. Its sturdy construction will hold up to many summers gathered around the fire. The glow is enhanced by the moon and stars cut-outs, making for a special evening event
well, first of all I ordered this product on Amazon and they sent me something completely different, they sent me roller skates with the wheels side by side instead of the roller blades I ask for like in the picture. Then when I sent an e-mail trying to exchange the product, no one returns my calls or e-mails me back, after so long of trying it's already past the 30 day exchange policy. So yeah, if you want a better review, contact me so I can exchange the product
A good product but like a lot of Microsoft releases, not everyone outside of Microsoft is ready for it.  Check with your web hosting service first to be sure they support sites developed with Expression Web.  That is a problem I have run into.  In fact some hosting services that support Front Page, haven't even come to full support of Front Page 2003 let alone Expression Web. You could end up changing hosting services to take full advantage of this product and its features
This is a nice book but it does not contain Provencal style interiors!  I am not sure how the author came up with that title since anyone who is interested in French country will not find it here.  If you are truly looking for Provencal decorating ideas-this is not the book for you.  CONFUSED!!
PLEASE, PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!  I have had this phone for 6 months, and I am SO disappointed!  Of course it worked for the first 30 days (within the grace period), but then I began having problems with keeping the battery charged.  I took it to the local Sprint store, and they gave me a new battery.  That worked for a few weeks, but just recently I've started having the same problem.  I just spent over 2 hours on the phone (of course not MY phone--I had to use my work time) with Sprint and Sanyo.  Of course, neither company was willing to stand behind the product, so now I have to send the phone (at my expense, of course) to Sanyo to have it repaired, which will take two weeks, at least.  So please, do yourselves a favor, and pick out a different phone
I recently bought this thinking I could use it to upgrade my TI-86 calculator. To my surprise I heard it was incompatible with XP. I supposed the worst that could happen is that it wouldn't work. As soon as I recieved the Cable it said to go to the website...  so I went and updated the software specific to my calculator. After the installation it asked me to restart. After the restart I immediatly recieved a Blue Screen of death and luckily windows XP found out it corrupted a file in the registry and fixed it but were it not for that I would have to do a format. I have not fully installed it yet as now I have started backing up everything as a just in case scenerio however i warn users that when buying this product be cautious as this is not 100% XP compatible and may mess up your system
Star Wars Battlefront allows you to play as some of the best troops ever, such as the Rebel Alliance, Imperials, Republic, and CIS (Confederacy of Independent Systems). The 3-D graphics make it easier to enjoy; as well for sound and storyline. In Battlefront, you can not play as featured characters in the saga, but you get to fight alongside them in epic duels. Another disadvantage is you can't wield a lightsaber either. In  Instant Action, you get to pick any location, and any side to fight for. You also have the choice to choose clone wars and galactic civil war. ---  --- As a matter of fact, you can drive vehicles, but no space combat! If you want to play on Episode III battlefields, your hopes are up. Only locations from episodes I, II, IV, V, and VI. There are numbers of areas to battle on. But for pros and cons, cons are going to have a hard time through the game such as: What type of soldier? Where is my command post? Where is my enemy at? For pros there is nothing wrong. ---  --- Star Wars battlefront is one of the best star wars games there is about Star Wars, along with the perfect gameplay, terrific graphics, and great sound. I highly recommend the game to any star wars buff's out there
I have used the Zonlabs Firewall for several years. It works fine. I can not say the same for the Security Suite. The AntiSpam function does not update definitions and ZoneLabs Tech Support know they have a problem. They are working on it but no date for a fix. --- Do not buy this software until all the bugs are fixed.
Book contains many useful lists / charts / comparisons to define giftedness.  Many helpful hints about raising a gifted child.  Main criticism is that the book is more about raising children in general -- and  may push those with "normal" kids into thinking they have gifted  ones and down that track -- when they should not. Gifted kids are the  exception, not the norm as this book makes it seem
 I love the this set ,expecially the nail cutter, I,m still using mine after six years
I don't care if it stops working tomorrow... my daughter has gotten so much enjoyment out of this in just one day that it was totally worth the money.   (you can get them cheaper at Target though)  She was always stealing the portable phones around the house or walking off with my cell phone... and now she has "her" phone she is just delighted.... she loves when it rings and she opens it up and pretends to talk.... so far this phone works great, but like I said... it is such a cool toy I'd go out and buy a new one right away.
Machine is well constructed but should have been made adjustable - also, no instructiuons were included and after having contacted the company to request instructions, I have never heard from the
Bought this 3-pack about 2 months ago (three computers at home) and worked ok- no viruses. Then I did what I thought was a clean install of XP Pro from XP Home on one of the computers, and it carried over a lot of garbage from XP Home I wanted to get rid of, but that's another issue (clean install?}. After installing XP Pro, I was warned I didn't have virus protection and so I tried installing my NAV again. You would think at some point NAV would have enough brains to try and establish that this was a Windows upgrade, and that the NAV was legitimate. Nope- fatal error and computer lock-up, which I was able to survive. No contact opportunity at the Symantec web site. ---  --- I simply opted for Microsoft's recommended anti-virus software- Computer Associates. Another twenty. Then I had a heck of a time uninstalling NAV, which wouldn't install and now wouldn't uninstall. What a waste of time and money. Who creates these viruses? We certainly know who benefits from them. ---  --- There is really nothing you can do- they are immune unless they hurt someone with media clout. This little note means diddily, but thanks to Amazon anyhow for the opportunity to say something.  --- 
 There's always the argument that if Bach had had a modern piano, he would have composed for it. Let's consider another possibility: if some style-insensitive time machine had delivered a piano to Bach's doorstep, he might have tried it out and rejected it as a bad idea, since it so obviously fails to serve the paramount musical ideals that inspired the High Baroque composers. --- For listeners who understand what Bach meant by equal temperament, it's worth noting that the standard temperament of the modern piano bears no close connection to what Bach was trying to demonstrate in these "pedagogical" compositions. In other words, the point is lost.
I'm an artist, and I use many kinds of inking pens to stylize my comic work. At a family member's house, I found a few of these and decided to test them out.  ---  --- As my title said, simply writing didn't do justice for this pen. The rolling ball guarantees no stickiness, the ink being luciously gel-like and practically being one with the paper, it is so smooth and slick.  ---  --- Even better is that I have never had this kind of pen leak or run, emphasizing what a high-quality tool it is. And a personal thing I find attractive is that the ink is pitch black, no faint hues whatsoever. That's just me, of course. ---  --- For artists out there, this is a good idea for drawing (reasons above and) because it has a wonderfully rounded tip, so you never need to worry about the point bending or breaking. And you still get a fine line!  ---  --- Whether you are a writer, artist, or both, this is the pen I would suggest for anyone. It's a dream in a writing utensil, simply put
This film i have to say is beautiful looking, from the characters to the landscape. Although lacking in numerous and long fight scenes, it does keep things interesting with matrix like effects. The only problem is the love between the two main characters . The movie never lets you feel the love between them , and the girl seems always distant about the love anyway  i mean it is called heart under blade right?  The main ninja character has the coolest power and he always seems troubled to use them it. This film is more of a drama sprinkled with ninja action and beautiful visuals! 
I received this very quickly. I couldn't believe I could get the actual namebrand at such a great price. Very pleased
I really did some research on digital cameras, even tried out a Sony, but the Canon brand is by far one of the best.  I don't have to do a lot of thinking when snapping a picture with this camera, it does most of the work!  I like to be able to think about the compostion of my photo and not ISO, aperature, and all that jazz.  The settings make it so easy and the color of the photos turn out so true.  The digital zoom is great and will even alert you if the picture will come out blurry.  There are so many features on this camera, too many to list.  I even found a great deal at Best Buy on a 2 gig memory card, I get  over 1,000 photos with a high resolution!  It takes alkaline batteries, but I bought rechargeable ones and one charge lasts a long time.  I am sooo happy with this camera, I take it with me everywhere, even a couple of days to work. 
Bought mine at WalMart (USA).  Came in a box that looked like it had not been opened. However when I arrived at the destination where the starter was necessary, (Mexico), the box was short the pieces necessary to charge the starter as well as the extra inflation devices.  WalMart was great and mailed me the missing parts.  48 hours later, after the initial charge, I was back in business.  Both clamps are metal and well built. --- Yea, WalMart and Yea, B&D
There is absolutley nothing wrong with the car charger.  It works fine.  However the fm transmitter has 2 problems for me.  1 -- The connector is not long enough to connect through many of the protective cases made for Zune so you have to take it out of the case.  2 -- The signal is VERY WEAK and did not work for me in either of my cars.  I ended up buyin a cassette adapter which worked much better and there was a 100% better sound quality
Well, I ordered this online as we couldn't find any window-mounted feeders locally. It's lasted exactly two weeks. The problem is the extremely weak design: the 14oz glass feeder is fairly heavy-too heavy to stay attached to any glass with two measly suction cups, as this has. There are somewhat strange instructions with this model, directing the user to "rub" the suction cups for several minutes in order to (supposedly) build up a proper "suction"-then the glass slides into a groove; well, the thing worked at first-until I had to slide out the glass bottle portion to refill it. I did it as gingerly as I could, not disturbing my preciously attached suction cups, refilled it(only halfway!)-and replaced it. About 4 minutes went by-and then the entire thing-glass, suction cups, everything-fell to our deck, breaking into a million thick glass shards...frustrating me, the hummers-and our two dogs, banished from the outside until I could clean up this mess. What a crummy product! And overpriced-although I wouldn't buy it again for two cents. Beware
Musician's Friend is a great outfit anyway, they've never steered me wrong. This product came fast as lightning, and as I read in the other review, the sticks were inconsistant, but I can't complain. We received a pack of 16 sticks, more than advertised. They are obviously not professional quality, but great for practice. My son goes through drumsticks like mad, and these are lasting just as long as much more expensive sticks, bought at our local Music store.
I love this chimp and I am an adult.  All the kids in the neighborhood come to play with it.  It is so realistic
This book has a lot of information about how protecting wild areas works in WA and and an overview of the protections offered by the United States Government. It then provides the inspiration to get people started through true stories of grassroots projects. While the book doesn't list 1, 2, 3, what needs to be done to start a grassroots movement, that shouldn't be expected, because all people have different motivations, and this book should be used as a tool to help you understand the basics of how these sorts of movements work. A must for anyone who wants to further understand Washington state for all of its great wild places, or anyone for that matter, that is looking for inspiration on why wild areas should be protected. Plus all of the proceeds go to a great cause
Our growing row of Everyday Food issues has the potential to become an extremely resourceful cooking library, but where is the card catelogue? If I want to find a particular recipe or a new recipe that I can make with a particular ingredient, I'd have to flip through hundreds of pages. ---  --- Luckily, I located a downloadable Everyday Food Index at OmniNerd.com. When used together, the magazine and Index truly make something that can be used effectively everyday
Umm. This is ink. Not much to say other than it works fine with my Epson R320 Printer
I bought this cable half minded reading the other reviews and i was bit worried whether it will work. When i hooked up the cable between my laptop and TV, wow.... this is really worth a buy.
I like this sheet so much better than the thin ones.  It offers more padding and seems so much more comfy!  It is a tight fit, but I had no problem fitting the sheet onto my Eddie Bauer pack n play.  So, I would assume it should fit any pack n play.  Just make sure to wash in cold water, and hang dry.  I never put this in the dryer.  The only thing I don't like is the color.  It happens to match my navy blue playard, but I wish it came in some lighter colors
I did not get the Instructional DVD, so I was left with a clipper set I didn't know how to use..
Wow, I love this mic stand!!! It really works well, especially since I play guitar and you can adjust the boom. It's great for kids, and grown-ups, too. I recommend it to any kid that is just starting to sing, or if you want to record onto cd's, you can play guitar and sing. Rock out!!!!!!!
Okay, here is the deal.  This thing is built well, but it's dimensions and performance work against it.  It's height and width are just right for a pocket book, but it's thickness gets it in trouble.  It's a clunker, if you put this thing in your pocket (if it will fit) you will feel it.  Hell, it might even pull your pants down.  The thickness also makes it awkward to write in since it never folds flat and there is always resistance when jotting down an idea, which makes writing a chore (which is counter productive to the pocketbook ideal, which is maximum convenience).  If you are looking for a real nice small notebook, opt for a Moleskine.  Pass on this clunker
In answer to a music fan from Temple Hills, the song was called King Holiday by the King Dream Chorus & Holiday Crew. It came out on Mercury in 1986 and featured the singers and rappers you mentioned. It made no.30 on the R&B Charts but didn't crossover pop. The lyrics are on the net (try Google) but I don't know if the song still is
Completely worthless! If you liked the film, go buy the DVD because this album has no redeeming qualities.  The sound quality is fair at best, even for a live album.  Almost every track is jammed with totally worthless `commentary' at the beginning or end of the song.  The `commentary' consists of recordings of about a dozen people having random conversations over the phone and laughing for no reason.  It would have been nice if they had put these `commentaries' on different tracks because the way they have it on this CD you have to wait through about a minute and a half of this crap to get to the song you want to hear.  The worst part about the album is the lack of The Fugees, which means no `Killing Me Softly'.  Sadly, you can tell that most of the artists on this album haven't played a show or practiced in a long time as they are a bit rusty and sound horrible, even for a live recording.  Some of them sounded almost as bad as Fallout Boy on SNL
Eternity was signature scent of the late 80's early 90's and has been around long enough to gain a rightful, classic status now. --- It is one of the best on the market, it smells classy, clean, zingy and has more than a touch of the erotic about it. --- Always worth having a bottle handy even if you don't wear it everyday, it is a yummy, scrummy scent
My sister loved her necklace. She was very pleased with it, and so am I
This movie gave me constipation that the Gods have never seen!  Not to  mention uncontrolable vomiting. When I was a young Russian Jewish boy ,  before I moved to my navite Japan, I had a pet lizard named Ruby. I loved  to pet his long hairy back while I fed him seaweed and chives. He always  loved cilantro (on the side).  Have I ever told you about my uncle Clair?  He was 5'6" and 423 Lbs. and wore a 48 DDD bro(TM). Oops! I droped my  match! I have to go. My parrot is on fire
I got this camera for my 17th birthday last summer, and it's great. As much as I'd love to have a Canon Powershot, it's a bit out of my price range. All the people who think that using the LCD screen runs out the batteries after "2-4 pictures" are lying to you. I bought rechargable batteries from radioshack, and I've taken up to 400 picture without the batteries needing to be changed. This is a good camera with good quality in good lighting. In dark or overcast situations, it can look a bit grainy, but that's easily photoshopped. I recommend that when uploading, plug it into the wall with a digital camera adapter, because uploading sucks all battery power right out. I recommend this for someone who hasn't owned a digital camera before, or for someone that wants good quality at a not-so-crazy price
While I only own one game for the DS, what makes it so great is the wifi ability to play with friends. I have spent a couple afternoons at a friend's house with several other people, all playing Mario Kart against each other, and it was a fun time full of excitement with people yelling, for either being knocked back from 1st to dead last, or managing to squeeze out the win at the last second. ---  --- The touch screen is also a great addition to the DS. Some games allow either the touch screen or the standard controls to be used, depending on preference. Others, like Mario Kart, stick to the standard controls, and others require the use of just the touch screen, creating a very unique kind of game. ---  --- The Lite is also an improvement of the first DS. While it may not be worth it to upgrade if you already have the first DS, it is worth it if it will be your only DS. The Lite is better shaped, has a better battery life, and better, brighter screens. The DS Lite certainly is a great handheld console
I bought this product because I had tried with great success another Punch product. It was so easy to use and load onto my computer. It was a great value to be able to have one product that allows me to redesign anything from interior floors and walls, to my deck and plants outside
The box is soft, and very durable. But it is a bit big.
Well, they looked so cool on TV that I ordered 2 of them and I regret it. It's awkward to get the hook back into the "rocket" once the bait is on. I took my son fishing with them and what we ended up doing is not launching them out of the gun/rod. We left the pod open with the bait on the hook and dropped it into the water and let it drift with the current. I've come to find that buying cheesey little rods and reels are simply a waste of money. If you're going to take a little one out fishing, just use your own and let them reel yours in until their big enough to handle a decent set up. The only reason I gave this 2 stars is because it was a neat IDEA. [...]
I am 67 years old and started out in photography as a kid with a contact printer and a box camera. I have had all types of cameras over the years, mostly 35mm film Canon slr's. I too bought all sorts of these 5-7 MP point and shoot digital cameras before returning to my true love, SLR's. I have had my digital Canon Rebel XT about a month now and I can't keep my hands off of it. It lacks nothing. Although the kit lense is good, I bought a 28-135 Canon zoom lense with image stabilizion and have produced stunning photo's with it. I love the way you can use the 7 points to focus, I mainly use only the center point with focus lock and never get an out of focus picture. I guess the nicest thing for me is that I now don't have the urge to buy every point and shoot camera that is paraded out on QVC or HSN that has a "wonderful" new feature like "low light or non-shake." This Canon has every good feature in the known universe and you can't outgrow it. Its a camera that will let you be as good as you can be, it won't hold you back. The battery life is great, the built in flash is good but I bought a 430EX and that's even better. I never figure I'm wasting money buying accessories for this camera as it will be my main squeeze for many years to come. I always missed my 35mm Canon slr's and now feel that I have an old friend back again, only much much better. Believe me, you can't go wrong getting this camera, its beyond description...
This is my third digital camera, I bought it after my tot dunked my previous camera under water.   I did a lot of research before I bought this and it was highly rated in Consumer Reports. ---  --- After a few months of ok pictures (the macro setting is not very good though) the lens cover started sticking but I learned to live with it.  I would manually open up the lens cover each time.  Then the lens cover got stuck in the open position and I was learning to live with that.   But now the camera is almost completely dead.  It will not power up properly and sometimes it beeps.  I'm not sure but I think I am out of the warranty period with this. ---  --- I will not buy another Canon Camera.  This camera was made too cheaply.  I wish things were not made to break right away
Among the various offerings available, this is perhaps the most complete. Each offerings has some unique capabilities that others don't possess; but if you want only one product this one gives you the closest match to a professional product that can be used by print shops
Just received radio yesterday, and am returning radio today! Pluses.... adequate LCD display and good illumination while on AC adapter. Good thumbwheel tuning in 1 Khz increments. Adequate speaker fidelity for small radio. However, the volume slew buttons have set "numbered" volume levels, and between settings of 5-6, there is a BIG noticeable increase in volume(not good), and while tuning shortwave bands, every approx 100Khz increment, there appears to be a "null" area, where signal meter reads a signal received, but quiet speaker. Also, on FM, if hands are near the radio, the signal breaks up(for weaker signals, not strong ones), and compared to my Grundig 400-PE, which I feel the sensitivity is not good and the hiss is bothersome, the Eton E-5 seems worse still!!! I am returning this today, and obtaining the Sony 7600GR instead. Eton E-5, not bad, but certainly not worth 3 stars or above, especially, if comparing it to another similar size radio, and then comparing it to my Sony 2010. 
As soon as I got this item, I tried it out right away.  I will agree the battery cover is rather flimsy but that's a minor point.  The real issue is whether it could do what it claims to do -- take down mosquitos and flys.  Sure enough, I killed 5 mosquitos after sitting outside for just a few minutes.  I also took down a housefly without any sweat.  This is a great device as mosquitos are a real problem where I'm at and it sucks being held hostage indoors by insects.  No more an issue
It's a little on the thin side for snowy or freezing weather, but great in keeping the chill off when you're out and about, or at the game. The blue is actually more of a royal blue than navy blue, but the lettering is well stitched and is the same quality used on MLB baseball caps (also has the MLB logo on back). It folds up easily and can be tucked into a jacket pocket with room to spare. The price is great and makes a great gift
I have had this for almost 6 months and I like it a lot.  Right off, it looks great.  Black leather, blue piping going around the edge.  The blue is that vivid color that one of those exotic/expensive fish tank fish have:  neons or tetras?  Whichever it is, it is very sharp looking. ---  --- I keep i860 cell phone in the 'Glove all the time.  It does not add much bulk/size/weight to the phone.  It fits it, after all, like a glove. ---  --- When I am taking a photo, I simply unsnap the half that is on the flip-up half of my cell phone which is where the camera lens is, take the photo, and slip it back on.   ---  --- Before I used to know about this, I used to press down a little strap on it that would get in the way, like a wayward lock of hair.  Turns out that futzing with the strap is unnecessary.  They designed it so you can just remove that half of the case, take photo(s), and snap it back on.  Smart. ---  --- In fact, the reason the strap is there in the first place is so you can easily remove the other half.  Look what is on the end of that strap before you curse it, guys.   It's a snap!  Snaps unsnap; that is what they are for. ---  --- The glove is well named.  It makes the phone much easier to grip in your hand.  I can easily pivot it around in my hand, flip it around, pick it up, and basically not expect it to skid around.  Without the 'Glove, you have a bare metal or plastic case.  Smooth looking and - well, maybe too smooth for something small and costing hundreds of dollars! ---  --- I like the fast release for the belt hook.  So far, it has not failed me.  I think it is at the bottom, not at the back the way some people have said, but I cannot remember for certain. I know it goes off and on easily for me but has never come off on its own yet. ---  --- I don't use it that way much though.  The i860 is not much bigger than one of those little matchbox cars from the 1960s. I easily fit it in my pocket.  With the glove on, I know it is probably not going to get scratched too easily
My boyfriend buys this magazine and likes it a lot. I also take a look at it because in addition to tastefully photographed beautiful women there are a lot of things in it that makes it very interesting even for women. For example, there are fresh articles about fashion, cars, gadgets, sex and even celebrities. I read them with interest and skip the models, which I guess are the main entertaining element in the magazine for the guys. Well, that's fine. I am a beautiful woman as well and my boyfriend doesn't rely only on tips from such magazines to keep me very satisfied but also on bestsellers such as scientfically guaranteed male multiple orgasms and ultimate sex. That's why I don't mind when he lists Maxim and enjoys the photographed beautiful women. Maxim can definitely satisfy the hunger for such eye candies of every man who has a strong and happy relationship without getting in trouble. Overall, it is a very good, high quality magazine, which has a lot to offer both as photographs and information, and I am sure that you will enjoy each issue.
Eventually, anyone who makes it their business to seek out quality horror movies is going to come to the conclusion that the ones that succeed in distinguishing themselves from the pack tend to fall into three distinct categories. First, you have the horror movies that are less interested in scaring you than they are seriously exploring their subject matter, and probing into the nature of evil. Sometimes, they go the supernatural route (The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, Don't Look Now). Sometimes, they stay grounded (Psycho, Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, Se7en). Either way, they are more disturbing than they are immediately frightening. You acknowledge that what you've seen has struck a kind of nerve, but you won't lose much sleep. These movies are  intellectually compelling but they do not provoke any immediate sense of terror. ---  --- On the other hand, the second breed of quality horror movies has no interest in psychology, in the "nature" of their content, and do not attempt to intellectually engage you. They only want to make you feel as if you are in immediate danger. The movies that fall into this category (Halloween, Alien) do not provide food for thought, but they know how to make you uncomfortable, and they know how to push your buttons. They are manipulative in the extreme, but they are actively frightening, and provide visceral experiences that the previous category of horror films cannot.  ---  --- Finally, the third category of superlative horror films distinguish themselves by remaining conscious of themselves. They want to frighten you, but they also want to convince you that they are "above" merely pushing your buttons. At the same time, they don't want to go the intellectual route either. These films (Scream, Dawn of the Dead) are made by people who know the genre, know that the audience knows the genre, and toe a thin line between adhering to genre conventions and examining those conventions explicitly. These films are very effective, even if they are too cool for the room. You laugh knowingly, and then, bam, something truly frightening wipes that smirk right off your face. ---  --- Bernard Rose's "Candyman" is a rarity in that it falls into all three of these categories. It is intellectually stimulating and it knows a great deal about the nature of evil, but it is also, truly, viscerally frightening. It is self-aware and yet, it is not too cool for the room, and there is no comfortable distance to be found from the nightmare that unfolds on the screen. It is as immediately frightening as the orginal Halloween, it is as thought-provoking as The Exorcist, and it is as aware as itself as the Scream trilogy. You've never seen anything quite like it before, and you probably won't see anything like it again. ---  ---  The plot of Candyman centers around a woman who is as much of an agnostic when it comes to the intangible world as one could imagine; she boldly pursues strides into the haunts of a malevolent spiritual force (the Cabrini Green Housing Projects in Chicago, which are dangerous enough without factoring evil spirits into the equation) in search of discovering the source of the legend of the Candyman, a man with a hook for an arm who can be summoned by repeating his name into a mirror five times. She is convinced, as any liberal pseudo-sociologist might be, that the Candyman is but a projection of the fears the urban poor have of gang/drug-related violence. The fact that there is a gang leader who has taken to calling himself the Candyman reinforces this conviction. ---  --- For this woman, the idea that there is evil in the world, pure evil, unconditioned by economic/racial (most of the residents of Cabrini Green are poor and black) factors is unthinkable. She does not believe that the Candyman is anything more than an idea. She is wrong. The Candyman is real, and he doesn't much like the challenge to his authority posed by her skepticism. Furthermore, she reminds him of someone from his past whom he wishes to be reunited with, and thus he comes to view her as a conquest on more levels than one. ---  --- For about half of the film, we follow the woman, played by Virginia Madsen, and her friend, played by Kasi Lemmons, as they trek through Cabrini, exchange notes, and conduct the affairs of their lives. Madsen's grad student is no different from a lot of young people. She is determined to make a mark on her field, she's a little suspicious about her husband's fidelity, she smokes, she's pretty, she's intelligent and she seems nice enough. She draws our sympathy. ---  --- However, midway through the film, there is a decisive rupture, and everything in Madsen's life begins to unravel at an alarming rate. The chain of events that follow a particularly frightening scene in a parking lot take on the logic of a nightmare that one is unable to escape from. Soon, everything we have come to know about the young woman we've been following, all of the connections she has to her friends, to her husband, to humanity in general seem to be undone. It would be unfair to describe exactly what happens, but let it be said that the final fifty minutes of Candyman are as frightening as anything I've seen on film. ---  --- We thought we were safe, after all. The character we'd been following had friends, family, a job, a life of her own. The possibility of coming into conflict with nothing less than pure evil was the farthest thing from her mind; she and her friend were more concerned about packing the requisite mace for their journey through the projects, more afraid of drug dealers than of demons. After all, the Candyman is an urban legend, and we know all about urban legends. They're campfire stories. There is no Boogeyman, not really.  ---  --- Rose plays on the self-conscious approach we take to horror films by decisively arguing that it will not save us. He engages us intellectually by toying with the idea of whether the Candyman is literally real, or only becomes literally real if enough people are afraid of him (I'll leave that up to you to decide). And he frightens us at an immediate level by pulling the rug out from under us at a crucial moment, and by never allowing us to regain our footing. It doesn't hurt that he has an uncanny eye for frightening visuals (the bees swallowing the Chicago skyline, the Candyman's self-portrait), plus the help of a terrific soundtrack from Philip Glass (whose presence reminds us that, hey, this is a serious piece of art) and compelling performances on all levels. Not to mention a great idea, and, yes, the ability to push our buttons and manipulate us when he wants to. ---  --- Candyman is, as far as I'm concerned, the second most frightening film ever made; the original Halloween still remains the only movie that made me briefly fear for my own safety. But I would argue that the horror genre has produced no more complete work of art-- no other film that engages the viewer on every conceivable level they could ask to be engaged on-- than Rose's masterpiece. Halloween becomes exponentially less scary with repeated viewings, as you begin to get the sequence down and figure out what's coming. Candyman's power remains undiminished, even once you get the sequence down, because the scares give way to the ideas.  ---  --- Don't miss it.  ---  --- Rated R: Contains some very graphic gore (nothing that will  really surprise those used to the genre, but this movie does get pretty ugly by any standard-- seriously, who said this wasn't gory enough?) some language, and brief nudity (not in a sexual context)
It Could Happen to You was a bit of a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Nicolas Cage, Bridget Fonda, and Rosie Perez among others. --- The movie brings to the screen the story of a policeman who after winning 4 million dollars on the NY state lotto, decides to share half of it with a waitress he met the previous day.   --- The acting is surprisingly (!) below average, the dialogues are way below average, while the plot is not bad at all.   --- Nicolas Cage's character is too naive and too slow, and that was just sad/pitiful! --- Bridget Fonda was unexpectedly plain and bland. --- Rosie Perez's character was overly exaggerated to the point that it got tiring AND annoying very early on. --- As for Wendell Pierce and Stanley Tucci this film does not seem to be their thing; they don't seem to belong.  Subsequently, they are not convincing in their roles at all. --- Finally, somebody shoot the "Narrator," PLEASE! --- Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...  No masterpiece here. --- If Nicolas Cage is what you had in mind, check out the AMAZING movies City of Angels and/or The Family Man.
I use PowerPoint a great deal as a teacher and thought this would upgrade my presentations. Unfortunately, every one of my computers had insufficient video memory to allow the software to work. For now, it sits on my shelf until I can purchase more powerful equipment. Certainly not for the casual user. It isn't the magic black box that will make you a star
I recieved this item yesterday.  Initaly I was very happy, it changed my 8GB black ipod into a green ipod and did a rather good job of it.  The inner skin is a clear white-ish frosted color allowing the original ipod color to show through, I would have preferred an opaque white, but it did not look terribly bad with the green, though blue, red, or any other color than green would have been better with the black I had not the inital foresight to picture this. I was still pretty happy at this point. The hip-clip was removed right away, I have been looking for a nano cover that would allow me to dock to my Logitech MM50 (portable speaker)  without taking it out of the case, eureka, this case did that, without the clip of course.  The lanyard was an added bonus until earlier today I discovered the clips that held the lanyard in place had widened the aperature connections on the iPod nano, so that I would never trust it on the lanyard for fear it would fall off and be lost.  Well, I was still happy with the color change and the ability to sit in my portable speakers without taking it off. Unitl, I discovered a surface scratch on the green coloring of the case. Now, despite the fact that this is the "Aluminum" iSkin Duo, this was not the case at all.  The green metalic colored plastic is painted with an aluminum look.  Okay that was still acceptable, until, I discovered what looked to be a surface layer peeling off, sugesting that eventualy the color would flake away. That was it, that was the broke back camel inducement, and now I am the proud owner of a case that I will never be happy with. At first I had been all excited, and was considering the purchase of other colors, not now, this in my consideration was a waste of money. Hopefully I'll confirm that my ipod can still link to the cradle inspite of the clip damage the lanyard has done. ---  --- Sincerly --- Ro
Pocky are good if your a new to the japanese sugar covered biscut style of food. i perfer yan yan i believe they have more substance. but are more messy if you dont have biscut dipping skills. 
Great flavored soup that you don't have to start from scratch.  Very healthy choice
The pins for the curlers are awkward and hard to use.  I don't like them
While I personally love and eat tons of organic and natural foods, I have to say the $30 I spent on this case of cookies was a waster.  Neither of my children will eat them, nor will I.  They have a smell that once you get in your nose hinders any attempt at enjoying the very small bit of flavor they have.  Nature's Path makes great cereal and energy bars but fall short with these cookies.  Stick with the chocolate or peanut butter and you are okay.  The honey grahams will sit in your cupboard until trash day
There was a click in the crankshaft that was loud enough to be heard while riding and felt by the foot through the left pedal every 360 degrees of pedal rotation. ---  --- I purhased a crank puller tool for $21.44 (incl tax), a crank wrench for $18.18 (incl. tax), and grease for $6.38 to repair this brand new bicycle. ---  --- Upon disassembly I found two (2) metal shavings, each about 0.25 inches in size, that appeared to be from drilling.  I have saved the two (2) metal shavings. ---  --- I removed the metal shavings, cleaned and re-greased, and the clicking noise and vibration was fixed. ---  --- Since this was a brand new bicycle, it would seem reasonable to reimburse me for the tools required to repair it.  The total cost, not including and labor, is $46.00.
When you have dirt in your food you have to wonder about what you are really eating. Otherwise the flavor wasn't bad. I just can't eat the dirt. It's bad for the teeth
I wear it almost everyday and it's a lot of fun to change out the wrist band
The singing is terrible on "Fly Me To The Moon".  Don't take my word for it.  Listen to the free sample supplied by Amazon.com .  At 16 seconds into it, when she sings "all I worship and adore", she goes almost a whole note sharp for several notes!  Even someone with no musical training can hear it. ---  --- The rest of the pieces sound fine
I didn't think it was difficult to set up but it clearly isn't designed well.  The target that hangs inside the cage doesn't actually fit.   And..... the netting doesn't stop the balls.  How's that for a good product.  1 out of 5 balls rips right through the net.   ---  --- Buy anything else
I love my Birkenstock shoes.  They fill great.  I am a registered nurse. I am on my feet constantly all day.  These shoes are great for the support my feet need.  They are really comfortable. I will definately be purchasing more in the near future. 
Every mother/father should definitely purchase a baby monitor. Until this came I could not leave my baby while she slept to go do the dishes and what not. The receiver side is battery operated, so even if I walk around the house I can here my baby. Even the smallest sound is picked up! Amazing. I haven't tried other monitors, but this one is perfect and inexpensive, so I would recommend it to anyone
Not really being into the original GTA III (and its birds-eye-view predecessors), I became unfortunately addicted to to San Andreas. The game play is absorbing and the storyline and cinematics are, despite the dated graphics, engaging. Maybe the most impressive aspect of the entire game is the impressive cinematic scene voice acting, which makes you forget about some of the jerky animations. ---  --- The game play is free-ranging, but if you don't pursue the main storyline missions (which are linear, but multiple storylines let you pursue them in any priority) the gratuitous violence you can commit is ultimately unrewarding and difficult to get away with (as it should be). The moral criticisms of the game include being able to randomly assault innocent bystanders without repurcussions, but for the most part, there are repurcussions if nearby police see you doing so. My criticism would be that there are not enough repurcussions for street violence, because it would certainly make that aspect of the game more challenging. If you go on a rampage in a local store, the clerks don't try to call the police or evade. They instead just take a beating or a bullet. The AI of some of the rival gangs is a little clumsy too, as they will simply start shooting at you if they see your colors, despite the presence of squad cars or bike cops across the street. The cops in San Andreas are corrupt, but not that corrupt. ---  --- GTA SA definitely feels like a ported title rather than a game developed for PC. Some of the interface and in-game menus are awkward and designed to be PS2 gamepad friendly. Saving the game is a bit of a pain as well, since you have to retreat to your "safe-house" to save everytime. ---  --- A fun and engrossing game for adults, but let this be known: if you let your under-18 child play this game, you are an awful parent and deserve to have social services come and whisk your precious babies away. Aside from the violence, San Andreas is rife with profanity and innuendo, and is probably not really suitable for anyone under 40. There is no "safe" mode or low-gore level for this game like some other titles (while the game is overly violent, gore is minimal anyway)
This was purchased for my daughter for her 15th Birthday.  She is very deeply interested in Shakespeare and all his works but especially Romeo and Juliet.  I saw this version when it was released originally in theaters and wanted her to have the experience of seeing these 2 actors.  I thought it was beautifully done then and she loves it now.  Impressive that Mom and daughter enjoy this movie when the music of today's teens and much of their other interests are definitely not Mom's thing. 
the mia series are great for our family.  the kids always look forward to playing their mia games.  they have the math adventure and grandmas remedy.  the two disc thing is confusing...but really doesn't interrupt play.  the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because it can be a little glitchy sometimes...mia will get stuck somewhere and not respond.  we just go back to a game saved in a similar spot and restart.  so it's not too big a deal.
I bought the game for my daughter, but I play it more than she does. This game will give you hours of enjoyment if you love Super Mario Bros
This movie starts off blazing hot and ends up ice cold.  Martin does a great job with Nick Nolte as an artist in "life lessons" and i thought after this story that i was in for a real treat of a film but after watching Ford Coppolas somthing Zoe i began to tire and by the end of Woody Allens snoozefest i was bored stiff.  My advice is to watch the first 30 minutes and then turn this one off.  The first 30 minutes is GREAT film followed but very average film and ending with truley awful film. 
This cover is what my "baby blackberry" needed to be protected and safe
Flavored coffee creamers have been a guilty pleasure of mine for a long time now, but even if you buy the sugar-free kind, you're ingesting a whopping 1 gram of fat per tablespoon of creamer. As if that weren't bad enough, it's partially HYDROGENATED!  --- Splenda Flavor Blends is a wonderful alternative if you're like me and just can't face black coffee. Please note that this is not a creamer. It sweetens/flavors coffee. If you find you just have to have creamer to "tame" down your coffee you can add a Splenda Flavor blend and a splash of skim milk or if you like things more creamy, buy some powdered non-fat milk and add that along with the Splenda Flavor blends. --- Lots of times, I find products with Splenda already in them to be too sweet but I didn't think that was the case with this. All three of the available flavors (hazelnut, mocha, vanilla) taste great without being overpowering.  --- Finally, now I can kick that fatty creamer bad habit!
I received this 2CD set in the mail and was horrified at the sound quality of the so called "mastering".  I have original un-mastered copies of some REO Speedwagon albums that sound BETTER than this set!  I love REO to death and the track listing is good to go, but in all honesty, this compilation falls flat on its face in regards to sound quality.  The band seriously needs to find a good remasterer and give the fans what they have been waiting for.  I cannot recommend any previous greatest hits releases that even come close.  Save your money and wait
This is a great foodie magazine. We think the writing is what makes it great. It is always interesting, has some recipes to try and is not the usual food mag stuff. Very enjoyable
This is the best long-wearing lipstick I have ever bought. It lasts on me for about 6-7 hours...through meals, drinks, etc. The best part is that it isn't flakey. It also has little hints of "glitter" in it, that really make your lips shine. The icing on the cake is that it has a subtle watermelon smell.
I've had my Treo for a month and heavily use it for many applications, I especially love having the Goodlink email application, my family videos, mp3's, pics, and all my office documents at a touch of a finger. Yes the battery life goes quickly but I don't mind charging my treo every night. ---  --- The slick and slim design is a real eye catcher and feel great in the hand.[...] ---  --- in the one month of usage, my Treo has hung, one time, a simple reset fixed it and hasn't hung since
This is absolutely the best concealer EVER. I have skin that is very sensitive and prone to breakouts with face makeup - this stuff hasn't been a problem! It stays put all day long, and does not shine
Manufacturer would be better off providing extra legs, as this device is very fragile.  Not a good consumer product
These socks are a bit on the thin side, but they withstand a lot of wear
One thing which mystifies me is how few people have embraced the latest in modern clock technology: radio controlled clocks which keep exact time by automatically synchronizing themselves with signals broadcast from the incredibly accurate U.S. atomic clock in Boulder Colorado. Such clocks are not only always accurate to a fraction of a second, they also automatically set themselves to and from daylight savings and standard time as appropriate. Furthermore, such clocks are typically quite reasonable in price. Yet while most Americans have, for example, the latest in modern cordless phones and cell phones, relatively few have the accuracy and convenience of radio controlled clocks. This model is just one of many styles sold by Amazon and other vendors. Try one and I think you'll be glad you did. My wife and I have several of these clocks throughout our house and take accurate time for granted, no what time system is in effect
The sound quality was excellent, but the earpiece is flimsy and irreplacable: terrific electrical engineering, poor mechanical engineering. ---  --- I loved it when it wasn't broken.  Even wind didn't seem to bother the headset much.  The voice quality was great on transmission and reception.  But the earpiece is incredibly flimsy and can't be replaced.  I got a new headset the first time on warranty.  The second time it broke I could have gotten a free replacement again but I didn't want the hassle.  I have a Scala now that I've been using for months and I'm very happy with it, even though the sound and wind-immunity doesn't measure up to the Logitech
This is the only feeder that attracts hummingbirds to our door.  We had birds eating right at the glass slider on the front deck all summer long!  The birds loved it and my family did too
Did you lose interest in new rock in the past several years because all those loud songs on the FM station sound about the same?  Maybe you noticed one song in there somewhere that had memorable hooks and interesting lyrics among the crunching guitars?  The Libertines are - or at least were - one of those diamonds in the rough. ---  --- Their raw, loud style is closer to punk than any other genre, but most of their songs are more well-developed than that suggests and might even appeal to classic rock fans.  Make no mistake, though, this is a loud album.  With the exception of the oddly balladish "Radio America," it's a pretty steady sonic assault, and the lyrics are mostly somewhere between "Louie Louie" and live Dylan on the intelligibility scale.  What can be understood is more erudite than you'd expect, though.  "What a Waster" is a frighteningly vivid look at drug addiction, "Boys in the Band" is the best groupie song I've heard in a long time, and "The Good Old Days" actually reveals a touch of sentimentality just under the power chords.  Decipherable or not, most of the other songs are at least very catchy.  The whole collection is a nice balance between aggressive style and memorable songs that has been all too lacking for a long time now. 
The beautiful young Brooke Shields plays 11/12 year old Violet, daughter of Hattie (Susan Sarandon) a New Orleans prostitute living and working in a brothel in 1917. Violet has been raised in the brothel and has not been to school and has known no other life or anything about the outside world. When she turns 12, her virginity is auctioned off. Brooke Shields' portrayal of Violet is poignant and beautiful. Her childish charms and innocence are so heart-wrenchingly sweet. The scene where she jumps up and down on the photographer's bed (very childlike) and asks him whether he will take care of her before throwing her arms around him and giving him small childlike kisses on the nose, forehead etc. and reciting that little rhyme really pulled at my heart strings! I just wanted to jump into the TV and give her a hug!! This, mixed with the seductive adult things that she also says in this scene (and others) is particularly poignant as we know that young Violet is merely reciting what she's heard from the prostitutes. The photographer also says that Violet doesn't know what she's saying. You just want to turn the clock back, hug Violet and give her a proper childhood! The photographer marries her because he's fascinated with her beauty, innocence and is concerned that she is only a child and should not be in a brothel becoming a prostitute. The part where he gives her a doll is poignant as she has already lost her virginity and it seems that he's trying to give back her childhood, sadly she's been exposed to too much, too soon in her life. Susan Sarandon and Brooke Shields are wonderful in this movie as well as Keith Carradine, the photographer. The art aspect & music soundtrack are amazing. This movie deals with a taboo subject seen through the eyes of a child as 'normal' which enhances poignancy and brings out the viewers maternal need to 'rescue' young Violet.
This bracelet looks better than the picture.  It looks beautiful on my wrist. The fifty bucks that I paid for it was a real bargain. I love it. There's only one drawback, it's 8 inches long and that's too long for my wrist. If it fit perfectly, I'd give it ten stars. I'll pay to make it smaller. It's made of titanium, and maybe it's too tough to alter. I want it to fit over that knot on my wrist. If I can get it altered, I'll wear it until the day I die, which I hope will be 100 years from now
This product is very easy to install and use. In couple of minutes, I was able to set it up. I used the phone jack to input the music from cassette player to the computer and it worked well.  --- The reason I give it four star out of five is that it records the music in wave format and there is no software in the package that converts wave file to DVD/CD/MP3 format
Excellent price and quick shipping. This was the best available for 3.4 oz size
This movie is pure fun.  My whole family loved it.  It's corny and the acting leaves you feeling like it's amatuer hour, but its fun to watch.  We made popcorn and laughed our way through the whole thing.  Watch it and enjoy
The "crema" was pretty thick as it brewed, and the coffee appeared to have a nice dark color. We got a nice strong aroma of coffee and preceded to add some milk (1%) and sugar.  ---  --- Our first impressions...good flavor...a nice cup of coffee. We did enjoy the cup of coffee ---  --- We don't know of any other pod maker that has this flavor and it's really good! We love the way it smells - the way it tastes - and the fact it is just plain different. Most pod people are ignoring the flavored sector to this extent - and it's nice to have a cup of really flavored coffee! Review from singleservecoffee.com --- 
We have had this weather station for a year now an more times then not there are absolutely no readings!  I only get an indoor reading, which I could get from my thermostat!  We have reset it, messed with the sensors, moved it around the house in many locations with a direct site on the outdoor sensors and still no readings.  Its very frusterating when its a hurricane outside and you can't get any wind readings.  This junk cost me a couple of hundred dollars and was a very dissapointing birthday present for my husband!  Also I called customer service and was on hold for over a hour and still never got a human to talk to for help!  Don't buy this product!!
  This reveals a great deal about Vietnam and the 1960's. --- Should be prized by students of Kennedy, Johnson, and our military history in the nuclear age
Reasons to buy it: ---  --- 1. Cheap, a mere $140. --- 2. Packed with features. From complete auto mode (point and shoot) to fully manual mode. 4MP and 3X optical zoom good enough for most situations. --- 3. Picture quality is good. It's better than the other two cameras I own (Olympus C720 UZ and Sony DSC S600). --- 4. Compact. It's smaller than it looks in the stock photo. --- 5. Fast. Switches on and is ready for the first shot within about 1.5 seconds. ---  ---  --- Other things I liked about the camera: ---  ---  - Good ergonomics. Fits nicely in my hand, all the buttons are well placed and easy to access. I can even switch on the camera and take pictures with one hand. ---  - Powerful flash. Enough to fill up a moderate size room. ---  - Great video mode with sound. It also comes with an audio video cable so that you can connect the camera to your TV and watch the vidoes and pictures on your TV. ---  - LCD is decent size and is fairly bright, which means it's even visible outdoors in the daytime. ---  ---  --- Things I didn't like about the camera: ---  ---  - Manual could be more detailed. There is a bsaic manual and sort of a quick start guide. But there was no 40 page booklet which explained each and every feature in detail. ---  - The auto focus illuminator (for help in focussing in low light) is a little bright and can be annoying sometimes. But the upside is that you get good focus even in really low light conditions. ---  - Does not come with a battery charger. I bought rechargeable batteries and a charger separately. ---  ---  --- I have owned the Olympus C720 UZ and the newer Sony DSC S600, but I think this camera is better than both of them.
They are a nice compact size for travel. They work as advertised, just expect to let them heat up longer than the stated "quick curl" time
QuickBooks is an incredible product. If you have never used it before try having someone walk you through it
After reading the reviews here and at [...] on this baby, I was a little cocerned about its low-light and indoor performance.  Let me be the first to say that my fears were largely unfounded. ---  --- Yes, if you film in very low light, it will darken many colors.  But we're talking 60 lux, which is the roughly equivalent to the light put off from the candles of a birthday cake.  Just keep the lights on when your kid blows out the candles, and viola!  Seriously, I have had absolutely no problems with it filming too dark indoors, outdoors, or even when I film local bands playing in dark bars. ---  --- The reason I wanted to try this camera was because it is the only flash-based camera that is receiving even mildly positive reviews.  I do not want a tape mechanism that will break, nor a fragile hard drive that cannot be used in many film-worthy conditions (think snow skiing, as the drive mechanism will freeze up on you in very cold weather).   ---  --- As I said, I was skeptical when I purchased it, but no more.  The videos are far better than any other camcorder I've owned.  My last was a Canon ZR 50 mini DV, and this camera takes VASTLY superior videos than that one. ---  --- The four stars is only because of the mpeg2 format this records to.  I have a mac, so editting requires that I convert to DV with streamclip so that imovie can import the movies.  Mainly, I just don't edit my home videos so that hasn't been a problem.  But if would have been nice for it to be an easier option, and it could have been if they encoded to mpeg4 with h264 and mp3/aac, which appears to be the next standard.   ---  --- If that concerns you, or if you want HD, you might wait until the Panasonic SD1 is available because it records in AVHDC which is a form of mpeg4.  Of course, imovie doesn't yet support that either, so you may have to wait until iLife 07 to really use it.   ---  --- In parting, I will also mention that the size of this unit is absolutely fabulous.  I no longer dread lugging around even my smallish mini DV camera.  This thing literally fits in my jacket pocket, so I end up filming a lot more than I did with previous cameras.  If you're looking for small, flash-based, and good quality video, get this camera, you'll love it
I bought these earrings for my 10-year old grandaughter for Christmas.  I think she has worn them everyday since - she loves them.  They are not large hoops; if fact, they are a bit small -- but perfect for her. For an adult, I think a little bit larger size would be better. All in all, I was very pleased with the earrings; the quality is very good.
For those reviewers who have not seen the remakes, see DAIL M FOR MURDER by Alfred Hitchcock, PERFECT MURDER starring Michael Douglas and Gyneth Paltrow, not to mention countless TV movies of the week. ---  --- This is the original and the best.Barbara Stanwyck is superb, as is Burt Lancaster. Moody and dark and suspenseful.
I thought this product had reasonably good taste, but I have two major issues with it. ---  --- First, they describe this as a  Kettle Corn.  It is not Kettle Corn - not even close.  This is a caramel corn with a thick sweet coating.  Real Kettle Corn is a slightly sweet, slightly salty popcorn. ---  --- Second, each very small bag has 1.5 servings in it.  When was the last time you opened a small bag of snack food and only ate 2/3's of it?  They purposely made the serving size unrealistic to make it look healthier.  The whole point of paying for individual size bags is that it limits you to a set portion.  Remember when a can of Coke had 1.5 servings in it?  The FDA made them change the label. If you eat the whole bag, you are eating 200 calories of popcorn.  No better that a bag of potato chips or a few cookies, so this is not a lesser evil - it's just the same old junk food with a new name. ---  --- I won't buy this product again.  It's the same stuff you can get anywhere
The front wheels came off the first day...Christmas Day! Very frustrating!
I bought an epilator because I was tired of shaving my legs and waxing was just too expensive for me.  I've had my epilator for several weeks now and I am already seeing amazing results!   ---  --- I used it for the first time on my legs.  I'm not going to lie...It was painful.  I just made sure to go slowly, pausing every few inches, and making sure my skin was pulled as tightly as I could get it.  Eventually, I was able to get most of the thick, dark hairs off of my legs.   ---  --- **Please know that the Epilator is not an immediate "cure-all".  Hair grows in stages, so as soon as you get rid of some hairs, several more grow in behind them.  (Eventually you can probably get rid of most to all of them, but it will take some time.)  Because of this, it is good to try epilating a couple of times a week.  Since it's winter, I just let it all grow out so that the Epilator can get more hairs.  However, when new hair grows in, I am finding that they are thinner and blonde instead of dark brown.  It doesn't hurt nearly as much to pull those out!  I also know that I'll be able to do this in the spring and summer because the hair is lighter.  My legs are smoother and I don't get razor burn!  Right after epilating, sometimes I do experience a little irritation but, unlike razor burn, it goes away after just a short time.     ---  --- Another neat thing is that, unlike waxing, the Epilator can grab the teeny tiny almost invisible hairs.  This gives your skin a smoother feel and it gets hairs at the beginning stages of growth!  I used to have to wait two weeks or so for my hair to grow long enough to be waxed.  Now, I get smoother skin just about whenever I want to!     ---  --- I was a little nervous at first about spending money on a product I had not heard much about.  With the exception of the few reviews I read online, I was pretty much in the dark.  I went ahead and went for it, then realized that this thing paid for itself in about two weeks!  Not only have I epilated my legs, I have also used it under my arms, on my upper lip, and on my bikini line.  The results have been better than I could have imagined!!   ---  --- Again, I'm not going to lie...OUCH!!!!!  Epilating under my arms hurt initially and they were sore for a few days (I have very thick hairs).  However, I got the majority of the hairs and after the first time, I realized that I'm never going to have to shave again!  Yes, some little blonde hairs grow back, but they are ALL thinner and much less painful.  In fact, sometimes it tickles a little.  :o)  I epilate there once to twice a week (about a five minute job if you're being careful, two if you're in a hurry) and I have smoother underarms!   ---  --- I used to get my upper lip waxed about once a month.  Now I just epilate.  It hurts, but just for a second.  Plus, I keep up with it so instead of 50 hairs being pulled at once with hot wax, I only need to pull 5-10 each time.     ---  --- **A word of caution: Our skin is more sensitive in some areas, so if you choose to epilate around the bikini line, be careful.  I managed to give myself a burn from going too slowly with the rotating "blade".  Now I just make sure that I don't leave it in one place for more than a couple of seconds.  If I miss some hairs, I come back another time to get them. ---  --- This epilator comes with a little loufa pad to help reduce ingrown hairs (I've only had a few and the pad fixes them) and a little cleaning brush.  The epilator is very easy to clean.  The top (dark purple section) pops off and you run it under hot water.  When it dries, you put it back on.  **Note, the epilator does not store hairs inside of it.  When they are pulled out, they tend to either gather on the front of the epilator (I stop periodically to wipe them off) or they go flying.  I sit on a towel when epilating to catch most of the hairs.   ---  --- I hope this review was helpful to you with your decision about buying an epilator.  I am very satisfied with this product and I recommend it to anyone who has at least a little pain tolerance and really wants to get rid of hair stop having to shave all the time.   ---  --- **Are the few minutes of pain worth it???  ABSOLUTELY!  :o) ---  ---     --- 
Shoe is comfortable but the description says off white or white with beige.  Which leads you to think the color is mostly white.  The true color is neither!  There is absolutely NO WHITE in these shoes.  I purchased these shoes because I needed some white off/white shoes NOT beige shoes.  No I did not return them it's too much of a hassel to return things so I kept them and I have worn them once but do not like the color at all.  The style is not as cute as her others but they are still a great bargain.  The materials are an excellent quality.  If you like beige & earthtones you will like these shoes
I am glad I purchased my Cardscan 700, but there are some significant unfortunate missed opportunities and because of that some important functions cannot be done at all.  My impression is that this is the best product on the market, due to its scanning properties, which are quite good.  There are some serious deficiencies though in the rest of the software which would be nice to have fixed, and which in some cases render the device somewhat useless, since the output cannot be transferred to a useful place. ---  --- PROs: It does a pretty good job of scanning.  The algorithm is well developed and is actually quite impressive.  Even cards that catch and rotate as they go through, producing a funny smeared image, have some of their contents scanned correctly.  The superiority of this recognition software is the strong point of this product.  There is also an ok database management product that one can use to maintain and look up cards.  Operationally the product is especially nice- I can just sit there feeding cards in and typing carriage return after each one, glancing at the screen to catch errors.  The card image is retained in the record in the Cardscan database, which is important.  ---  --- CONs: 1) the exit path has places that cards can hang up, and they can catch as they go through.  This happens fairly often unless the card is new and flat, so part of the operation is to try to prevent that, by straightening out bent corners ahead of time, and by adding a little force keep the card from catching and rotating as one corner goes forward and the other is stuck.  Quite needless- if the exit path was smooth and continuous, this wouldn't happen - the problem is in the rear of the plastic case.  2) Although the product retains the image of the business card, there's no way to pass that through to Outlook or export it to any other format.  This is very unfortunate.  I could laboriously do that by hand by cutting and pasting each one, except that Cardscan software does not permit copy / paste functions on the image.  Why not?  It's easy to implement.  3) Every time I start the program it harasses me about registering, even though I've been specific that I do not wish to.  It also harasses me about logging in the online backup facility even though I've asked it not to do that.  It therefore ignores the user wishes.  4) The data exchange function allows only extremely crude export to a file, in a simple text or csv format.  There is no way to create an Outlook format .pst file, which would simplify importing, and allow for the future option of including an image.  Outlook can hold an image in the comment section of the record, but apparently Cardscan folks aren't even close to thinking about this.  5) If I indicate that a data export for a file is destined for Outlook, the field names are not set up correctly, so unless I do some heavy editing of field names, nothing much other than the contact name gets across.  If I export directly to the running Outlook program, it isn't perfect, but it's close enough to be usable.  Why did Cardscan get one right and not the other??  In neither case can I send the card image over.  6) I was forced to install Microsoft .NET software even though I intended to do all my exports via files.  I didn't get a choice- if I didn't install .NET, the installer stopped and exited without installing any Cardscan software.
When the grill arrived, my husband put it together right away.  I am glad he did.  It was very unstable.  I would be afraid of cooking anything on it.  We packaged it back up and sent it right back
First of all, it seems a bit silly to defend the smell of any product, as everyone has different oppinions on this. I happen to love the smell, but I am writing this review to talk about what this product actually does; which is transforms hair. I have naturally curly hair, and awhile back I chopped it all off on a hairdresser's suggestion. When my hair was an inch long, it wasn't hard to fight my hair type. Now that I'm in the process of growing it out, my hair has been pretty annoyed at the contant blow drying, dying, and straightening I have subjected it to. Regardless of the cut, my hair has been limp and fried. After using this product along with Big shampoo, my hair has been absolutely transformed. People have commented on my hair ever since I have started using these wonderful products. Now to the issue of price: before using Lush, I was using bumble and bumble wich goes for 20 bucks a pop, as well as various styling products that ran in the similar price range... since using Lush, I have no need for styling products, therefore making these purchases very economical. I can't say enough great things about this brand
i love this product...it is so well worth the money if you're experiencing a skin problem.  easy to use, portable, no lotions or creams needed...just my little leather case
Excellent product works as advertised and so simple to use. Product well packaged, arrived earlier than expected and in mint condition. ScanSoft responded with an eMail in a timely fashion acknowledging receipt of my Rebate paperwork and provided a pin number for me to access their site to check on it's progress. But you know Rebates....they take forever! --- PDF Converter 4 is not my only ScanSoft Product. I also use Paperport 10 and am extremely satisfied with that. --- My buying experience has always been positive with Amazon.com vendors, never a problem. --- John Mc Laughlin --- Daytona Beach, Florid
Better than any club shop product.  Perfect for the new golfer and light enough my son did not get tired carrying them for 9 holes
I bought this for my boyfriend as his Valentine's day gift. He loved it! It 's a great price for this watch as well.
I am an experienced computer user, and I bought this primarily on my previous experince with Symantec products, which had been good.  My experience with this product was unfortunately, very poor. ---  --- First - the product claims to be able to clone your boot partition, but this failed repeatedly, creating cloned partitions which were not bootable.   ---  --- Second - Tech support failed to provide an answer for days while I eventually figured out myself that I needed to use the bootable media to make a clone of my system disk - something the windows application was happy to try and fail at without warning.  Even when I attempted to provide this information to tech support so they could answer similar questions for others, they didn't get what I was saying and sent me another form letter response detailing how to make a copy (instructions which failed of course). ---  --- Third - On another occasion, even using the bootable media, I got the error "1517" when attempting to clone by boot partition.  Searching the web revealed others having this problem, and Symantec tech support full of bogus solutions for it. ---  --- Fourth - no support for USB/Firewire drives with the bootable media. ---  --- On the plus side - it did resize partitions I asked it to without trouble (I give it one extra star for something working)
Did not fit well AT ALL.  WAY too big around the ankles - every step I took, the boot would start to fall off.  They were the right size, length wise and all, just way too wide above my ankle.  They were about half as tall as they looked in the photo, which was very disappointing.  I sent the boot back at my own expense the same day.  I would definatly recommend finding a boot you like in the store so you can try it on first, then ordering it off of here for cheaper. 
It is very hard to update the remote. Very seldom we can delete and if there are two DVR boxes remote get confused and keep on turning off and on, even though we choose the right one such as A or B.Software update is cumbersome and take 45 minutes on a Intel Quad computer with 2 G memory. Can supply some patches. I have the remote sitting on my coffee table useless.
This bag was not what I expected.  The leather was cheap and it wasn't really big enough to fit much.  I would not recommend this bag if you want it to hold a lot of items/paper. 
We got this toybox for our daughter when she turned one.  We love that it doesn't have any sharp corners or hinges to get fingers stuck inside.  It still looks like new 6 month later so it is very durable. If your child likes to get inside it like ours does there is no worry about them breaking it since the bottom is fabric.  We also really like the pockets in front for storing smaller items- we always stick her favorite dolls and animals in there.  We don't use the cover so that she can get the toys herself and it works perfect for us.  Highly recommend! 
The best money I've spent in a long while; got a great bargain at Amazon.com!  Food turns out delicous and it is easy to keep clean.  Charcoal grillers unite!  This is an excellent grill for a small family
The no-name comedians at the beginning were funny, Bea Arthur killed, and the dumpy lady at the end who kept talking about how African-Americans used to dig her backside but don't any longer was funny. Courtney Love's antics were amusing but grew tiresome. The rest of the roast was horrible. Telling Tommy Lee that his genitals are the envy of barnyard animals is not an insult. And, after it's repeated ad nauseum, it's not funny either. ---  --- Has Andy Dick ever been funny? Kimmel? Corolla? Sarah Silverman? Spade post-Farley? No. It's as if Comedy Central corralled the most unfunny comedians of the past 10 years. ---  --- And the bonus features are horrible. The interviewer was annoying--even the guests seemed annoyed with her. ---  --- Was Gilbert Gottfried not available? That guy is funny
Our son is 2 y.o. and had a great time with this puzzle. Enjoy all the animals 
Makuta is Sooooooo cool! I love his giant staff/pitchfork.I think he is one of the best Bionicles there is! Probably the only thing that stands in his way is the exo- body special Bionicle
These slippers are very comfy and fit true to size.  However, the fabric  part between the toes is not anchored to the solid part of the slipper.  It's sewn to the terry lining covering this solid part and when I walk, the slippers fall off my feet. I will not purchase these slippers again.  
I used this product this morning for the first time.  I washed my hair, blew it dry, most of the way, then rubbed the product in my hands and lightly distributed it throughout my hair.  The best way for me to describe it, is that, it is like a creamy hairspray.  Yes, it is tacky, like hairspray can be, but that's how it helps you get the style you want.  What I like about how it works on my hair, is that it really tamed the frizzes and brought down the "big" hair look that I usually have after blowing my thick hair dry.  I think it would also work well on the days that I blow my hair out.  I would probably blow it out first, then apply some dirt to help tame and smooth it.  I can see where it might make thinner, straighter hair a bit limp, so be careful not to use very much. ---  --- Edit:  I think it is best to apply to slightly damp hair, that might help with the people that are having trouble applying it to completely dry hair
I didn't like the only other Dean Koontz book I've ever read, Watchers, but I enjoy reading Kevin Anderson's stuff so I thought I'd give Koontz another try because I'm a reasonable person and I understand that not everyone can like everything by an author.  On to the review:  I realize that this book was initially meant to be a screenplay but I think the authors would have been wise to rewrite it instead of just tweaking it a little when the movie deal fell through.  The dialog is mind-numbing and predictable.  Every time there was a car scene I could guess what kind of conversation would be held.  "You drive too fast!"  "Are you my mother?"  Over and over and over.   ---  --- The idea was good.  A modern-day Frankenstein . . . or rather a Frankenstein that had never died and had made it to present day (yes, I know, Frankenstein was the doctor, not his monster.  But you get what I'm saying.).  But the dialog read exactly like a movie script would, or like a play.  This book had so much potential but the authors' laziness in not rewriting the entire thing after the movie wasn't made cost it dearly
I found the mitt to be too stiff to be of any real use.  You can't really pick up or handle any utensils with the mit on.  You can move hot plates, etc. but you can't really carry anything with the mitt on.  Not worth the money albeit not very expensive.
You have to repeatedly tug at this thing to get it to retract.  The wire is very thin, so I'm thinking it will not last long
a waste of my hard to come by money--- I am on a fixed income and bought this item for my 10 month old grandson for Christmas. Really a disappointment, good idea-BUT he can't even hear the animal sounds because they are so low..... If I could have taken it away from him, I definitely would have returned it for a refund!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Graphics leave something to be desired but the story and game play make this game a must play for any RPG fan.
The scent of this tea brewing is a real wake-me-up.  Cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and orange peel are some of the very redolant flavors.  The cinnamon is so strong that it gives a slight burning  feeling in the mouth--one of my favorite things about this tea.  I'm not a huge tea drinker, but I really enjoy this in winter.  It's great for mulling things as well--apples, pears, and wine.  My only complaint is that it is not 100% reliant on chopped ingredients and there are some flavors added.  But it's still incredibly good and nice for a thoughtful morning or evening.  Makes me miss Seattle, WA and Pike Place Market
My 7 year old son got it for Christmas. He was really excited. It is definitely a neat toy. The whole family was into it. However, it only lasted one day. It would no longer charge and I am just going to take it back because I am in no position waste $20.00 just for one day
Together with  'THE BEST OF KOOL&THE GANG'.....    T H I S is the ULTIMATE  bit of funk that i've found so far.  The tracks may not always have a "song structure" (and for me the women singers may be omitted..)  -  the funkiest bits in history are found here!!!!!!
This probe does NOT work with the Oregon Scientific BAR898HGA Wireless Weather Station.  You have to buy the THC268
I bought this for my boyfriend as a present. We both love the TV show and thought the game would be as exciting (without the live crowd, of course). But the game moves slow, no models - only picking case numbers. You can compete against one another, but its not really exciting.  ---  --- Maybe you should try the board game version - it can't be any worse.
I bought this switch last week. The installation was as easy as plug n play. No major problems so far. This switch is worth its price
I was already a fan of Mike and the Jacksons, But when Motown 25 came on in 83, this guy set the standard for what music and performance could be and where it could go. Till this day in my lifetime that one performance at Motown 25 is the single most perfect performance I've ever seen. I remember the next day at school and the next month after that performance we had all kind of talent shows where all of the kids were trying to out moonwalk each other. The saddest and funniest part was watching the less fortunate kids who could not afford the Michael gear wearing tube socks with dress shoes and kids making home made glitter and rhinestone gloves. Hilarious. As an adult, I refuse to let the media and even Michael himself ruin my childhood memories of this untouchable piece of music. ---  --- 24 years later Thriller remains the album to beat
I reccommend this item to anyone using disposable diapers! I had a Generic diaper throw away system It was awful! This is so easy to use once you get the hang of it. and it really keps the smell away! Try it. you'l like it
I was first introduced to the symphonic power metallers formerly known as Rhapsody (name changed due to copyright issues) on their 2006 live album Live in Canada. I have to say that I am just not that impressed or entertained by their latest studio effort. The group tends to rely more or the theatrical elements rather than focusing on their metal music. The vocals tend to be oversung, or drowned out by the chaos in the background. Rather than enhancing your metal experience with musical theatrical elements, Rhapsody of Fire puts you to sleep with them. The group does stay true to their fantasy themes however
This is a note for those of you were having trouble running this game, ---  --- This game works with XP however you need to have a combo drive that includes DVD writer/   C. D. Combo writer I have installed this game from that drive and it works perfectly
I teared when I read parts of the book, but it is such an awesome book!  I didn't want to put that book down until I was completely finished reading it.  I definetely recommend it to anyone with children.  I loved it, and I plan on keeping up with my letter box to my son
Earrings were very lightweight, hollow, and the hoops were very thin.  Not good quality, I could have done better at WalMart.  I expected a lot better from Amazon.com, especially for $50
If this man took a the time to know the history of U.S. involvment in Panama he would know that it was the U.S. that put Noriega in power in the first place.it was also the U.S. that killed the previouse leader of Panama,Omar TorriJos.Who apposed U.S. control of his county. ---  The united states has used Panama for its own gains without regard for the freedom or rights of the Panamanian people since the take over of the country by President Roosevelt in 1903. --- One of many good books about the truth of Panamanian History is by John Perkins "Confessions of an Economic Hitman"
This is a simple drawing program, much like Paint. Don't be mislead by the colored picture on the cover, it only does black and white. And it has no help in drawing Manga figures. And it is a stripped-down program, at that. The documentation is for the full program, so you can't do much of what you read in the manual and help files. Save your money, this program isn't worth buying
One whiff of this delicious soap and you are transported to a land of pine trees where plates of freshly sliced oranges are served on a bed of lemongrass, surrounded by patchouli candles. This is the best way I can describe the scent that seems to awaken from the night and mingle with memories of exotic honey and wide-open skies. I am not sure where I go when I inhale deeply, but I am no longer in the shower. Follow this with the Skin Sin lotion and you will enter a little bit of heaven on earth. Also delicious to use in a bath with sea salts and patchouli, orange slices optional, but you might crave the taste of oranges while using this soap.  ---  --- ~The Rebecca Review 
I used to sell Iman when it was in a major department store.  This stuff would fly off the shelves.  Too bad it was hardly ever in stock which made many customers go to something else.  I stuck with it for 10 years now and would not dare use anything else!  Buy it - you will not be disappointed
This is one of the best pogo sticks on the  market.you can go about 6 feet high,jump off of stairs
As others have mentioned, the front window blanks out almost immediately, and even worse, it doesn't show your missed calls.  You have to open the phone.  Stupid design.  It does not have any exterior lights, such as my old Samsung, that showed when it was charging, when charge completed, when a voice mail was waiting, etc.  This phone needs to be opened to get any info.  Can't even see the time without opening phone. ---  --- While talking on phone it blacks out after about 1 minute.  I don't like that either.  It's also very hard to hear on it.  Especially if in car, with traffic noise.  No, I'm not driving, but I'm a passenger trying to use my phone.  Forget it. ---  --- Re the color that someone mentioned.  Cingular is a light pastel pink, TMobile is magenta (dark pink).  The one thing I like is that this phone is a quad band, and if you travel interationally, it will be great.  I just got the phone, so haven't used it interational yet.  Oh, it must TMobile to get international service.   ---  --- The phone has a camera, plus other tech features, but I don't use them.  I want my phone only to be a phone, no other gadgets. ---  --- I would never buy this phone again, and as soon as I'm eligible for an upgrade this phone is history.  I doubt I would get a  Motorola ever again, I'll stick to Samsung.
This has been a great addition to my truck - a useful compass and outside thermometer without going to the expense of a navigation system (and without having to learn another techno-gadget).  My only complaint is that the display illumination could be a bit brighter.  I realize that a bright light on the dashboard could impair one's night vision, but a bit more contrast on the display would be helpful at night.
These are fantastic belts for teaching children how to swim.  They offer mobility and support and have the ability to lessen the support as time goes on.  I taught swimming for years and this is the product I'd recommend
As he did with "Parade", the soundtrack to his last vanity project "Under the Cherry Moon", Prince provides a musically invigorating soundtrack to "Graffiti Bridge", which is a hopelessly silly film. No matter. "Graffiti Bridge", Prince's first album of the 90's, is also one of Prince's best albums of the 90's. ---  --- "New Power Generation" serves as the title track to Prince's new band, and it's a powerful, funky manifesto. "The Question of U" is exotic and intoxicating. "Elephants and Flowers" is an upbeat song about spiritual redemption, whereas "Tick Tick Bang" is Prince at his most joyously raunchy. Although most of Prince's material is exceptionally strong here, the collaborations and contributions by other artists are a mixed bag. "We Can Funk" is a simmering duet between Prince and funkmaster George Clinton, and Tevin Campbell provides some youthful exuberance to "Round and Round". But the tracks by The Time mostly fall flat. I've personally always found Morris Day to be a one-trick pony with his effete pimp routine, and his one trick gets boring quickly. ---  --- It's obvious that with "Graffiti Bridge" Prince is trying to create the feel and atmosphere of a funky block party. But I can't help but wonder, without the tracks featuring other artists, if "Graffiti Bridge" wouldn't be more highly regarded as one of Prince's better albums
As a Beta user I assure you that this will make your life easier by not having to stock a lot of forms from the court
Keeps perfect time and looks great on the outdoor wall of my patio.  A classy looking clock
I purchased two chairs at first to test out the quality.  I had been looking for a Wrought Iron patio set but I didn't want to pay the high prices I was finding.  I really liked the chairs so I went ahead and ordered the WHOLE set!  2 loungers, love set, sofa, coffee table, side tables, and 2 more chairs.  Honestly, I love the set!  It's not your best quality but for the price I'm more then satisfied.  They are heavy pieces but not so heavy you can't move them around.  I had an issue with the sofa so I filled out the online return form and I'm telling you I have NEVER experienced the service I have received from Amazon.  They processed a new order at NO COST TO ME and they will pick up the defective one when they deliver the new one.  How great is that.  Even Costco makes you purchase the new item first and then they will credit you once they receive the old item back!  I order a lot online and I have to say Amazon has a great system
with plenty of opportunity to be creative.  The only downfall is that there is no way to download more cards from the internet. ---  --- All in all though, I would highly recommend this software
Great company - Terrible toy.  My daughter got this toy for Christmas and waited all day for daddy to bring home the 4 C batteries which were not included.  She was excited until we turned it on.  1) the frame is not secure and will open when you reach into the middle to change the picture disk.  2) the light is not very bright and will not work in mid-day light. 3) the image is quite small - only takes up the middle 3 inches of the paper - not even close to what is pictured on the box.  4) the clamps that hold the paper are not easy for tiny fingers to use.  5) because the small picture is in the middle of the page and the clamps are on the far edges, you can't shift the paper to re-use the paper.  You get one tiny picture in the middle of standard size piece of paper and its a waste.   ---  --- The chalk board was fine - but the whole piece slides across the table when you push to draw.  Big disappointment. ---  --- Get some washable markers and some tracing paper and don't waste your money on this suprisingly junky toy
This has to be the best of the Alien films! This film, although not as scary as the original (I mean that it did not scare me as much as Alien), it is much more exciting and enjoyable than the first. Also, this would have been an ideal conclusion to the series. Go on, buy the Collector's Edition of the first and this and enjoy
Twinings was founded in London, England in 1706, and has a long and respected tradition of producing only the finest of teas. The history of Darjeeling tea goes back to the 1840s, when Dr. Campbell, a civil engineer, planted tea seeds in his garden at Beechwood, Darjeeling. The result was a nice light tea with excellent color and aroma. Darjeeling tea gained a considerable following, and is now highly prized as the "champagne of teas!" ---  --- OK, let's get down to brass tacks - this is an excellent tea, produced by a great company, and a tea I will NEVER be without. The tea has an excellent aroma and flavor and is harder to over-steep than some other teas that I have known. Also, something of a surprise is the fact that this tea tastes at least as good iced as it does hot! As such, year round you will find me making Twinings' Darjeeling tea. ---  --- So, here's the bottom line: if you want a tea that is excellent hot AND cold, then Darjeeling is for you. If you want tea from a great tea producer, then Twinings is for you. If you want the best tea in the world, then buy Twinings' Darjeeling tea
This is a good size cot for a smallish boy scout.  It's a little small for an adult, but it fits in the tent well. The only complaint is it requires a lot of strength to set up and take apart, but it is lightweight and comfortable
our firm uses our PowerShotSD500 camera daily and often takes long videos of our work for our clients and material processing. long battery life is very important. we have over a dozen of the Canon batteries. Pleased with them all.  --- 
  This is a book meant to be enjoyed by children under the age of 10.  Young teens and adult readers will be disapointed. Wish I never wasted the time of day reading it. Glad it was borrowed from the library and not purchased or I'd demand my money back
Excellent quality and fast shipment. Will purchase from same vendor in the future
Let me start by saying I think the regular Guru energy drink is the best on the market. I only wish I could say the same about GURU Lite. There is nothing positive about this drink. It is awful! I was very excited about trying the Lite version but after my first can the rest went straight into the garbage. You might as well take a Ginseng or Ginkgo Biloba capsule open it and pour it straight into your mouth. If you are big fan of the regular Guru stay with it and don't waste your money on their Lite version.
I bought this to play back old Hi8 tapes so I could transfer them to DVD. However, there is no S-Video out and no stereo out. Video quality was bad: output was noisey and reds were over saturated. I imagine this is because there is no S-Video out. I returned it and have ordered a Sony GV-D200. Hopefully it will give me better quality since it was more than twice as much. There are some cheaper used options available, e.g. Sony EVO-250
I totally love this necklace. It goes with many things I own and really enhances a low neckline. I get compliments each time I wear it
This lens is outstanding. Speed and sharpness are top-notch. I use this lens for a wide array of situations and it has always delivered impressive results. Best lens in it's class at a reasonable price. It's well built, sturdy, and not so heavy so it's relatively easy to carry around. Canon really impressed me with this lens. I use it with my EOS system (traditional and digital cameras).
Having lived in what I consider the coffee capitol of the United States, Portland, I am confident in my personal assertion that Torrefazione Italia was the finest coffee shop out there. The environment was warm and exotic while the coffee was second to none, poured by authentic baristas. Now that these coffee shops have been closed by Starbucks I am thrilled to still be able to purchase the beans here on Amazon. Give them a try and I bet you won't go back to whatever it is that you are drinking now.
I can do this without the system, it's simple why don't you get a pair of 20 pound dumbells and put them in the ground then do pushups..trust me it works, i do it all the time and the results are nearly similar without buying ANYTHING
i bought this lip liner 3 times and i was always disappointed because no matter how hard you try to put it on your lips, it just wont glide. you will have to rub it hard on your lips to line em. clinique liners are the worst one in the market
....will be given away as a gift. I am pleased. I hope the receiver will be. --- I like the chain which I believe can worn separately or with another item
After one year of owning this scale I replaced the batteries and it stopped working
My best rating for Microsoft Money Deluxe is it is pure JUNK. Don't was your money. If it works at all, trust ,it is not with Microsoft Vista. A class action law suit sounds in order for this GARBAGE
Normally I am a big fan of the little tikes name, but not so with this product.  I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old daughter and although the concept is cute, it is not like other Little Tikes products.   To begin with, the train frequently comes off the track.  Also to activate it, you must press the button where the conductor goes.  However, it is difficult for my daughter to place the figure on this spot without it falling off.  She often presses the button in the process which activates the train while she is still trying to put the figure on it which frustrates her.  Since this is geared for toddlers, you would think that Little Tikes would have put the button to activate the motion in a different spot from where the figures go.  Also, at age 2 1/2 she is quickly bored with it.  She has more fun letting it go on the floor across the room than riding on the track.  Needless to say, it is going back.  The only good feature is that you can "pack it and go" for away from home fun
This is my first review but I just felt compelled to tell everyone about this terrific program. I bought this game when my children were in Kindergarten and second grade. Fritz and Chester's program is so engaging. There are rhymes and chants for each piece's moves as well as for some other "strategy-type" moves. For example, "A knight on the rim is ugly and dim." What a great way to teach kids to keep their knights in-play! This program teaches kids how pieces move and some simple strategies. I would recommend getting Fritz and Chester 2 now since you are going to get it after your kids learn to play! My boys both joined chess teams when they were in first and third grade. Their use of this computer game gave them the advantage to win several chess games in tournaments. Fritz and Chester 2 is also great and my boys, now in third and sixth grade, still play it
I've had one of these for 13 years.  ONE.  For THIRTEEN years.  It still works great. ---  --- PLEASE use it carefully, if you're going to use it.  You can very easily give yourself a very nasty case of some obscure (or not) repetitive stress syndrome.  To completely avoid that, and any similar problems you'll need Dr. Sonnon... but in the meantime, just be careful
My 9 year old son loves Dragon Mountain.  He wasn't able to assemble it alone; eventhough he's typically very good at assembling most other toys.  It took about an hour for him and his dad to assemble it...but he felt it was more than worth the time it took to put it together
The Big Bubbler is the greatest bubble wand----we have had consistently huge bubbles with the top-of-the-line/expensive bubble solution, as well as, the cheapest $1.99 jugs.  The only thing that didn't work at all for us was straight dish detergent (hey, we were desperate).  My youngest toddler will chase the bubbles endlessly, and even a neighbor's preteen son couldn't resist chasing the large bubbles across our yard.  I also like that I am playing WITH the kids when I make the bubbles for them vs. simply turning on a battery-operated machine and then standing back.  ---  --- If I had to gripe, it would only be to say that I wish the top of the wand (the end that holds the bubble solution) could be stood on end.  It is hard for the little ones to keep the top from spilling while waving the wand; it is also tough for them to get the wand back into the top to get more bubble solution. ---  --- We also go through a LOT of solution---I plan to buy a few large jugs of it to have it on hand.  But, this seems like a minor inconvenience given how much fun we have all had watching the bubbles dance all over our yard
I really like the Speedo suit.  I wear two swim suits, the Speedo and a larger "drag" suit over it.  I've done this since my days on the swim team.  The chlorine in the water tends to weaken the seams on my suit over time, causing the drag suit to self-destruct eventually.  Having the Speedo prevents any embarrassing moments.  The fit and material is good and it holds up very well - this is the first replacement I've needed in years.   ---  --- If you are husky, this might be a tight fit.  I wear a 42-44 pant size and this is on the snug side. 
Outstanding design. Secure, heavy duty, super easy to load, very protective of the bikes. Best possible design for older or limited users
Nothing in this book was usable for me.  Okay, very little.  If I was trying to write the next _Ethan Frome_, then this book would be perfect.  Instead I write sci-fi and fantasy.  I was looking for tips to improve my description of things; this book recommends describing different things.  Too much emphasis on metaphor (which is a wonderful tool but a tad obvious).  If you want to write in a way people might actually communicate, this book might be a waste of your time.  HOWEVER, poets and pure-literary writers might find it more useful than I did
Overall a very nice charger, though recharge times aren't even close to what is advertised.  The display is very nice as is the ability to charge individual batteries instead of having to do it in a pair.  The 900 mAH hold such a small charge that they are almost worthless.
 Any group that is so lacking in imagination that it has to steal as unusual and distinctive a song title as "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" (a 1934 hit song) deserves to be ridiculed, not rewarded with a Grammy.  ---  --- I'm just full of original ideas. I can't decide whether to write a song called "Wake Me Up Before you Go-Go" or "Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer" - or maybe "Do You Know The Way to San Jose"? 
Vincent Price at his best!!! I was amazed at his interpretation of Usher. It was very much like the hyper sensitive fellow of Poe's tale!!! The ending was shocking. I recommend this item to everybody. Good acting, very good indeed
This is not really a practical toy. My son gets discouraged, because you have to press on the keys really hard and in order to follow the music you have to be rough. It's like playing musical chairs with 5 bullies and a moving floor
Purchased this cover to protect my new Weber Q300 grill.  Fits like a glove!  Strong durable construction and superior protection.
I tested this along with the Neuros MPEG4 and must say hands down the winner in picture quality is the Neuros.  The picture with the SanDisk is very pixelated, especially with fast action sports like football and basketball.   ---  --- The SanDisk does have a better interface, and is easier to understand and set up quickly, but in the end the picture and sound quality are poor. ---  --- FYI - I'm using a PSP as my viewer
This product is excellent.  It will make it much easier on your back and also time efficient. 
This is best used when chopped into little pieces and spread copiously throughout the house.  It leaves a lovely aroma that will have your guests talking
MAN, I HATE THIS! I cannot take this any more. Watch the original and that is it. The original needs no sequel at all. Every sequel to the original sucks
Kashmir Spinach is the third Tasty Bite offering I have tried.   --- The look and taste is quite unappealing.   --- We would not consider buying it again.   --- We had high hopes based on how much we loved other Tasty Bite items we tried, but no luck with this one. ---  --- I encourage you to try Agra Peas or Jaipur Vegetables instead, two Tasty Bite items that are really fantastic
This cartridge does NOT fit my HP 648c as advertised. The color cartridge that accompanied it did, however
Item is not authentic. Kenneth Cole is all I wear and those shoes are not Kenneth Cole
Poor quality construction -- the bristles on mine started falling apart on the first use.  Plus, it was much rougher than something like loofah.  You might as well tie a couple of shoestrings on a dog brush and use that
It is a must have for all monty python and the holy grail fans!
This stuff is sooo great. This three-pack set gives you the creme de la creme in men's skincare. The shampoo is wonderful and actually prevent hair loss. The body wash is my favorite...its smells awesome. The after shave is fantastic...soothing and refreshing. I suggest this pack for those who've never used Billy Jealousy or those loyal followers such as myself...this is also a great was for someone to get introduced to Billy Jealousy, this has all the essentials. You will not be displeased, in fact you'll be in awe...you'll be compelled to tell everyone, this also makes a great gift. Billy Jealousy is the absolute best and I've used all upscale lines from department stores, Sephora, and spas...and this stuff is the best
I've always loved smoked oysters but most brands come packed in cottonseed oil, which is vile to say the least.  The Crown Prince oysters are packed in olive oil -- a huge step up in health and taste.  They are convenient little bundles of protein that can be packed in a lunch, etc.  They taste wonderful added to soup or stew.  Great for last minute entertaining.  Last but not least, I like to have a case on hand in my disaster supplies
Simply put, these are the best wiper blades I have ever used. When they wear out, I'll buy another pair regardless of their price. There is no better wiper blade on the market, period. No streaks, no skipping or sticking to the glass, and they lay flat even on the sharply-curved windshield on my '63 Galaxie. Buy them; you won't regret it, and they're a better deal than Rain-X liquid
The e-Reader is one of the best things that happened to Nintendos GBA. this is so SWEA
it has know fun.  no education.  and is a wayst of time
I ordered this bra as well as the Olga Women's Perfect Fit Full Figure, black, 38DDD.  This bra provides much better lift, support and separation than the Olga.  I think it is because the cups are seamed.  I'd recommend it to any woman who is petite in stature (I'm 5'2"), and also has a large bra size (I'm a 36DDD).
Both this game and Danger by Design were disappointing compared to some of the previous games (Shadow Ranch, the Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon, Secret of the Old Clock, etc.).  The game was short, and I thought the tasks were a bit dull.  I also found it somewhat confusing switching between Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys.  Hopefully Her Interactive will produce something better next time, because these games really are addictive, even for adults
Juggernaut was more or less lumped in with the disaster movie genre when it came out in the mid-70s, possibly because the making of the film itself seemed so disastrous. Originally a Bryan Forbes film, Forbes was briefly replaced by Don Medford (who had also briefly taken over The Guns of Navarone after Alexander MacKendrick was fired and before J. Lee Thompson was hired) before Richard Lester took over. While it's easy to spot some of the typical Lester touches (such as poor offscreen jokes added during the dubbing sessions), it's so unlike most of his other films that you constantly find yourself wondering who directed what. ---  --- Regardless of where the credit lies, the end result is a terrific thriller, with Richard Harris' bomb disposal team parachuted to Omar Sharif's liner with several bombs aboard while Anthony Hopkins tries to track down the extortionist in London. The bomb disposal scenes are genuinely tense, the characterisation surprisingly strong enough to undercut potential clich?s and Alan Plater's dialog quite superb, with the film offering both the required suspense and a neat little state-of-the-nation address of Britain in the early 70s. Really rather terrific.
There's a reason the price on this is low ... because it's a worthless piece of merchandise.  I gave mine to good will two days after it came.
Used this for Double stroller while on vacation in Hershey Park -fantastic!  Easy to put on - easy to store!  I don't know why strollers - especially doubles - have such dinky canopies anyway!   But this did it's duty
Now, I'm a pretty picky guy when it comes to certain things in life and one of those items just happens to be Backpacks. I spent about two months searching for a new one until I finally came across this particular model. I'll start with by saying that I love this damn thing. It has plenty of space, a whole bunch of extra cords that I suppose a hiker would use but I think just look nice, and its very durable (which is a must for me since everything I own will take a beating). I'm telling you straight from the horse's mouth, this Backpack is worth the money. Now if it only came as an 18 slot..
Since the storylines of this fourteen-year-old film must surely be well-known, let me say that The Piano, one of my favorite movies, is a unique production whose makers went out of their way to truly give it the appearance of the mid-nineteenth-century. It strolls forward with an anti-modern slowness in order to accentuate the unspoiled scenery of New Zealand, and successfully bring certain moments to prominence with a pace that matches that of the pre-electronic era in which it is set. The quality of the visuals is heightened by the performances given by Holly Hunter, Sam Neill, Harvey Keitel, and most especially Anna Paquin, whose skillful portrayal here won her an Oscar at the tender age of eleven. The plot of The Piano is highly unusual, even unique. For filmmakers to have accomplished the release of a tale concerning a woman of the 1800's, who went from Scotland to the most remote of British colonies in order to marry a stranger, for this woman to be one whose self-imposed muteness is compensated by her lovely playing of a piano...I'm daunted by the courage of those who brought The Piano into reality. For the wealth of feeling in its story, for its setting, for its cast and for its sheer brave inimitability, it is a fine motion picture
The shade I use is Subtle Lips. I love it! It gives some color but not so much that I feel done up. I could be in complete casual clothes and throw it on and feel great. And yet it looks great on Sundays too. Because of the mild color it matches everthing. And unlike lip gloss, it's not sticky at all. (I can't tolerate any stickiness!) I am only somewhat picky about scent and taste, and to me this one has neither. I think it is by far worth the $20!!
Tina Dirmann did a fantastic job writing about this difficult case, which encompasses motherhood, mental illness, child abuse, and matricide. Dirmann does not interject her own biases or agenda into her writing, rather she presents the many different angles of this story in a compassionate fashion. That, in and of itself is impressive, because many writers of true crime tend to lean one side or the other,get caught up in emotion, and appear unable to really present all sides of the story. Lessons can be learned from this book regarding mental illness and society's responsibility to help families who are in need of intervention. It is so sad that the extended families of these boys failed not only them, but also tragically failed their mother.
This book disappointed me after reading Martins letters. Although this book provides a very different angle on value investing and has some useful ideas the writing style is poor and lacks clarity. There are much better books on analysing companies I suggest Financial Statement Analysis by Martin Fridson and Fernando Alvarez.
I installed this cover and took pictures from various distance and angel. I could read all numbers clearly.  They claim that it will work with actual traffic camera. I have no way to test that
Whereas the body glove cosmetically looks good, it has a diabolical flaw inherent in its POOR design. The attachment button that is mounted on the rear of the glove that allows quick engagement and disengagement to the belt clip is seriously defective. The plastic button resides in a small pocket sewn into the rear of the glove. The problem is that the button flange that holds the button connector to the glove is floating inside of the rubber elastic glove. The pocket stretches! As soon as any pressure is applied to the phone when it is hanging on your belt (like when you sit down or bump anything), the connector easily (and silently) dislodges from its elastic pocket!!! Your valuable cell phone drops to the ground and you have lost it! You have lost your phone but the button is still attached to your belt clip. This is a dreadfully constructed device that the designer should be ashamed of. Use this glove at your own peril
I was looking for a cd that I could listen to all of the time.  Oh my God, I am breathless.  I was brought to tears as they sang "Mama".  My mother passed away in 2002 and I never got a chance to say thank you and this song said it all.  All of Il Divo's songs have touched me in a way that no one else could.  Thank you for touching my heart.  I really recommend that you give this cd a chance.  All of these other people on the board that gave it a low score, obviously need a hearing aid and a heart.  Blessing
This is the first time I bought a guitar tuner online and it works great. Love it
Think twice before purchase: --- 1. Most of the good tracks are available on the non-copy protected "All-Time Top 100 TV Themes", along with the best themes from other networks. --- 2. This disc has CDS-100 copy protection, so you probably can't upload to Windows Media and definitely not to iTunes. --- I could not upload from my internal CD drive, only from an external multi-format CD/DVD burner. It still only uploaded to Windows Media, not iTunes. --- To get into iTunes, I had to add the WMA files and then convert them to MP3. --- This probably caused some quality loss as I'm converting one compressed format to another compressed format! --- A time-consuming and tedious process which could have been avoided altogether if music companies would get over this fixation on "controlling" everything. --- Hello record execs: If nobody can add your discs to their libraries, guess what happens? They DON'T PLAY YOUR MUSIC!!! --- You might think you're protecting your valuable investment, but you're shooting yourself in the foot instead. Here's how it goes: --- 1. Nobody can upload your music. --- 2. Nobody plays your music. --- 3. Nobody hears your music. --- 4. Nobody recommends your music. --- 5. Nobody buys your music. --- Remember, this only loaded from a particular kind of drive, so it may or may not work on yours. --- As Bela Lugosi would say: Bevare
i bought this stuff trying to save a few bucks b/c it claims to be better than proactiv. after using proactiv for a month, then trying this stuff, acnefree doesn't compare to proactiv. granted, this is better than a bar of soap, but it's definately worth spending the extra $20 to get proactiv.
They went over well in our house.  THe sugar content is semi-low, and the peanut butter has good protein
This cookbook is the best in my collection - and I have a lot!! The instructions are clear and the pictures are great
This is my first experience with HDTV and wide screen.  This 46" Sony TV is excellent with HD programs; with regular broadcasts, it is a bit muddy, but that is the fault of the signal, not the TV.  I am very pleased with the overall quality of the set.  I had the set professionally installed and set up, and I am sure glad I did: install and set up are not for amateurs like me; if anything ever happens, I will be hard pressed to reset things.  Sony's instruction manuals are not that great
I've only had this watch for about a week, so can't really comment about the long term durability.  However, it is ultra cool watch. ---  --- Although I've not got a scale handy at the moment, but it seems to be lighter than my iPod Nano.  Really a featherweight watch, and therefore very comfortable to wear.   ---  --- The dial color really can't be adaquately captured in a picture.  It is VERY attractive, much more striking than the image indicates.  Several people have asked where I purchased it. ---  --- I'm very happy with this choice
Quite frankly this is the only cooking magazine I have ever subscribed to that I actually have looked forward to using and to receiving every two months. I like it so much I am writing my first Amazon review! The format of the magazine makes it easy to follow the recipes - they are always printed on two pages across from each other - and unlike some of the other posters I prefer the black and white format so that the paper is thicker and doesn't tear easily. Having tear away ads (for their own products) on the outside of the magazine means that the usable portion doesn't take up much space on my shelf.  ---  --- The recipes are easy to follow and usually clear. When they include specialized ingredients there is usually also a substitution listed. Their product reviews are terrific - I wish I hadn't wasted so many dinners on bad whole wheat pasta. My only gripe, as someone who does not have a dishwasher, is the great number of bowls and kitchen tools the recipes require. ---  --- I have made at least half the recipes from the magazines, many several times, which is no small feat for a "flexitarian" who never has meat as a main dish.
If rating a "no star" was possible, that's what it really deserves.  I bought this for my two year old twin boys and as I was inflating it - with a handpump - it blew at the seams!  Beyond patching!  Unfortunately they never even knew that they had it.  I would not buy it again because of the quality of the product.  How can kids be safe jumping on something that blows out when being pumped by a hand pump???  That's like blowing it up by mouth! 
It does the job; I haven't had it long enough to attest to its durability.  Too bad the shipping cost more than the product
I have all her other cds I especially love Unsung Heroes there is a vibe to that cd that gets u right in but with this one its like shes just tryin far toooo hard to be good....Sure the technique is spot on but THERE IS NO SOUL the emotion is missing...for me I like my jazz vocals with feeling. I like the singer to take u on a journey deep into to the song. u wont get that here all u will get is technique..
Isiklandirmanin iyi olmadigi yerlerde netlik sorunu oluyor. Birde floresan isik altinda beyaz dengesi tam tutmuyor. Diger ozellikleri gayet guzel. Bellek kartina cekim yapabiliyor olmasi cok guzel
I purchased this bike from a local dealer 15 months ago and it has broken down 3 times in the last 15 months. The resistence motor is defective which is what I have had replaced 3 times now. This motor does not allow you to change gears or bike through a program--upgrading to shifiting on the fly technology would be a plus.  --- The positive aspect of the bike is the comfort and grip heart rate monitor and the ability to swap out saddles also a plus. Ovewrall I cannot recommend this product.
We are using this series of CDs in our homeschool music program - they are fantastic!   We especially love this one about Bach - what an awesome man!   The story of his life is told in a way that is very interesting and holds the children's attention while also using various pieces of his music in the narration.  It is done VERY well!   My children are gaining a tremendous amount of knowlege and appreciation for music through this CD and so are my husband and I
After receiving, putting together and using this toy with myself and children, I overestimated what it would be.  I remember the old school Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots, and this product isn't even close.  The old characters stood 6-8" tall and both necks sprung up with metal parts when a blow to the head was delivered.  This version has only plastic parts, the characters are 4" tall at best, and the 'win' is from a blow to the chest, not the head.  Metallo's head springs up, but Superman's head only nods backward.  It is difficult to discern the 'winner' from the set up.  It was only an $11 lesson for me to learn, but if you truly want a real Rock 'em set, try eBay, or yard sales.  This replica is not comparable to the original
the willie dixon chess set is a window into the early blues --- that was the basis for some of the most well known rock and --- roll songs of all time. from led zeppelin to the kinks willie dixon and his music was a source of inspiration and musical reinvention. sometimes you have to stay true to your roots. its --- an incredible journey into the heart of original blues
A great add-on for the Xacti HD1, but two minor problems I've found so far. 1. I can't use a circular polarizing filter with the wide angle lens as it cuts off the corners of a picture and; 2. flash photography won't work as the  pop-up flash becomes obscured by the barrel of the add-on lens
I lived in Seattle for almost 20 years.  However, in all that time, and even going down to the Pike Place Market at least 2 or 3 times a year (we lived far east of town), I never "knowingly" drank MarketSpice Tea.  However, we moved to North Carolina and "discovered" this wonderful drink.  We also became avid tea drinkers.  A good part of that conversion, was due to MarketSpice Tea. ---  --- The flavors are spicey, pungent, smack you up side the head intense.  If you like Lipton, you won't like this.  We use the loose tea only.  Yes, it's a little more of a hassle compared to tea bags, but worth it due to the freshness, flavor, etc. ---  --- Also, until the our last purchase, which was from Amazon, we always ordered from MarketSpice themselves.  They're great people, they always shipped what I wanted, etc.  I'll never buy from them directly again.  They don't want to move into the 21st Century when it concerns automation and I respect that.  However, I have.  Amazon gives me the capability to do both; order my favorite tea and do so online, with a company that remembers my address, credit card, etc. ---  --- I can wholeheartdly recommend this product and ordering through Amazon.  If you like tea, you owe it to yourself to try this product.
Like the idea of getting some samples, but once you refrig these it is tough to get the sauce out of the small bottles.   Do not buy.
As a frequent reader of home design books and magazines, the title and the beautiful cover of this book immediately appealed to me.  A quick review of the table of contents revealed that I had to have this book.  Pelosi begins with the basics, moves into specifics, and then focuses on those special challenges we all face when trying to make our homes beautiful and appealing without spending a fortune. The pictures are gorgeous and inspiring and the author has an ability to write clearly and concisely with a great sense of humor. Whether you are looking for a single design solution or, like me, enjoy reading about interior design, this is the book for you...and it makes a great gift for your friends and family and colleagues and anyone who lives in a home.  "Interior Divine" made my holiday shopping easier this year!
I have been a Barry Manilow fan since I was a teenager.  I have NEVER been disappointed with any of his work and this CD is no exception!  He is such a brilliant arranger and the remix of these classics is fabulous!  His voice is as good as ever!  Even my 7 year old begs to listen to the CD everytime we get in the car and she can sing all the words! 
This watch is beautiful.  I cannot say enough good things about this watchs design.  Its 45mm face is bigger than most watches but doesnt look gawdy, it keeps perfect time and is very light weight.  I bought the Calibre 8700 before this one and I love both of them but I would give this one a slight edge.  My two small complaints are that this watch doesnt have the perpetual calender which is a very nice feature that the Calibre 8700 does have, and also that this watch uses mineral crystal for the face and not Saphire.  I am sure the crystal used is scratch resistant but it is no where near as resistant as Saphire crystal would be
The umbrella was quite a score through amazon - including the shipping & handling.  It was still cheaper than Walmart!  lol......additionally, it is of great quality.  We utilize this umbrella for our bistro table and our porch now is all green.  It is sturdy and even withstood being blow over with Tropical Storm Tammy!  Twice
Actually haven't heard this CD, yet, I can still comment on part of it. I was the lucky guy who did the live recording at the X-Ray Cafe.   Sold the masters to the band a couple years ago and just now got around to thinking, "I wonder if they ever did anything with those masters?" ---  --- So, I was there at the show and can say that every ounce of energy that the band put out (which was considerable since this was the last show on their tour,  but they knew the X-Ray was special and gave it their all)- It was all captured on these recordings.   ---  --- The machine was a Tascam 688 that used standard cassette tapes for 8-channel recordings. Most all the mics were either Shure SM57/58, but there was also a high quality Shure stereo mic overhead that was mainly used for capturing the drum kit but also provided a nice stereo image of the stage.   ---  --- The X-Ray was perfect for this type of recording. The tiny PA was only used for the vocals, so, there was no competing with a PA blasting everything.  I would place a SM-57 close to every amp.  Had a nice specialtiy bass mic, too.  Usually, 8 channels was enough to catch everything, but, there were extra inputs where it was possible to stack multiple mics onto a single track if needed. Because of the overhead stereo catching the drums, this was rarely needed. ---  --- With a full house, such as the night with The Gits, any reflecting waves were just soaked up by the body mass of the crowd, creating what turned out to be a very nice intimate recording space.  There was split box on stage which fed all the mics to the X-Ray "business office" next door, which is where the Tascam was setup away from any real danger.  All of which made it a fun gig to record in comfort and be able to also go over to the stage side and enjoy the show.  Every once in a while, magic happened. --- D. Fletcher --- Portland, OR
They look nice, but they're badly put together; I had to re-sew all of the fingers within the first month
i hate to write a bad review- i think it's actually the first one i've ever written. this was a gift from my husband's work christmas party for our 2-year old. the extension on the pole is a stiff plastic piece and doesn't stay extended so that you can catch the fish; it folds back on itself. so our son wasn't able to catch anything with it. it would be better if the extension didn't bend at all, but just stayed in one place, and even if it did that i wouldn't buy it. it's more fun to have a pole with a string so you can reel it in
I own a more expensive Braun but bought this model as a gift for someone who I wasn't sure if he would use an electic toothbrush. After 7 months, the toothbrush won't turn off-something is shorted out. Unfortunately I no longer have the receipt. My more expensive model which I use multiple times a day has been problem free for over five years
This boonie hat is collapsible, yet has a firm rim. Chin-strap is attached to keep it where it belongs in high winds. This is the hat that will conceal you in the woods, but gets noticed about town. The digital pattern is impressive can often times is a conversation piece. I wear it almost every day, and it's my favorite piece of headgear
This is a very capable program that has too many nuances. For just a simple DVD burn it is far to complex. Definitely for the advanced user, I am sorry that I spent the money
This is a very neat hammock. It is very comfortable and easy to get in and out of. It does of course not allow air to flow through like a rope hammock, but is so much more comfortable. I also bought the matching pillow and really enjoy the lazy summer evenings now. I roll mine up and bring it inside when I'm not using it, which is quick and easy to do and will make it last that much longer. It will hold to adults, but is a little crowded
Uncomfortable and heavy for bar ends and useless as mirrors. As mentioned, the mirrors are of a terrible quality. To top that, they do not stay in place when adjusted
I read the various reviews about the movie "The Hunter".  I was surprised at the extremeties in preference.  Much like owning a Fiero,  . . . . which I do. ---  --- The movie, as is the Fiero, is overall slower than most of McQueen's.  However, he still pulls it off, showing his great acting ability.  When you take the character, "Papa" Thorson,  he was a different breed in the wrong time era.  Who else, but McQueen could make him so realistic? ---  --- I haven't seen the movie in several years. I have been wanting a copy to add to my library.  I intend to do that today. ---  --- Oh yeah, the relationship between the movie and the Fiero?  I have found that there are those that either dearly love it or wish they had never laid eyes on it.  I loved "The Hunter" and I love my Fiero.  For those of you who don't understand, . . . "sorry"!  Steve McQuen displayed more of his talent, even while ill.   God bless you, Steve and thank you for the entertainment you gave us
this magazine is the best one out there. if your a hardcore ps2 gamer, get this for a year or two. ive gotten this since it was still psone magazine and i have never seen one bad issue. they give you reviews that are %97.9 of the time helpful. you know the're serious 'cause they write down entire levels! PLUS THEY GOT SWIMSUIT ISSUES! a must for the gamer. --- -XESX
I agree with other reviewers that the graphics and vocals are good, but I find the gameplay itself less than stellar. For starters, I've always been irritated with games that don't let you save your status whenever you want. Sometimes I just want to get in a quick dose of gameplay, but that's not possible with these games that require you to play through an entire section before being allowed to save.  That contributes to the repetitive, tedious nature of some sections. If you get stuck getting through a certain bit of the game, you're doomed to replay much of what led up to it over and over again. ---  --- I realize that tricky camera angles are some of the challenges that are supposed to exist in this game. More than in the earlier versions, however, I have trouble getting myself lined up for whatever task. Another tedious element. ---  --- I found this game to be more a test of my endurance and patience than actual fun
This diaper bag is a great urban carrier for baby items and can easily pass off as a regular messenger bag for every day use.  ---  --- * It's functional and has multiple organizers, including a place for your cell phone, keys, and a zippered insulated compartment for baby's bottle or a toddler's drink. ---  --- * For parents, there are two inside pockets with zippers that are perfect for wallets and other small items. The interior has easy stash pockets for storing diapers, wipes, and other baby essentials.  ---  --- * Overall, it's a stylish looking bag that moms or dads could use. The design is trendy without having an appearance that will become easily outdated. ---  --- * After nearly two years of daily use, it's still in good condition and shows little signs of wear.  ---  --- * It's also a very convenient on-the-go type bag that stays put when you're out and about
As a library administrator I get to see and read an awful lot of woodworking books and magazines.  I have been a personal subscriber to Woodworker's Journal for a year now, and an off and on reader of the magazine for about 5 years.  In that time I have grown to appreciate this as a very good woodworking magazine.  Is it my favorite?  No, but I still like it well enough to recommend it to others.  I also regularly read Fine Woodworking, Workbench, Wood, Popular Woodworking, etc. and like all of those, this magazine has its strengths.  I find that WJ is very into power tools, tool reviews (theirs are among my favorites), and shop projects.  Having said all of that, I also must confess that the best piece of furniture I ever built came from a plan in WJ magazine (an arts & crafts style wine storage table), so don't pigeon-hole it too much. ---  --- Try it for a year and I bet you won't be sorry! ---  ---     
This is the best gluten free item I have found so far.  This mix makes the best tasting waffles and pancakes, with a great texture - even non-Celiac friends and family like to eat these. Thank you Pamela for making gluten free food taste good
my son loves this jumper.  it gives him a sense of independence.  he likes to rock from one leg to the other and then he spins completely around
I've been frustrated for quite some time now with having Adobe Reader and expecting it should do what Adobe Acrobat can do.  I was especially interested in creating PDF's (Portable Document Formats)of Word documents.  Although I have Photoshop that can do this for me in a roundabout way, I wasn't satisfied with the extra time it took to do so.  Faced with the assignment of pulling together a rather large family cookbook, aptly named, "Death by Cholesterol", I felt justified in finally purchasing not only "Acrobat" but also "OmniPage", an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software.  With these programs in hand it made the project fun to do.  Now I have the whole cookbook with its index as a sinle multi-page PDF file that can be read and also printed out by anyone I care to send it to over the Internet.  It's of great value to me now and gives me enhanced versatility even though I've only used a small part of its capabilities.  The reason that I've only given it a "4" rating?  I'm upset that I didn't get the full version, but I can't justify doing so.  I'm being petulant
The housing worked great. Took it to 80ft scuba diving and with the flash on the colors came out ok. No leaks and access to all functions a plus.
This is the book many others attempt to duplicate but simply cannot. In addition to the cool little features like elastic band (keeps book closed when stuffed full of other found items & papers), the pocket in the back and the durable cover this is a very well made book. As a student of book making, this is a classic piece. Most books nowadays are a form of "perfect binding" where the pages are just glued on the spine. Needless to say this is as non-archival and non-durable as it gets. Moleskine's are done they classic way: pages folded and sewn together in signatures then sewn to the binding. They will last forever, which is why we still have sketchbooks around from the likes of Van Gogh, etc. ---  --- An overall great choice, I recommend it constantly
My daugher loves this one
Not that I know everything about crime - especially getting away with it - but A SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM made it look too easy. Performances by Michael Caine as a done-wrong-now-doin'-wrong angry executive and Will Patton as  the police detective who is wise to him make the film worth a look on  television.  But A SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM needed to close a few holes in its  story to make it worthy of your movie theater/home video payment
I subscribed to Cooks Magazine some years ago, back when it  began publishing again.  I had problems with issues that failed to arrive, and wrote to them about it - never received a reply or any note of concern. ---  --- Since that time, I occasionally glance through it at newsstands to see if there are any articles of interest.  Even by dint of casual glance, I've begun to tire of the formulaic articles in which some drone tirelessly adds or deletes ingredients in order to finally come up with the "perfect recipe" for something or other.  I now skip right to the "perfected" recipe, and decide whether its worth committing to memory.  Some of the explanations for the success or lack thereof of the inclusion or exclusion of a particular ingredient are hare-brained at best. ---  --- There are also two other areas of this magazine that have disappointed me: ---  --- 1.  Product Reviews:  They range from just plain wrong to idiotic. ---  --- The KitchenAid Pro 600 was hailed by Cook's as the best in its class for many mixing chores.  Yet, the Amazon reviews tell a different tale - one of a short lifespan when used to mix bread dough because of a plastic gear cover that deforms and finally comes apart, allowing the metal gears to separate. ---  --- Christopher Kimball (the editor) once performed an evaluation of cookware in which he calculated the price of the cookware per pound of its weight.  No, I'm not joking.  In that evaluation, Le Creuset came out on top simply because it was heavy.  All-Clad, even though it conducts heat very evenly, suffered for not having as much heft, and therefore was judged pricey, on a pound weight basis. ---  --- One issue of Cooks boasted on its cover "Unsweetened chocolate -supermarket brand beats others".  Apparently, Hershey's was designated best.  Not too many months later, Callebaut was recommended above all others, and Hershey's was judged barely acceptable.  Feeling manipulated yet? ---  --- 2.  Finally, there are those dreadful editorials by Mr. Kimball.  Rambling, painfully written, and punctuated with a picture of Mr. Kimball wearing a bow tie, and looking very much as if his head were being held on by it. Mr. Kimball is a humble man, with much to be humble about.  He writes as if he were chanelling Helen Gurley Brown, but in red and black flannel watch-plaid and without her sense of play.   ---  --- Time to re-vamp this magazine, folks
I typically do not read stories like this, but a neighbor had lent it to me and I figured I'd check it out.  The plot isn't bad, but the dialogue is another story.  The writing was so unbelievably awful that I had to fight myself to finish it.  Phrases like "God damn, Oh god, etc..." were repeated over and over again. I got really sick hearing about Tess's cute freckles and Jimmy's movie star looks/sex drive.  The majority of the story line between Tess and Jimmy has them arguing over a one night stand.  It was 300 + pages of pretty bad writing.  I'd strongly recommend taking a pass on this book. Not worth your time unless you are looking to take a mini-break from Harlequin romances...
This game I would recommend without reservation to anyone looking for an adventure game that is beautiful, positive, entrancing, funny, inventive, has a great soundtrack, and doesn't involve violence / carnage.  I'm 40 and was completely under the spell of the game for weeks and weeks.  My 6 year old son was equally engaged, and was able to complete about 40% of it without help, himself (he needed help with boss battles, or anything under time pressure). ---  --- You can lose hours to this game but you won't emerge with tense, sore shoulders from anxiety or frustration over impossible tasks.  At the same time, it is definately not too easy.  It's just challenging enough.  And it's long thank goodness, because I didn't want it to end!  The overall tone is so positive.  You get to be a Japanese wolf goddess romping through what is a detailed, beautifully imagined and executed Japanese watercolor world.  You have weapons and you do take out monsters, but your weapon is a ink brush, and you take out the monsters with calligraphy strokes.   ---  --- Simply brilliant, and would make an excellent Christmas gift for an adventure game lover
I am originally from Germany and enjoyed your magazine over there. So glad to have finally found it here and again can enjoy your needlework patterns, iron-on transfers and knit fashions. Your directions are clear and easy to follow. ---  --- Thank you for a wonderful magazine! ---  --- Gerda
You can go wrong, very good equiment, lots of fun easy to carry, the console with most games plus has a great pric
pictures do not come out very good. poor quality! i would not recommend it
Let's see. You need two different batteries AND two different sized screwdrivers. So after buying the 9V for the remote control and searching for a long enough screwdriver to open the bus to put in the double As... I turned it on.  ---  --- *HONK!*HONK!* ---  --- It's loud. Really loud. Ugh
This is the best perfume that I have ever used.  I tried Estee Lauder, Lancome, and I always come back to Paloma.  The scent is wonderful and it stays on your clothes for a long time.  BUY IT TODAY
Normally I wouldnt write a review, but I have had numerous experiences with this camera that I thought I would share. ---  --- My sister first bought the camera, and I was amazed with how user friendly it was and I thought the pictures turned out pretty well.  Shortly afterward, her screen blacked out, without any great impact or weather damage. ---  --- Naturally, I assumed it mustve gotten bumped in the wrong way, tough luck.  I then proceeded to buy one for myself, and a couple of months after I had it, my screen also inexplicably failed to work. ---  --- And then for Christmas, my sister received a replacement camera for her broken one, and yet again, shortly after purchase, the screen was broken. ---  --- I do accept some responsibility for the damage, I imagine that if it was in a purse in a bookbag, perhaps it got rattled around a bit.  But three times? I dont find this to be a coincidence, and I do not reccomend that you risk your money, because you too may have to replace it after 3 months
My only reservation is that I had no choice on the specific type of basil plants I receive.  Some of the ones in the kit are not ones I am interested in
After subscribing to Natural Health for years, the magazine recently "went to the dogs". I now subscribe to Alternative Medicine instead and it is like Natural Health USED to be. I love it. The information is accurate and the topics are all very interesting
There was a time when liberalism had a connotation of deep thinking, tolerance, and openness to healthy, civil debate. ---  --- No longer.  And HARPER'S is a perfect symbol for all that ails the Left.  To call this magazine "Left leaning" is a farce.  It doesn't lean...it completely, totally, enthusiastically, and blindly tumbles and falls into the "Far Left" swamp.  The tone is often hysterically and shrilly partisan, reflecting the ongoing deafness and disconnection that the leftist media elites have towards the mainstream of America.   ---  --- The quality of the writing and feature selection has declined precipitously through recent years.  This rag is about as credible now as THE GUARDIAN, NATIONAL ENQUIRER, or, come to think of it, The New York TIMES!  Save your money, LOL!
This is not your tipical music mag with all the coorporate mainstream bull.  This mag turns you on to what is up and coming in the music world and is a great tool for finding new music.  I recomend it to everyone that enjoys good music
Purchased this tricycle for my grandson - 3rd birthday - a huge success!!!!  Not only was it reasonably priced, it came w/free shipping - great deal
I've been using PrintMaster for years to create greeting cards, party invitations, banners and posters for my kids' school. This version has a lot of great new art and images and my son has even made personalized cover for his iPod. I'd reccomend it to anyone who likes PrintMaster or wants to create great-looking projects at home
I have been a reader of BusinessWeek for over 10 years.  I have noticed that it has had a significant change in focus over the last year.  While there are more articles on "Personal Business", the hard-core articles have gone the way of Newsweek, and U.S. News and World reports.  The nature of the articles are lightweight and do not reflect issues important to decision makers today. ---  --- Like many others, I have noticed a political slant or agenda over the last year.  Specifically, their commentaries and economic analysis trend to the left.  Bob Kuttner is co-editor of the American Prospect and contributor to the Boston Globe.  Every one of his articles begins with the premise that the President's policies are bad and then is followed by a tortuous rational for that thesis, to include discussion of the days of gold backed currency. ---  --- Andrea D'Andrea Tyson is better, but as a former Clinton advisor, is not objective in her analysis.  Alternative economic opinions are far and few between and what opinions they do tout, does not agree with the numbers stated in their own Figures of the Week. ---  --- While BW has the potential for great reporting based on their resources, they have let their editorial priorities get in the way of serious business reporting.  For serious Business readers and students, I recommend going to alternative sources. ---  --- And yes, I will let my subscription lapse this year.
I tried Fisher-Price's Take-Along Jungle Swing then this Open Travel Swing. In both swings my baby would lean forward and fold himself in half in the seat. The Jungle swing was difficult to haul around since it didn't stay closed well and the "palm tree" was always in the way. Finally I bought the Fisher-Price Aquarium Swing. I found the seat of the Aquarium swing to be deeper and it clicks in place (so it won't fold over on baby) and it is easier to assemble and haul around.
The Samsung A900 is a great phone - a Motorola Razr on steroids. (That is, it's much more durable than the Razr.)  ---  --- BUT THE BATTERY LIFE IS AWFUL!!!  You literally have to charge this phone at least two times per day to get any real talk time. ---  --- NOT ANY MORE!  The Bargaincell price was so low, I was skeptical.   PERISH THE THOUGHT!  I got the battery on time; it was VERY well packaged.  It fit the phone PERFECTLY, as did the COVER it came with. ---  --- I plugged it in and let it charge completely.  I then used the phone for THREE DAYS without a recharge!  WHOO HOO!!!!  BRAVO BARGAINCELL! ---  --- BY THE WAY - Even though this is a somewhat "thick" battery, it is  SURPRISINGLY UNOBTRUSIVE: It does NOT add the "bulk" you might think, looking at its picture.  In fact, I think the phone actually looks BETTER with the larger battery.  I have a leather Bytech carry case designed for the Razr/A900.  It's a tight fit now, but I'm sure the case will stretch much like a new shoe does after it's been worn a few days. ---  --- DO NOT HESITATE TO BUY ONE OF THESE BATTERIES!!
I love this cereal. It is the greatest and looks like Amazon offers the best price. I like to add frozen wild blueberries to it with milk. YUM
Great enginering, design and craftmanship; works great every day; but I had to throw away a travel size "Waterpick" after 18 months, because it is impossible to obtain a replacement hose assembly from the manufacturer or anywhere else. It doesn't make any sense to supply an irreplaceable disposable part, on an equipment designed to outlast it three times
I didn't encounter any problems with this product infact it was much easier to use and it allows you to combine and orginaze text files, chart spreadsheets, drawings, PDF documents and more into a single compressed package with advanced security features it also has many tools, overall this product was fantastic and I cannot recommend this highly enough. The interface and toolbars might be annoying but that is just a slight problem since it can be taken down and become more user friendly. The other reviewers who complained about this being slower need to know that this is just the standard edition which I use, there is a better edition which is The Professional Full Product of Adobe Acrobat 7.0 that also includes an upgrade.....
A very intense book on print making. A must have book for serious artists, who want to expand in their field. Lots and lots of contacts in back of book maiking it easy to find anyone you need for print making! A
This is an awesome movie! I think its better than Anchors Aweigh. Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra are two baseball players named Eddie O'Brien and Dennis Ryan who play for the Wolves. During the off-season Eddie and Dennis are vaudeville stars. When they return for the baseball season the whole team is horrifed to hear that the new owner K.C. Higgins wants to take an active part in coaching. As it turns out the K in K.C. Higgins happens to stand for Katherine (Esther Williams) so the new owner is a woman. Katherine dosn't fall for womanizer Eddie so the two don't get along at all!! Dennis does fall for her though, but Katherine isn't in love with him. Shirley Delwyn (Betty Garrett) has her eyes on Dennis and she won't give up on him! Also in the cast is Jules Munshin who plays Nat Goldberg, Dennis and Eddie's baseball pal.  ---  --- This movie has a lot of great music. --- The songs include "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" Frank and Gene sing this song as their vaudeville act. Also Williams sings this while swimming in the pool.  --- "Yes, Indeedy" The boys sing this song to the baseball team when they return from their vaudeville act. Its about their love life. --- "O'Brien to Ryan to Goldberg" Kelly, Sinatra, and Munshin sing this song! One of the best numbers! --- "The Right Girl for Me" Sinatra sings this song to Williams. --- "It's Fate, Baby"  Garrett sings this to Sinatra to prove that they were meant for each other.  --- "Strictly USA" Probabley the best number everyone sings this at a party. --- "Upon St. Patrick's Day" Kelly dances and sings to this great song. He sorta does this Irish gig. Kelly is truly the best dancer there ever was! This is one of the best numbers up there w/ Strictly USA. --- At the end Kelly, Sinatra, Williams, Garrett sing to Strictly USA as the finale. It really great! The dvd has the following special features which are 2 deleted numbers called "Baby Face" and "Boys and Girls Like You and Me". It also contains the trailers of Anchors Aweigh, On the Town, and the trailer for this movie. Also includes notes on Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly. For some odd reason I love this movie! This is a must see if you are a Kelly fan
My first blackberry and I love it! I wanted to stop lugging around a phone AND a rather heavy Dell Axim just to have contacts, calendar and task-to-do list. I wanted a phone that synched with Outlook and was a great phone.  The Pearl is definitely the BEST choice.  I didn't really care about internet, music or camera, but the cheapest $30 internet plan from Cingular lets me have unlmited internet and access to home email instantly - it's just great!  I bought the $40 1Gb card and now have about 150 mp3 songs and pictures on it.  I use the mp3 songs as ringtones and it's GREAT to be able to instantly recognize who's calling from the music.  Camera is ok - not great, but ok and very nice to have for on-the-spot photos that you don't want to lug around the regular digital for.  I actually emailed a picture on the spot - very cool.  Battery life is phenomenal so far.  However, I'm not a heavy user and I used the profiles to have phone automatically shut off from 2am to 6am every day.  ---  --- Only cons so far are: 1) getting used to the keypad - believe what every one says about the intuitiveness of the keypad figuring out the correct word.  I've followed other folks' advice and don't really look at the words letter by letter - i type a sentence and then look - it works like a charm 9 times out of 10 that the keyboard correctly identifies each word.  Still, this type of entry is so different for a first time blackberry user, but getting used to this is still better than using a stylus and touch screen like the Axim. --- 2) Also having trouble with having to restart if I change a ringtone for someone - I have to reseat the battery to get the change to take effect.  Hmmm... --- 3) Volume when talking, even on speakerphone, is average - not terrible, but ok.  So far, my reception is fine. --- 4) I also wonder how long the track ball will last - I'm not a heavy user and I still use it constantly.  I think i'm going to buy the insurance plan just in case. ---  --- These minor cons are far outweighed by a simply GREAT phone that synchs with Outlook and so very much more.  Bye Bye Dell Axim.  It's true what some say - I'm a "crackberry" because playing with this thing is addictive. I'll update this review again in 3 months or so, but I don't anticipate any problems.  My only regret is I didn't hold out until a red Pearl came in stock at my local Cingular kiosk.  I would honestly give this phone 4.5 out 5 stars if they let you
Great game for all ages.  Lots of fun if played with many people.  Very intertaining
Inspirational, insightful, funny. Answers the age old question, "But I'm just one person; can I really make a difference?" 
I personally have always enjoyed reading Time magazine long before I became politically aware. I started reading this magazine since I was in my adolescence.Do I think it is liberal biased as some of the other reviewers claims that it is? I don't know and I don't care. I don't read it from a particular point of view. Some of the cover stories in the past may be highly questionable given how shallow they might be but I don't take it personally. One of the best articles I have read in a long time is the issue on high school drop outs. I thought that was quite thought provoking. I didn't think much of the 100 most influential people in the world list. Katie Couric?! C'mon. That woman is to hard journalism as Paris Hilton is to music. I won't even get into Rachel Ray. If people think Time Magazine is too liberal, then go read the National Review. I don't see Time as hard journalism. Half the stuff they publish is fluff pieces.
I am gratefully pleased with product and vendor . . . Very Pleased
I became interested in this after trying a more advanced program for my business. After weeding through too many option that didn't apply, I knew I just needed somthing simple-- a good way to monitor money in, money out. This program is simple and easy to adjust if you make a mistake.  I highly recommend it, as it is exactly as described
My son has been using this table for the last 3 months and absolutely loves it.  He also has the LeapFrog table, but gets bored with just one.  This table is on the opposite side of our (toy-filled) living room, and he will go over to this for a change of pace.  He loves Elmo and likes to hang on to his head and also mouth it.  He likes to use the phone, which he also mouths - just assume he puts his mouth on everything :) - and also the little bowl under Cookie Monster.  So why four stars and not five?  I do wish the base had a bit more weight to it, but he can easily pull up on it without getting the whole toy over although we've had a couple of near tips.  Also, the toy is a little less educational than I feel it could be since he is always accidentally setting off buttons with his arm...so he could be pressing the triangle with his finger, but his arm could press the Pig...and off Elmo goes oinking and singing about pigs.  Still a great toy, with lots of entertainment value, and as he matures we have less accidental set-offs.  I bought it on sale and it was worth the money
I like the different projects and items you can buy - plus they give prices and online addresses. Overall I'm quite pleased with this magazine
It used to be (and it has been a couple years since I have bought a computer game new) that as long as your PC was not too old, you could run any game on it.  No so with Oblivion (and some other new games I believe).  To run Oblivion (as is) you need a machine with a high end graphics card.  So unless you bought a PC specifically for gaming, or specifically updated the graphics card, Oblivion will just quit after the intro screen, without telling you why!  While I readily accept that not having a high end graphics card will mean that games will not look as good, it is frustrating that this game will not even run on my PC (a dual core, with 1G of RAM).  And no, it still does not run if you install the manufacturer's patch. ---  --- However all is not completely lost.  I was able to install "Oldblivion" (just Google for it to find the site) and another patch from the Oldblivion site and now it runs acceptably.  With Oldblivion and the other patch the graphics are still pretty good (better than Morrowind though understandably not nearly as good as the screenshots online), however it tends to crash every so often (its unclear whether or not this is due to graphics incompatibilities or just other bugs in the game). ---  --- Nonetheless, if have a high end graphics card, or have the patience to apply all the unofficial online patches, the game is pretty cool.  I was not a big fan of Morrowind, but Oblivion has a number of improvements over Morrowind (in my opinion): ---  --- 1) You can fast travel (just open up a map and click) to all cities and any sites that you have been to before.  And even when you cannot fast travel to a new place, you can usually walk in a nearly straight line there (in Morrowind it was maddening to go someplace since I often would end up running into mountains that I could not climb) ---  --- 2) Oblivion is not so dark and gloomy, like Morrowind was! ---  --- 3) NPC speak (this to me is a huge benefit, in Morrowind they might utter some cryptic phrase when they saw you but then you would have to to through pages of text dialouge -- if I wanted to read I would pick up a book, not play a computer game!) ---  --- 4) There is a quest arrow that points towards the person you need to see.  In Morrowind it was incredibly tedious to track people down! ---  --- 5) And finally a minor point, the names of people do not look like the programmers mashed the hand on the keyboard (in Morrowind there were quests like "go see ERAJGUKADFHS and ask about SAKDFHSLKDJF".  I just don't need that when I am playing a computer game! ---  --- One thing that I do not care for about Oblivion is the way the monsters level with you.  The first character I had, I got up to level 15 and found myself being beaten up by goblins!  Unless you powergame (that is stragically plan your leveling to maximize stats and combat skills) or turn the difficulty way down, the leveling of monsters makes the game a real pain -- combat related quests (such as with the painted trolls) should not get harder the more you level. ---  --- All in all it is a pretty fun game, but before you buy, make sure you have a high end graphics card (or a lot of patience)! ---  ---  
The Best R&B Band Ever!!! I know some will disagree with me, but this is the band that really rock my boat. I mean, they were awesome and it wasn't forced or fake. The rawness of their funk is sooo addictive that you will never put this cd down. I am in the process of getting ALL their cds, but this one is a great way to be introduce to their music
As a professional photographer, I find myself going through 5-6 of these cords each year. My equipment is my livelyhood and although  it is used often, I am exceptionally careful with all of my gear and do not bang it around or abuse it.  I use a stroboframe which makes it necessary to use this cord to raise the flash well above the focal plane of the camera.  These cords are very expensive to get just a few months out of them.  Eventually, the hot shoe connector will either become loose and the connection will no longer function or the plastic connector will break and your flash unit will fall to the ground. (This has happened twice to me and fortunately I was able to catch the flash unit!) ---  --- The cord is indespensible if you need it, but contact Canon USA and ask them to reengineer this cord or expect to replace them every few months
This is the best invention yet.  I could not believe how warm and smooth the cream felt.  What a difference from cold cream to warm cream.   The cream itself was smoother and yes, buttery!  I love this, this is my best investment yet
I received this as a Christmas gift last year.  I followed the instructions in January, and by March the sprouts flourished into plants.  By summer, I had repotted all of them twice and they are now HUGE.  My friends are always shocked at the growth of my "basil tree", as they call it.  I owe my success to south-facing windows and religious watering (infused with drops of plant food.)  I don't have a green thumb at all - in fact, I'm a known plant-killer.  But I was able to get the Chia herb garden to grow like a charm. 
I started my newborn out using the Avent bottles.  After a few weeks, she began crying alot.  You could hear the gas moving in her tummy, and every time her tummy would grumble, she would pull her legs up and shriek in pain.  She would also pass gas constantly.  It was so difficult to feed her because she would cough, spit and cry the whole time. Then she would be miserable with gas pains for hours afterwards.  I tried switching formulas - didn't work.  Tried mylicon, Zantac, gripe water, bicycling her legs, etc. etc. etc... nothing worked.  The pediatrician diagnosed her with colic and said there was nothing we could do, that she would outgrow it.  Finally, we decided to switch bottles (I switched to Playtex nursers.)  Instantly we noticed a difference!  She was extremely quiet during feedings, didn't squirm or cry!  She began ingesting almost TWICE as much formula per feeding(probably because her tummy was too full of gas to take in any more with the Avent bottles!) and would go longer between feeds. And when she swallowed, it sounded different - you could tell that she was no longer swallowing air!  Something about those Avent bottles made her swallow tons of air.  I think it was the suction that was created inside the bottle as she ate.  With the Playtex nursers, the liner inside the bottle contracts as she eats, eliminating any air bubbles.  She is a completely different baby now.  She is more alert and interacts with us much more because she spends less of her awake time crying. --- So if you decide to buy these bottles - BEWARE.  If you are already using them and your baby has colic, switch immediately!  Don't just assume that colic is "normal" or will be "outgrown."  Babies don't deserve to suffer this way!!!
I am an elementary school teacher previewing this book in order to find a developmentally appropriate text for a study of religion. I am not religious and I strive to take a learner's stance and a scholarly approach to any unit of study that I present to my students. Betsy and Guilio Maestro have written other fabulous books on several topics; books that I have made available to my students for their research because they were accurate and presented without bias. This particular work unfortunately is neither. Their gesture was genuine and gracious, an example of the tolerance they wanted to promote. No deity need take offense; all were included in the pantheon of possibilities. It is however filled with inaccuracies and contradictions and finally a statement of belief by the authors. ---  --- Though written as an overview of many of the world religions, this book culminates in a doctrinal statement of the confusing theology of religious pluralism, the view that no religion is objectively truer than any other. One point ought to be obvious, though: Everything can't be true.  ---  --- The religions mentioned are like oil and water; they can't mix because they represent opposite and competing concepts. An appeal to their similarities doesn't help. We would never say aspirin and arsenic are basically the same just because they both come in tablet form. It's the differences that are critical. That's true in all areas of life, especially the spiritual. ---  --- If God exists, He's either personal or not personal. He can't be both. If God is merely a cosmic energy, why ask His blessing? He can't hear or respond. If He's a person, then He's someone, not everyone. ---  --- This book is not as much a story of religions as it is a recipe for religious stew
The 30 reviews before mine gave pretty complete description about the watch. I'll just say it fits very well on my relatively small wrist. --- If you like the watch but think it won't fit well because you have small wrist. Don't worry, it fits just fine. Enjoy. --- After wearing this watch for few weeks, I realized I am just like many others, wearing the Calibre 2100 exclusively now.
I subscribed in Sept 04 and still have not received any single issue (as of Jan 05). There is no phone number or email address, so the only way to contact them is by mail, only they don't respond. They took my money, and I never heard from them again. ---  --- Finally I had enough and subscribed to Garden Gate Magazine instead. They are prompt and efficient, and the magazine is great
I just bought this iron and I couldn't be happier. It's the perfect size and weight. The plates aren't unmanageably large, or pitifully small... It heats up incredibly fast-- we're talking in less than 60 seconds. I have short-ish, wavy and coarse hair- it's straight and silky smooth within 5 minutes. HAI is a brand used in many salons and it's all for a reason- they make fantastic flat irons. If you bought this same iron at a salon, you could easily pay upwards of $150 in Canada... so I consider this price an awesome deal
I found this toy to be a waste of money.  It was hard for my five year old to close or put more than two things in it.  It says it holds three barbie's and cloths but then how do you close it
Whether you're Greek - or whatever - just about anyone can relate to Toula's life. After having deemed herself hopeless for thirty-odd years, then finally meeting the man of her dreams, Toula's real obstacle is surving her family! While his parents are quiet and typical Americans, Toula's clan embraces their roots -- telling strangers the intimate details of their medical histories, roasting a lamb in the front yard, Gramma in the old-country babushka. You'll laugh til you cry, 'cause chances are, you know someone exactly like each of Toula's relatives..
If you're doing a low-carb diet or looking for snack foods that won't trigger a glycemic reaction, try these amazing cheese snacks.  They are very delicate and pastry-like, crumbling in your mouth. Very savory -- no sweetness. Aunt Lizzie is on to something, and these are a no-compromise low-carb snack
I love the Office.  What I don't love is Amazon listing a 3-disc boxed set of Seasons 1 and 2 and the 2 BBC specials for sale and then mailing me 2 separate discs of Seasons 1 and 2.  So be aware that Amazon is not shipping what they advertise here.  I have contacted them and have had not a reply about this
Lots of bang for your buck if you are a discerning hostess who enjoys offering guests a slightly off-beat non-alcoholic beverage. Really like the packaging. Like the taste too, kind of like Mountain Dew with ginseng.
   There is not enough space for me to explain why this film(and soundtrack) are woefully inadequate of the name Dr. Seuss. ---  ---     The Fact that there are so many songs on the album screams commercialism(what the book was complaining about, wake up people!) and James Horner's score which has a couple of nice moments but doesn't have that Seussian sound. 'Where are you Christmas' is annoying beyond all reason and I mean both versions. And whose bright idea was it to have Jim Carrey mangle 'You're a Mean One'? ---  ---  ---    If you're looking for a more Grinch like score, go find Elfman's Nightmare Before Christmas
Save your money or give it to charity. This is one of the worst films for a long time. The characters are one-dimensional, you don't care who they are and when they die, you're indifferent. The direction and the screenplay are lame and the acting comes right out of a telephone directory. --- I was so bored with this film that I can't even bring myself to write anything else about it
I used to have some Remington shaver that a friend bought me for the last 5 yrs.  It wasn't bad, but sometimes it irritated the skin.  my first shaver was my dad's old school norelco shaver so i thought i'd give them a try again.  the first one i got from amazon was $40 (i forgot the model #) and ended up sending it back to norelco for their 60 day guarantee.  it was just alright.  this one i feel about the same way.  i mean it shaves decently, but as an asian male with not much facial hair, i still see that i have to shave every couple days which i prefer not to.  the cleaning system is cool, and the fact that this shaver is so easy to clean (it says you can open it up and run it under water which i've been doing to clean it) make it worthwhile to me though.  the battery life is also good.  if there was a half star system, i'd give this shaver a 4.5/5
I have an oval table that seats six.  The chairs are both stationary and swivel style.  This fits the set perfectly.  Nice durable canvas fabric, handles to pull to the sides, straps to anchor cover to furniture set.  Only negative is it has pull straps to tighten the cover along the bottom, however, the canvas does not move well enough to really pull it taut.  Great value, though
I've had these chairs for about a week (I bought two) and they look fabulous on my front porch. They are comfortable too. ---  --- My expectations were exceeded. ---  --- Like another reviewer, I too searched for Adirondack chairs and --- found the prices to be ridiculously high. This chair and ottoman --- for $84.99 ($10 shipping) is a steal!! ---  --- The quality and construction seem to far outweigh the price. ---  --- I only gave 4 stars because I can't comment on the durability and maintenance after only a week. Strathwood recommends Teak Oil a couple of times a year. ---  --- I also purchased the 30" folding table to place in between the chairs - what a set !!! ---  --- If you're thinking about this chair, don't hesitate, you will not be disappointed !   ---  ---  --- 
The mounting kit installed easily and is holding a pair of Bose 151 speakers.  It works well for what I need
My wife really likes Martin. After listening to this concert I must say it is indeed a very good live presentation
sounding thing occurred when ex-Springfield Messina melded with Loggins,and it was LARGE!C.S.N.&Y. strove to be this good every time they released a tune. This compilation not only displays the music-crafting  abilities of these two in conjunction,but also showcases their power to  deliver dynamic LIVE performances. dedicated to Todd j
The pores of the face become clogged with makeup, cremes, sunscreens, Bronzing Gels, Powders, etc.   ---  --- Exfoliation, washing, facials, steaming DO NOT REMOVE BLACKHEADS, WHITEHEADS AND CLOGGED PORES.   ---  --- This simple product gets them out!   ---  --- Buying one will last a life time.  No need to buy another ever.... ---  --- The Ultimate cleaning device.... --- 
This book is total self-propogating hogwash.  Garbage. Save your money, and your life, avoid this book like a big mac
Nutty taste, this good for you oil makes great iol based salad dressings
I've been using Avon products since I was a teen.  I started using the eye serum a couple of years ago after Avon discontinued their wonderful eye gel.  I will be 60 this year and have no wrinkles around my eyes and few on my face either, though I am a dry-skinned redhead.  ---  --- Contrary to what someone else here said, I find that it does absorb very quickly.  I buy it because it is NOT oily--oily makeup around my eyes makes my eyes burn, and this gives me no problems at all.  Also, I have sensitive skin so I have to use hypoallergenic makeup.  This fills that bill too.  Try it!!  It's great!!  
i love get fresh products, especially the lemongrass lavendar scent. i use the hand sugar scrub (which is very moisturizing and gets rid of cooking odors on hands). it is very light and pleasant, as are the others. i love the look better naked kit and the relief for tattered tootsies kit. i am a beauty junkie and i have used much more expensive products but i never seem to like them as much as these. great gift- the hatbox design is very cute
The kaffir lime leaves arrived very promptly and had been kept cool.  --- They appear to be quite fresh. --- Have cooked with them, it was wonderful. --- Thank
While this is a functional holster, be aware that you may -- like me - find that your phone hangs up as you extract it from the holster.  I know, I know.  You can turn off the "answer phone when opened" option, but that is not preferred by everyone. ---  --- You may also find that the phone does not stay in the holster securely. --- 
Suit was too small, not enough information available on the site for it. I called Amazon, but even the customer representative was not sure the size. I bought the suit as he suggested, but it is too small
I can't complain about shipping, it was really fast. But i get the thing i plug it in, use it 1 time. The 2nd time i plug it in, the metal piece that plugs into the phone, jams back inside the plastic housing that was holding it, making a freakin paper weight. Cheap piece of cra
I brought Microsoft Windows XP Home Ed.SP2, to use on my Mac BookPro as a guest O/S. The software works fine on my Mac BookPro, the only downside was as soon as it was installed I had to update the software with 98 Security updates. For the software to be new right out of the box, it took up a lot of space on my harddrive with the Security updates, and the updates on my Mac BookPro have only been 6, since the day I brought my computer, compare the difference in updates to see which software has a lot of problems.
I like westerns but in this film Raquel Welch and Dean Martin were down your capacities. Ever will be nice look Welch 's body but the film is only that.
Everyone in my family has owned these clic goggles.  My original pair gave out after three years of use.  I ordered these because they said "standard size" they normally come in small medium and large.  WEll, I am medium and the standard size is large (same as my husbands).  I had to tape them at the back to make them smaller so I could wear them.  Did not have time to return....very disappointed.  Will consider this before ordering from you again.
I ordered this magazine as a gift. I paid for it on Nov. 21 '05. It is now Feb. 19 '06, and my daughter has not yet recieved her Christmas present! I will never again place an order with Amazon! Barnes and Noble has proved to be very efficient and worthy of my business. I will at this point try to get my money back from this company, and my daughter can purchase the magazine and all the missed issues off the newsstand
More wonderful and inspiring poems. Time to be still and thoughtful
I bought two Lexar thumbdrives, over other brands, partially based on their rebate offers. Despite my methodical record keeping and submission, I simply got post cards saying that I did not "meet" the rebate requirements (in place of the rebate checks).  The first time it happened, I thought it was, oh well, my fault, But the same identical thing happened on my second rebate submission. This is simply frank fraud by Lexar, on a smaller scale, therefore not worth customers' time to file a complaint or to pursue it further. I hope the recent fines associated bogus rebates woke up these small time thieves and deterred them from deceiving and conning their customers again
This is a nice product,i buught it beacause i needed to play DVDs from foreign country and my fancy "sony" dvd vcr player can't read them but this little thing can,it reads all the standards i'm glad i've got it. 
While filled with talented performers, this cd sucks.  ---  --- Rocky is a campy, 1970's B-Movie, that's what makes it enjoyable. Even as a stage show it's a hokey, rock-and-roll extravaganza.  ---  --- This cd tries to turn Rocky into Thoroughly Modern Millie, and it just doesn't work. The corny sci-fi sound and less than amazing vocals are just what make Rocky..Rocky. This cast has so much less enthusiasm and energy than the original Roxy cast. ---  --- And lastly, Tim Curry is Frank. His rendition is too ingrained in my head for me to accept the twangy annoyance that is the Frank on this album. Ripley is a little too legit for Janet, and the female Eddie weirds me out.  ---  --- Buy the Roxy cast. It's so superior it's almost laughable.
I've tried this razor for 5 weeks, both wet and dry and can only say that this is the worst electric razor that I've ever used. It doesn't give a close shave and requires a second shave with a standard razor to remove some of the stubble. I should --- have bought a new Norelco instead of this. My old Norelco always --- shaved me close. This Panasonic would still be handy as a travel razor, or to be used in a pinch. But for a close shaving everyday razor, this isn't the one to buy.  --- Oh well, I waited too long to send it back
Love the wireless connection to my HP all-in-one scanner printer. Works great
This is one of the best G3s.  Maybe even the best.  I would have said that it was definitely the best if not for Mr.Malmsteen - the nicest thing one can say about the latter is that he knows his minor and major scales. ---  --- But *I* don't want to be nice.  I want to be absolutely and unequivocally cruel when it comes to Malmsteen. ---  --- He knows alternate picking, I'll give him that.  But then, so do I - and a million others.  He shouldn't be up there playing with Vai and Satriani solely because he can alternate pick faster than most (not all) people .  And yet he is. ---  --- He shows over and over again, in this show, that the only thing he can do with the guitar is shred and shred and shred some more.  That's all. One of the interesting things about this DVD is that one cannot really measure the time between two consecutive shredding runs that Yngwie chooses to execute - it's less than about a second.  And this is an *average* figure. ---  --- Enough about Yngwie, though he is the reason I'm writing this review - Satriani is absolutely amazing, as usual, with a brand new rendition of 'Midnight' and a nice solo at the end of 'Starry Night'. ---  --- Vai, though, steals the show.  This coming from a guy who prefers Satriani.  But I can't help it - he is really that good.  And better.  'I Know You're Here'(which he plays on a triple neck Jem) contains at least seven new approaches to the same old things that you're taught at guitar school.  It is also the best song Steve Vai has ever written after 'Fire Garden Suite'.  ---  --- 'Juice' and 'I'm the Hell Outta Here' are also really really really good. ---  --- Overall, a great DVD, though you should probably skip the parts with Yngwie in it
I absolutely love this case! The cool thing about it is that it doesn't look like a regular laptop case (i.e. the bulky, usually black, boring, case). My best friend didn't even know it was a laptop case and fell in love with the bag itself! It makes a great gift for any soon-to-be college student
My older son has been taking drums for several months and doing very well.  For Christmas we bought him an electronic drum kit and needed to get a throne also.  I found this one on Amazon and have been very happy with the quality and the price
Giorgio Armani is know for his excellence and fineness when it comes to his clothing, accessories, bags and of course: Fragrances. Acqua di Gio is remarkable, distinguished, and flawless in every sense. It has been the best-selling cologne since its release and has become synonymous with sexy. 99% of people (men and women) who come in contact with you on the daily basis will compliment you on your smell (at least in my case.) I'm not complimented on any cologne I own more than this one so I usually wear it when I know I'll be in contact with more than a few people. This fragrance is truly awe-inspiring and it proves once again that when it comes to delicate scents, Armani is king
There is absolutely nothing special about this leave-in conditioner, besides the fact that it smells really good.  However, I didn't see any changes in my daughter's hair after using this conditioner.  NONE.  It is watered down so you must rub it in your hair very quickly. Otherwise, it will run down your face and neck (wish it came with a spray pump instead).  I was expecting some sort of difference since this product line is well-known and has a lot of star/ celebrity power behind it.  However, I found this conditioner to be all hype
There's nothing in this I'd say even remotely resembles jazz. It's repetitive, has a rock beat, and consists mostly of licks taken from other players. If you're looking for backrgound music to play in a waiting room, this might be a good choice
I agree completely with the previous reviewer--this licorice does not even come close to the usual quality of --- Haribo candy.  This stuff is dry and hard, and it leaves your hands sticky with waxy grease.  And the flavor--what little there is--is just weird: kind of a fake floral.  NOT recommended
OK I eat a lot of protein/fiber bars and most taste like cardboard or something worse.  This bar is the best - I eat it for breakfast, lunch or as dessert after dinner. The texture reminds me of a chewy rice crispy treat - seriously. Love it
I absolutely loved this DVD.  I saw in on TV, but wanted a permanent edition for my 'supes' collection.  I highly recommend it for anyone interested in the history of Superman, its origins and where he fits into our culture today.  It's great
This product is a very simple to use, extremely efficient tool.  I am very pleased with results it produced for me
It's been 30 years since I've seen this film on cable.  I decided to re-visit this obscure film and see if I missed anything in the initial viewing.  As it turned out, I didn't miss anything.  It's pretty much the same, routine Sam Peckinpah film, filled with lots of blood, guts, bullets and slow-motion action.  It's also a long, tedious film that is not one of his best, but will satisfy those who enjoy ultra-violence in their movies
I PLACED A WRONG ORDER AND SO NOW I AM NOT ABLE TO WATCH THE DVD I PURCHASED. IT WAS  FOR AREA NO 1, BUT WE CAN'T WATCH THE NO 1 AREA MOVIES IN TURKEY. --- THEREFORE I DO NOT HAVE A REVIEW 
Great slide!!  No assembly required, just unfold and your ready for fun..perfect size for young toddlers.  Bright colors and cute, happy carrot face.  Great fun for indoors or out
Bag is attractive and very sturdy.  The computer fits securely and is well padded.  I recently used it on a trip and was able to place other carry on items in it and it traveled well
The mattress pad topper has a strong chemical smell. After receiving it, I left it in an open room for 2 weeks before I can sleep on it. The "free" pillow smells even worse. It can be not exchanged since it is "free". I guess I am supposed to toss it since it's "free".                 I think it will be fair to mention that the topper is comfortable, after all.
HP is selling this bag for $30 bucks, so when I found it here for $10 less I couldn't let this "Deal" pass me by... however when I received the bag, I wished I had... the color is less vibrant, it's cheap, poor quality, plus HP isn't embroidered on the bag... walk away from this bag and get the blue and black HP bag instead, it costs a little bit more but it's well worth it!!
I am disappointed in this product. --- I was suppose to write to you from the weekend. --- My two rear speakers just stop working, and also my --- remote control. I have replace the batteries, but still --- does not work. --- I don't have any other rear speakers to try on the system. --- Pleasy me what to do. ---  --- Thank you --- Epiphane Flaviu
My nephew loves this gift. In fact, he wouldn't allow his sister to play with it, so now she also has one
I have enjoyed "Goldfish" and other cheese-based snack crackers since I was a child, but no more. I tried these Cheddar Bunnies as I have enjoyed other products by Annie's, and have now found my all-time favorite snack cracker.  ---  --- From a nutritional standpoint, they are better than many competing products as they have no hydrogenated oils or artificial flavors, and are made from organic ingredients, including real Wisconsin cheddar cheese. The packaging does an excellent job of preserving freshness, the taste is natural and very refreshing for a snack food, and the price is comparable to other non-organic products.  ---  --- I am completely satisfied with these crackers: the are a good value, they compare favorably in the nutritional realm with competitors (although they really don't qualify as "health food," of course,) they taste fantastic, and last but not least, they're fun
My husband and his friend likes to hike and one day he and his friend met some people out of state--they wanted to share email address---no one had a pen/pencil so my husband's friend pulls out his pocket knife and inside it is a pen to write with.  Everyone was so excited to know there is a swiss army signature with a pen to write with inside.   --- My husband looked everyone where in stores for this same knife set cause he wanted one just like it---could not find it so I did some searching on the net and bought it for his Christmas gift---he was so excited to receive it on Christmas morning.  Thanks  
Surprisingly, its been hard to find a two compartment dish for baby food.  This one works great and comes with a nice spoon that fits on top of the dish for storage.  It is a great size and lightweight for taking in the diaper bag for eating out too
I recently purchased a pair of the Gripmaster Hand & Finger Exercisers in order to help build forearm strength.  As I was unsure which tension would be appropriate, I bought one each of the Light/Blue (5 lbs. tension) and Medium/Red (7 lbs. tension) grips.  I've had them for a little more than a week now, and I just love, love, love them!  Perhaps that's a little more enthusiasm than anyone should muster up for exercise accessories, but I really do enjoy the grips.  I leave one out on my desk at all times, and get in a little work here and there when I stop to read a document or whatnot.   ---  --- The Gripmaster Exercisers are different from conventional grips in that you can either work your entire hand at once, or each finger individually (great for guitar players, I've heard!).  One side features four small levers, each with its own spring, that can be squeezed together or one at a time.  The plastic on the flip side is molded together so that you can work your whole hand as one unit.  The black rubber cushion is removable, and you can place it on either side of the grip.  It's an awesome idea, and allows for maximum versatility!   ---  --- Just for reference, I'm a female, in relatively good shape, but with painfully little forearm strength (my biceps are huge from years of Tae Bo, though!).  The 7 lb. Medium/Red grip is do-able, but challenging.  The 5 lb. Light/Blue grip, on the other hand, makes for a much easier workout; I oftentimes find myself squeezing it while doing other things, and I only feel it after a number of reps.  If you're a female and not in great shape, you'll want to start out with the Light/Blue grips (or even the Extra Light/Yellow ones), and work your way up.  Out-of-shape guys can probably get away with the Medium/Red ones to start.  If you've got good hand/wrist/forearm strength, don't even both with the lighter tensions - skip ahead to the Medium/Red or Heavy/Black.    ---  --- Although I've only owned my Gripmasters for a week or two, and can't personally vouch for their durability, they do seem sturdy and well-crafted.  My fianc's brother, an amateur boxer and guitar player, used his for years without a problem, so I have faith that I'll be squeezing these babies well into 2015! ---  --- - Kelly Garbato, Couch Potato Turned Fitness Fanati
Perfectly in keeping with the imperialist ethos that he so proudly and loudly espouses, Boot has foisted upon us a book that rests entirely on the labors of others.   ---  --- Lacking even the slightest trace of shame, he plunders concepts and ideas from anyplace in the intellisphere he chooses.  As a result, there's nary a new thought nor insight to be found anywhere within these pages. ---  --- Even more pitiably, like a renegade third world nuclear scientist trying to "sanitize" his clandestinely-acquired apparatus of any markings that might possibly identify its source, Boot assiduously scrubs away any subtleties and nuance that the original thoughts may have possessed.  One wearies quickly of the Manichaean results. ---  --- And like any ideologically-driven but technically inept would-be nuclear (or social) engineer, he fails utterly in his attempt to enrich his raw material even minimally, succeeding only in rendering it more toxic and hazardous than it originally was. ---  --- Why, even the title itself has been purloined from Alistair Home's 1977 underground classic, "A Savage War of Peace"!*  Considering that Home's tome arrives at essentially the opposite conclusions from Boot's, this is irony most profound. ---  --- It is scarcely surprising, then, that recent history has thoroughly discredited the philosophies and policies so ear-splittingly trumpeted in Boot's book, thus rendering moot any lingering interest one might have had in perusing it -- unless one wishes to take counsel for the future by ruminating upon the Ozymandian ruins of Boot's espoused belief system. ---  ---  --- * Recently reprinted and highly recommended! --- 
i received my order of three oils...jasmine,ambergris, and musk...their fragrance was so obscured by the oil medium that you cut the essential oil with that they all smelled very close to the same...i have caswellmassey oils from 30 years ago and they are still true to their fragrance and it is true...one drop will last all day and often linger for more...have they sold out or sold their name ---   --- i only ordered three oils because somewhere i read if you order 25 dollars or more from you the shipping was free...this was not the case...i was charged for shipping ---   --- these products i received are a joke...the caswellmassey name is no longer associated with an exemplary product...i am sure the original caswellmassey folks are turning over in their graves every time you send this "jokeoil" to an unsuspecting customer...shame on you...shame on you all ---   ---  
I purchased this shampoo for my daughter after she read rave reviews in a teen magazine.  She has thick, blonde hair and it was dry from summer heat, pool water, and light styling.  After trying the rehab shampoo, she was so disappointed that it did nothing to help her hair.  She said that while it lathered nicely, it felt like it stripped her hair and when it rinsed out, it left her hair overly 'squeeky' and tangled.  The end result once her hair was dried (after using conditioner, too), was that it was a lighter shade of blonde, very fly-away, and dry feeling.  She was hoping for smoother, easier to manage hair.  We debated purchasing this shampoo because of its high cost, and I have to say we are extremely disappointed.  The claims were hype, and the results were not delivered.  Her hair was by no means 'fried' or severely damaged, so I fully expected her to have some more manageable locks after using the product, based on its claims.  I will say that I bought her a shampoo and condition at the drug store that has helped dramatically.  It is Thermasilk Smooth & Silky line, and it works wonders over Rehab for a fraction of the cost.  Save your money on this one
Of the printed daily newspapers, WSJ is easily the superior in just about every aspect that really matters. NYT has a lot more and better photographs, but they are best viewed on a computer screen. There's not much to argue (regarding the relatively conservative editorial page) in this review that hasn't already been written; and one more center-right Midwesterner's recommendation is not going to be of much incremental value. However, as an investor and consumer I can state that WSJ and its website have been the primary source of credible information about businesses, law, finance and consumer products. Anybody that works for a living, has a mortgage or has a long-term savings plan would benefit from reading the WSJ as often as possible. There's simply no substitute
This is my favorite toning workout and I'm sure to incorporate it into my routine for my once a week tone-fest. What I like best about it is that I can customize it to whatever body part I think needs the most work this week. Need a 30 minute ab workout? You can choose it. Think the arms and legs need work? No problem. Want to tone a little bit of everything? You can do that, too. ---  --- The instructors are all good - clear, not irritating, and they come up with some unique exercises to work each body part - it's not your standard crunches for ab work on this video.  ---  --- This was one of my best purchases, workout-wise. I wish there were more DVD's/workouts out there with Minna Lessig - she is my favorite instructor (she does the arm/leg workouts on this DVD). The other two instructors are wonderful as well - and the workout just seems to fly by, although at the end you do know you've worked those muscle groups.
I really enjoy top down and side scrolling shooters, so take this opinion with that in mind.  The only problem with R-Type is that dying sucks.  When you die you restart from a usually bad position without any powerups.  Once you unlock free-play this can make the game frustrating when you are playing new stages or playing with a different ship etc.  However overall I think it's the best of the R-types and one of the better side scrollers out there.
MSR's Pocket Rocket is a great little cooker.  Best for going light and fast. Perfect as a shared stove among two people, and even better for simple boiling or melting snow for drinking water. I would suggest this stove for use with a maximum pot capacity of two liters, more than this and it becomes a little unstable. --- If your menu is simple and you live on instant meals that require only boiling water this is the stove for you. Because this is a stove designed for the minimalist, it is tiny and has a very concentrated hot spot, so if you are a backcountry gourmet and want to cook pancakes and eggs you might be better off with a stove that has a larger flame spread.  Again, great for boiling water and melting snow, but not for actual cooking
I switched to this phone from Verizon e815. Some of the details I find different: ---  --- Pros: --- Sleek design --- Good battery life --- Compact --- 2MP camera ---  --- Cons: --- Choppy voice sometimes hard to listen --- Screen and buttons little small ---  --- Works for me as I don't use the phone for internet/email or use lot other features
 I was completely satisfied with the phone clip I purchased. It`s sturdy and well constructed. I would recommend it.I will use this site again
While some critics can argue with Dan Brown's research and reasoning on certain historical points, one thing these Da Vinci "debunking" presentations will never be able to refute is this: the downplaying of the feminine role in western civilization and Christianity, primarily by the Catholic Church, and the fact that the Church still considered Mary Magdalene a common prostitute until just a few short years ago: 1969. Nor is it possible to refute the recent polymorphously perverse scandals that have rocked the Church after centuries of suppression and may have everything to do with the doctrinal distortions that Dan Brown has brought out in the open for serious review. This institution is in trouble because it is seriously out of balance with itself and has cut off its spiritual nose to despite its face by downplaying or denigrating the role of women as sacred beings and bearers of the Light, when their healthy presence is needed more than ever as a corrective to some of these abuses and scandals. Dan Brown has done the world a great service by showing how the feminine role in the divine was written out 2000 years ago, with help from Peter whose misogynistic views of women are plainly evident in the scriptures even today and are still, quite frankly, shocking and debasing. Sorry, but upon this "Rock" of male dominancy was built the Church. ---  --- Thank you again, Dan Brown, by bringing these matters into the light of day so people can know more of their authentic history or at least do their own research to make up their own minds about which spiritual path is best for them and which ones were built on two millenniums worth of manipulations, obscurations and lies. These obscurations and lies happened through the efforts of a group of petty, insecure and misguided men down through the centuries to ensure their dominance and control over the masses, and they found a way to dominate not only the minds of the masses but their vast material resources, worth trillions, through guilt, control and other hidden but consistent abuses of power. And those of orthodox faith who continue to blindly support such hypocritical institutions have a lot more to answer for than any twenty Dan Browns put together. People are angry and they are angry at the failure of religion to live up to its own standards of behavior and for distorting what may have been Jesus' actual relationship with the women in his life--or were the disciples just supposed to be members of a exclusive Men's Club with Jesus as head and women as a species relegated to second class citizenship? To answer these questions, some of you will finally have to turn to your own heart and mind for a change instead of some literal interpretation of the truth, because not everything of the light is found in scriptures or on the printed page, especially after the scriptures have been selectively riddled with scissors for reasons of self-interest or from spiritual corruption. The next thing people should ask for is to have the vaults of the Vatican thrown open for public view. Lord only knows what plunder they contain
Based on negative reviews, either I've been knitting too long to still have good sense, or completely in the dark when it comes to this magazine. It is my favorite, and I do not always follow patterns exactly but use ideas in my own sweaters. I found about 6 cardigans in just the last 2-3 issues (a reviewer didn't find any in a couple years of issues). Re Zimmerman-type designs, you can make any sweater in one or two pieces, change gauge, needle sizes, yarns, etc. Search Websites to give you the basics for free. After 2 years of crochet, I learned to knit at age 8 with 2 pencils for needles, found that quad-ruled pads were great to chart patterns whether plain, fancy, Aran, Jacquard, sideways or you-name-it. I like Knit 'N Style. Thanks for reading this
This is an imaginative take on the Jack and the Beanstalk story. While it was apparently made for kids, the story maintains enough complexity to keep adults interested (I'm 19). Plus as a female, I appreciate the fact that it's one of the few stories where (possible spoiler) the damsel (who's in a different kind of distress than other fairy tale women) rescues Prince Charming.  Well-acted, it features some great chemistry between Sara and Modine.   ---  --- But I still can't give it 5 stars.  Here's why (spoilers ahead): ---  --- 1. I'm no math person but why couldn't the writers be consistent with when Jack's dad died? One minute, they say he died 20 years ago but then they say he died when Jack was 14. Since Jack is 37, it shows that the writers can't do simple addition. Couldn't they just take two seconds to do the math?  ---  --- 2. How the hell does Siggy know about goose and harp? I got the impression from Wilhemina that Jack's dad didn't believe the story of the original Jack. But apparently, Jack's dad told Siggy not to tell him about the family's dark secret until he was ready. I wish there was a more believable explanation for Siggy knowing a lot more than he should.  ---  --- 3. If Siggy is smart enough to know the all the Robinson secrets, I think he should be able to catch on to the fact that Jack is in love with Ondine fairly quickly. I always wondered why he didn't try to kill Ondine when he was so against Jack having an heir.  I understand that they had a time limit to the movie and maybe it would have been a bit scary for the little ones. Don't get me wrong, I don't want Ondine to die.  I wanted nothing less than a happy ending for her and Jack.  But shooting her (or at least threatening her) would have been a great way to kick up the tension/suspense.  ---  --- 4. Siggy's accent and mannerisms were an attempt at comedy that --- completely fell flat. It was not funny and was a bit gratuitous. ---  --- But if you're a fan of romance, adventure, or just feel-good movies in general, those things shouldn't keep you from enjoying this film.  Don't think too much about the plot holes- you'll go insane if you do
This is the third time I have purchased Handyman Magazine for family members as gifts.  This time, I misunderstood how to gift the item.  Unfortunately, I did not have a second chance to send the magazine to a family member as a Christmas Gift.  After calling, the only recourse I was given was to to refuse the magazine when it comes (because it is coming to me instead of my son in Atlanta), call and cancel the order and reorder.  Unfortunately, doing this, it will not reach my son in time for Christmas.  I would like to see something built into the system that gives a second chance to bill me, but send as a gift
It cost a little more, but it's worth it.  It keeps the last 5 temperatures so you can compare
This is our second Weber grill in the past 10 years.  In fact the new grill is essentially the exact same grill as the one we purchased in the '90s...same size and features.  We actually use natural gas rather than propane (I goofed on the order), but we were able to quickly transplant the conversion kit from the old grill to the new one.  We've used it a few times and it works perfectly.  Quickly heats up and grills evenly.  Looking forward to many years of great meals off this grill
For those have back pain or sciatica nerve pain, you have to try this. I didn't believe this until one of my colleague let me tried it for a few days. It makes a big difference with my situation.
Herf applies a very simplistic test to determine the Nazification of both Germanies: did they side with Israel in the Middle East version of the Cold War or did they not? The trial against Paul Merker in the East, which had as its background East Germany's reluctance to pay reparations to expropriated Jews, serves as his prime evidence for the continuation of things Nazi in the GDR. But both of these arguments completely ignore the Marxist ideology underlieing the rationale of the East German leadership and bypass more complicated issues of political allegiance. Moreover, they totally eclipse the East German cultural discourse on the Holocaust, a discourse that was decades ahead of discussions in the West and still proves to be more sophisticated than most that is being written in Western academia.
I added this toy to my son's xmas list. With much luck he did get it; and we are pleased ! I would not say that it's a "fun to play with" toy but the entertainment value still exists. The planets are large enough without being overbearing up on the ceiling. They glow at night..which is the best part !! At 36 years old I can't wait for  nighttime to hang in my sons room to check out the  planets!  The stars the set comes with are perfect. They are NOT the bulky plastic ones that can be seen day or night. They are paper stickers that disappear during the day (on the celing they do anyway) The planets come with name stickers which adds educational value. My son is five and LOVES, LOVES, LOVES these planets. I say get 'em !! ---  ---  Lisa Avilio-Meyer
I bought the smaller version "Diaper Decor" (as opposed to the larger "Diaper Decor Plus") about 18 months ago.  Although I believe the smaller version has been discontinued about a year ago, I have not yet had a problem finding the refill liners at my local Babies R Us or on-line here at Amazon.  I highly recommend the Diaper Decor. I do not have any experience with the Diaper Genie, so I cannot compare. I have not had any odor problems with the Diaper Decor.  It is very easy to change the liners and there is no mess. My foot-operated lid opener also broke like some other reviewers, but this has not been a problem with me.  I just open the lid manually and leave it open while I am changing the diaper. I would recommend the Diaper Decor in the Plus size
Someone mentioned that this is just a glorified trash bag.  It is not.  It is pretty durable and with careful use will last a long time
I never played the original and don't really want to. This game was such a treasure to find with it's phenomonal music and graphics, engrossing gameplay, twisted plot, and the variety of characters possible to play. I have lost a lot of sleep over this game and I'm not even half way done. ---  --- If anything, it has some of the best show of PS2 graphics I have seen-something to expect from a Square-Enix production. The wind moving through the environments, the water trickling, the sort-of dream-like haze in the towns. It all culminates into an eye-pleaser if nothing else. But the gameplay and game engineering is also top quality. The character designs are very diverse with many periods of time and cultures represented. There is a fairly even mix of female and male characters as well as classes like archers, light warriors, mages, ect.  ---  --- The menu navigation and ability to load different game data at anytime (other than combat) is a serious perk that many take for granted. You can keep loading a game when you don't get the einherjar you want until the randomized selection gives you the perfect group you are looking to adventure with. The ability to instantly travel to any location on the map without lengthy travel from location to location keeps the pace nice and brisk giving you only what you want, buying equipment and battles.  ---  --- The difficulty is right where it needs to be, if you do a quick run game, you will have a tough time beating the boss. It's nice not to have leveling forced on you but rather as an elective thing so that you can get through the story when you want to. The battles are clever, mixing tactical RPG with action making it very engaging and actually fun. There is a degree of button mashing, but then again, it's not a static or boring as the your turn, my turn, cast a spell, drink a potion. It's actually combat, like it should be.  ---  --- I can't praise this game enough...I don't care how good the first was, it can't be better than this one. This will certainly go down as a best title for the PS2. If I had any complaints, it would be the recycled voice-commentary for different einherjar and the fact that they really aren't involved with the main story-line. Oh, and since they would be stupid not to make a third one, customizable armor would have been the cream of the crop. VP2 is a solid offering for the last PS2 has to offer
I had a few of these covers in lilac and sage and i cant use any of them anymore, they all shrank so much when washed that they wont even stay on the contoured pad. i am now using a white cover from especially for baby which fits and washes great, unfortunately dirt shows and it stains easily. and they only have white blue and yellow and my daughters room is purple pink green and white
All this box does is make tones to slow down your breathing. I looked at it for a long time, I never found a clear explanation of what it actually is.  So I tried it and it seems like it should cost about $11.99. Save your money
Seriously, I don't know how anyone can use this thing.  I have had tatoos, waxing, and dental fillings, and I would rather have any and all of those before I ever try this product again.  It feels like an electric shock and continuous pulling of duct tape on your skin.  Just awful.  In the products defense, I don't think there is a way to make this device easy to use and leg friendly (God forbid you try it anywhere else, ladies!!).  I was able to remove the hair from about 2 inches of my leg and I gave into the pain and went back to shaving.  Yikes
or in their entire career for that matter.  I have tried to like this band, but Greg Dulli just won't shut up.  Every song is his snide lyrical diatribing, on and on and on.  The guitarist keeps things mildly interesting, but on this album in particular, the drummer also won't shut up and play a straight beat for once.  It's like three guys in their own worlds, and they mash it together and call what they've done songs.  EXCEPT for the one decent song they did, the only rock song I can think of that is hard, psychedelic, passionate, powerful, and set to a waltz beat of all things.  "LEt me lie to you" is the best song they ever made, BECAUSE everyone in the band is given room to breathe by the song's framework and tempo.  Instead of piling in on top of each other till the end of the song like they usually seem to do, everyone agrees to hold back until the rushing choruses, and it's less muddled and better orchestrated for it.  IT's a shame they didn't do any other songs like this, at least none that I have heard.  I tried to like them, I really did.  I wanted to find the band that made that one song, and discover a whole treasure chest of dark, passionate, noisy music like that.  Too bad, no wonder they drifted apart
I am a huge fan of Tasty Bite products, and was delighted to find that Amazon now stocks them, since they are expensive in my small town (no Trader Joe's here!). I was excited to see this variety that I had never tried before, and readily ordered the six pack of these noodles with peanut sauce, expecting the same ready-to-eat food that the other Tasty Bites I have tried offer. ---  --- But unlike their ready-to-eat rice dishes in which the rice and the packet merely need heating but are already fully cooked, the noodles here are in their raw state and need to be boiled for ten minutes, so you can't grab this and bring it to work the way you can most other Tasty Bite meals. ---  --- Also, the peanut sauce has a delectable and complex flavor, but is spiced and textured so that I felt it really needed some vegetables and or meat to round it out. I love spicy dishes, but this meal seemed planned to be overly spiced so that when you add the veggies and meat, it would be perfect. ---  --- So, as a quick meal starter at home or as a way of helping to use up leftover meat and veggies, this gets five stars. It was delicious. Some additions I have enjoyed are chicken, steak, bell pepper, cauliflower, carrots, eggplant, and sweet potato.  ---  --- But I am giving this meal four stars overall because my expectation from eating other Tasty Bite entrees was that this was a grab and go meal that I could pop in the microwave and have prepared in a couple of minutes.
Does NOT maintain water temp. Splashes all over AT the proper water level. Rollers hurt. Noisy. Weak vibrations. I wouldn't want one for $5
Can't really go wrong here.  A metal post, some rubber grips, and a couple of wheels.  It works great, and was the cheapest I found.   ---  --- Just a tip, if you've never used it before, don't try to be a tough guy and do a rep from your feet.  You may be tough, but you might also hurt your back.  Start on your knees until you know for sure you're a tough guy
i had reasently bought this vibrator because i like trying out did kinds of vibrators to get more pleasure from and well i would have to say this one and my magic wand vibrator, well i like this one better because it is cordless so i can use it anywhere in my home even away from an outlet like in my car and no cord gets in the way. it also has a very flexable soft head that feels really very good when i use it. it has really strong motor that can make me have some exteme orgasms that fell very good. and last it looks to be made very well so it probly will last pretty long i hope so.
I think his debut had the best lyrics. This joint gets off to a good start with We Still Party and pretty much bangs till the end. His production on here is best described as "Late 90's Roger Troutman-esque G-Funk".  --- Geust Stars like 2nd II NOne, AMG, Suga Free and El Debarge get their shine on. ---  --- Top Joints: --- We Still Party  (Peter Gunz and Quik on the track) Quik jacks the VERB song from School House Rock. (The Jam) --- So Many Wayz   --- Hand In Hand  --- You'z A Ganxta  (Quik refutes rumors that he was involved in Biggie's demise. Also denounces reference to death in rap songs.) --- I Useta Know Her (Should be called I Useta Hit That) --- Speed   --- Medley for a 'V' (The P***y Medley)   --- Get 2Getha Again (Class of 91, 2nd II None, AMG and Quik triple team on this track.)   --- Reprise (Medley For A 'V)
This dryed my skin out really bad and it didn't even work. ---  --- Dont use this
This battery arrived fast, fits, and works well. I highly recommend this seller
The cards are beautiful and reflect the care that was taken to design and assemble them. There is a good variety of colors and styles. However, there is a lack of cards appropriate for male recipients. The cards are mostly for female recipients. Nonetheless, it's a great product and I enjoy giving these cards to others for special occasions
My wife and I have slightly different tasates in coffee, I like mine darker and she like a milder coffee.  This one however is just right for both of us.  I drink it daily without cream or sugar (which I only do when I actually enjoy the flavor of the coffee).  And we are on our second 5 pound bag!  I wish we had found this coffee sooner, it is great
The first edition of Don't Look Back was the first DVD I ever bought and I bought a DVD player the same day.  ---  --- It is an execellent example of the power and pitfalls of "cinema verite/direct cinema", a style emerging in the 1960s made possible by lightweight sound sync cameras and recorders, zoom lenses, and fast film stock.  The "who threw the f-- glass" altercation followed by the cruel juxtoposition of Donovon offering "Song for You" to which Dylan responds with a smirk and "It's All Over Now Baby Blue" is one of the great passages in documentary film. ---  --- You may love or hate Dylan's music and after watching the film, you aren't left with any illusions about him being a nice person.  But he is a force of nature.  Lyrics poured through him, some timely, some timeless, raw ones and delicate ones.  For me he was always better on recordings than in person, and the film reminds me why.  But I'm glad to have this glimpse of  the artist. ---  --- I don't know about the "deluxe edition".  It may be worth it for the higher quality telecine transfer.  The original film does not need amplification.  It reveals more about Dylan than the bloated "No Direction Home" that used so much of the same footage
One tiresome, heavy-handed simile after another; agonizing, descriptive detail that unnecessarily prolongs action; simplistic, trite phrasing and dialogue -- characters constantly express vague but contradictory emotions in the same sentence, an obvious effort by the author to provoke interest or conflict which falls flat; routine characterization; a sentence or two slipped in during a scene or an unexpected circumstance placed at the end of a chapter meant to build plot and suspense read as forced and predictable; proofreading errors; fragmented, poor sentence structure -- this book is amateurish writing all the way around.  I cannot fathom the reasoning for the quality of the professional reviews which this work received.  I cannot understand the lack of proper editing.  I am an avid reader and approached this book with much enthusiasm, so imagine my disappointment when I was ready to put the book down a couple of pages into the Prologue!  In fairness to the author (and with a hopeful attitude), I forced myself through the first 70 or so pages, however with each turning page I found myself reading along just for sport, my mind constantly drifting and more and more incredulous (and annoyed) with this juvenile effort. What could have been a fascinating read due to the intriguing premise is instead a colossal waste of time. 
I write very few reviews, but I just wanted to share my unbelievable success with healing my cracked heels.  I have fought this battle many years, with no success.  I started using this stuff 3 weeks ago, along with a heel sander, and I only have a small scar that I suspect will go away.  I cannot believe the results!!!  I only wish I had taken pictures to proof the results!!  But who wants to look at UGLY cracked heels???  LOL...it WORKS!!!!!!!!!
These socks are just what I was looking for, a thin cotton blend to wear running.  No bunching and they breath very well.  The price and timliness of the order was also great
This product works great for water retention. I like that it doesn't keep you running to the ladies room, works great
The remote worked only for 2 days. My daughter loves the look of it so I am not able to dispose it off. Its a total waste of money. I wish I had read the reviews before buying it since lot of people seem to have the same problem with the remote.
The cookies are great. We've been eating them for about 7 years. Cannot find them in our local stores all the time. Thank
When my baby was a newborn we left our closet light on all night at first so we could check on him.  It was also a jarring necessity to turn on the overhead light for diaper changes and feedings.  Then I bought one of these lights and was impressed at the perfect amount of light it gives out.  Just enough to see your baby by, but not enough to keep everyone awake.  It's been almost a year now, and I'm just about to purchase two more.  We use the light now in our toddler's room and turning it on is now part of our bedtime routine.  We use it every night
We used the travelling toddler on our vacation with our 11 month-old son to Mexico.  We always buy him his own seat on the plane for his safety and it was a very convenient way to get through the airport with his seat and luggage.  He was attached to our rolling carry-on curbside and off we went.  We were able to check our stroller and we had little to carry.  At $20, you can't beat the price.  Our friends had to carry their car seat, stroller, luggage and child and were wishing they would have bought the strap
I am very happy with it but it doesn't live up to my expectations. --- I also have the reg. Plus for XP and I really don't think the extra money is worth it.  If I were to do over I would still have bought the Plus superpack for XP but not the regular Plus just because I do have a Media Center PC. If I didn't have that the regular Plus for XP would have been just fine
I like flavored coffees but not my husband. That's part of why we got Keurig maker. Have started trying the different flavors and this is the dessert-y kind of flavor I'm looking for (and my other top favorite so far is Green Mountain's Caramel Vanilla Cream). Been making it on the 8oz mug setting and just fine
I ordered these disposable pampers for my son.  They are great.  I ordered them and recieved free 2 day shipping
The move is one of my favorite sci-fi films but this is the worst job of trasferring to DVD that I have seen. There are no special features and NO CHAPTER STOPS, this is as if they copied a video tape to a DVD. I could accecpt it being full frame but if I had known that it was this cheap a transfer I would not have purchased it
These are a perfect size for work and great portion control! I ordered a case for the ladies at work and we split it. If you are counting calories this is the way to go
I got Very Irresistible by Givenchy Perfume as a gift for Christmas.  As first smell, I loved it.  Then I spritzed it and yikes! That was 2 months ago and I still have the scent on me. ---  --- It's too flowery -- it's not a clean, fresh scent.  More of a "I sprayed a little too much potpouri in here" scent.  Not for people with mild allergies to perfumes either!!
It took no time to figure out how to use this seat.  My daughter meets the minimum height and weight requirements, so I am moving here from a 5 point harness Britax to this booster in a second car.  The seat is easy to install and remove, and also easy to stowe in the trunk when not in use by simply pulling the rear latch and folding.  I can definately see using it for travel on planes, as it is easy to fold and light enough to carry.  My daughter also likes the fold out cup holders for water.  They are sturdy and easy to tuck back in when storing or carrying the seat.  Highly recommended.
I was very impressed to find this very nice book. I've heard about a Quebecois who painted for the popular singer Celine Dion (I'm from Quebec, Canada myself), I wanted to see and I'm very proud of it. Huge ceilings and wonderful murals !  Wow. Felicitations 
Flavor is just passable. The cracker is too thick,& have not found a topping that will soften it..
WHAT A WASTE OF FIM! TOO SNIDE FOR MY TASTE. MAYBE IT'D BEEN ENTERTAINING BACK IN THE 60'S, BUT TODAY IT'S ATTEMPT AT CAMP - OR KITSCH - IS JUST TOO THIN
Interesting premise, but the plot is like swiss cheese.  --- This review will just be a point by point of all the major things that I found so implausable that I couldn't just suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride. Spoilers alert.  --- I wasn't able to make the leap to believing Sarah's sudden turn towards malicious opportunism as soon as she saw the cash. When questioned about what she would do if she found some hypothetical millions, she insists with chirpy disinterest that she would certainly turn it in. Just one scene of her looking longingly at a brochure for a holiday she couldn't afford would have established some repressed dissatisfation with her life situation, but her general demeanor seemed to suggest not only comfort, but satisfaction.  --- Why did Hank decide he would burn the money instead of return it if it turned out someone legitimately owned it? Surely it wouldn't be too difficult to anonymously return it without being implicated in it's disappearance. --- The first murder, after the old guy regained consciousness, why did Hank not try to negotiate with or threaten the old guy to keep quiet about his brother assaulting him? For Hank, finishing the job his brother started didn't seem like an absolute last resort, it seemed like he took the murder lightly.  --- When Hank got home apparently he volunteered information to his wife about what he'd just done. What? Like he knew she'd be understanding about it or something? Hi honey, I'm home, by the way I just killed a man to protect the money. Wtf? --- When Jacob shot Lou to protect Hank, why didn't Hank just give the tape back before it got to that point?  --- The shotgun impact on Lou's wife was cartoonishly ridiculous, sending her flying three feet into the air when the blast didn't even hit her at an upward trajectory.  --- And the final ridiculous flaw. Jacob taking the fake FBI agent's gun, and instead of just shooting himself before his brother had time to react, he hands it to his brother, and charges him with the responsibility of killing him, setting up the final emotional crescendo of the film. Supposedly the explanation was that it wouldn't look like the fake FBI agent shot Jacob if the shot was fired at point blank range, but why not? Why couldn't forensic investigators at the scene believe an altercation could have transpired where Jacob charged at the gunman from behind when he was about to shoot the sheriff, wrestled with him, and wound up taking a point blank shot to the head? It really makes no sense.  --- One inspiredly believable moment I will give them film credit for is Hank's difficulty in finding the bullets in the sheriff's office and loading the gun. A lazier writer would have just had him find the gun loaded. --- If the major plot developments were fleshed out in more detail to be made believable this could have been a great film. As it is, it's a frustratingly flaw-ridden glimpse of what could have been and a waste of time to watch. 
I bought this for christmas and i receive it with a large scratch rite on the hard screen where the screen is.  i email back to see if they could do something and they never answer back.  Very rude
Guitar strings have a tendency to break, and buying this 3-pack at a very low cost certainly helps stay 'tuned'.  ---  --- Excellent buy, the product reached me within 4 days, and I have faced no problems yet
I just want to put it out there...Audra McDonald is an absolute genious. Everything she touches turns to gold, and I just want to smack some of you for saying that she failed in her attempt to make a great record. This may not be the audra that we are used to, but if you listen closely she's near by. So this CD is a little less difficult vocally. So what? My favorite quality of Ms. McDonald's is that she is emotionally connected to whatever she is singing. She could record twinkle twinkle little star and I would want to listen to it over and over again because she tells a story. So if you buy this CD, listen to it more than once. Let it grow on you. Let Audra do her thang children. Let her do her thang.
An EXACT copy of Ang Lee's wonderful "Eat Drink Man Woman".  Frankly what annoyed me here was I watched this one first.. I just finished watching Eat Drink.. it took me about 15 minutes to realize I was watching an exact copy of something I'd already seen a couple years ago. Anyway, I was annoyed because while I could predict events in Eat Drink because I'd seen Tortilla Soup, Eat Drink was clearly the better movie -- so unfortunately it spoiled some of the pleasure of Eat Drink for me. If you haven't seen either, see the better of the two (exact same stories): Eat Drink Man Woman
The quality of the DVD's was good. However I did not like the third season as well as the first two seasons. It seemed that the story was setting up for season 4.
Be sure you have a very flat, smooth surface for these bumper cars. There is almost zero clearance between the driving surface and the bumper part of the car. Our girls rode them in our driveway/sidewalk and constantly got stuck on uneven surfaces or the edge of the driveway. We had to make the girls get out and pick up and move the car to a flat surface. These are probably much better for a basement or a perfectly flat surface like a tennis or basketball court. 
I rarely write reviews of music but feel that I must share my impressions of this CD.  I have long heard some of my favorite singers praise the songwriting prowess of Townes but somehow never got around to buying one of his records.  I finally picked this one up because it had two songs that were covered by two of my favorite singers--Lyle Lovett-"Lungs" (among others) and Steve Earle-"Tecumseh Valley".  I was blown away by the sheer beauty and poetry of every song on this recording.  Other reviewers seem to be comparing this to other Townes' records.  I come from a different angle.  As someone who has long heard Townes sopken of with the highest praise, I can say this disk does not disappoint and will influence me to fill out my collection of his recordings.  I will also say that I am deeply frustrated that I never took advantage of the chance to see Townes perform while he was alive. 
Just so everyone knows.  I mean, there are probably only a few troglodites out there who wouldn't be able to figure out or at least guess that this...oh, never mind. ---  --- And don't even bother hitting the "was this review helpful" buttons over this
its a great price but its VERY small. Its unfortunate because it seems well made and folds up nicely but its way too small. There's no way 4 kids can comfortable sit at it.
Happy with price and product.   Very very easy to use; fast and accurate
This play tent is great - my son got it when he was 1 and still loves it a year later.  He brings toys in there and "hides" to play.  It is not unsafe, it will tip over at times, but it's so lightweight that it could not hurt him.  I think that it's a great buy for the money and would recommend it
If you think you are buying the old Met-RX bars by the same flavors, you are in for a very very bad surprise. The old bars had better taste and a almost cake-like consistency. These were so sticky that I could pick up papers just by touching them after eating one.  Also, I couldn't get past the taste. Even the color is different.  ---  --- I never finished the bar and I used to eat one a day (years ago). I gave the entire box away for free. ---  --- I will not buy these again until the go back to their old recipe.
My three girls ages 3 to 7 liked this toy when added to their pretend food collection. We didn't use it as a game. You can place the different frosting and sprinkle combination pieces onto the different colors of donuts to make different varieties. Each would take a turn 'ordering' types of donuts and the others would 'make' them. Yes, the frosting won't stay on if the donut turns over but fits in easily and works great on a plate for pretend play! Box is flimsy but we just keep all the pieces in our general play food bin so not an issue. Would buy this again. Great for kids with imaginations
I upgraded from Photoshop 7 to CS2 and have never looked back.  No problems what so ever and many new features that really make it worth the purchase
get your children to eat a little bit of fiber!! These are really good. Of course their almond and mixed nuts flavors are even better!
I found I did enjoy this movie, even though the director took liberties. It doesn't follow so much the novel by Jane Austen, but if you haven't read the book and are unable to do the comparisons, this movie is enjoyable. I gave 4 stars because of the liberties taken by the director, but did like what I saw
I had been told that these were wonderful, to keep your baby safe while sleeping on his side or back. But my little man slides down to where his face is between the foam sides. This worries me more than if he were to sleep on his stomach
This is a great,simple, fast game that is fun for all ages
Love it.  It's effective especially when it snows a lot.  I like that it's so lightweight, makes other snow brushes seem heavy and clumsy
I discovered my MS Office had a bug in it, and came that way from the factroy.  I looked Word over and it was clean.  Then the program itself.  It does everything and well, and it does it without the tracking bug on it
It is hard when you have an infant to secure them in their car seat with a huge snowsuit on. I found myself dredding going out because my daughter would look like an eskimo in her car seat.  I was delighted when I found the Urban Me Bundle.  I don't have to worry about bundling her up in heavy gear when we go out.  We just put on her hat and go.  The Urban Me Bundle gives your child enough breathing room as well as providing warmth and comfort.  It helps too that it is rain resistant.  I have received many compliments on my Urban Me Bundle and found it to be a wise investment. It really doesn't compare to the other ones that are on the market because you can definitely see the difference in quality of the fabric inside and out
I BOUGHT THIS LIKE A IPOD BUT ITS BETTER I HAVE ABOUT 20 MOVIES ON IT AND ABOUT 500 SONGS AND SOME PHOTO'S AND STILL HAVE 50 GIGS LEFT. THE ONLY HANG UP IS YOU STILL HAVE TO GO PAY ANOTHER 20.00 TO GET THE PLUG-IN DOWNLOAD THAT LETS YOU SHOW MOST OF THE MOVIES. THEY SAY IT CAN DO ALL THIS STUFF BUT NOT WITH OUT DOWNLOADS AND SOME ADD ON'S ONCE YOU GET ALL THAT THERE ARE HOURS OF FUN TO BE HAD.
i bought this knife for my husband for a christmas gift. at first he was thrilled to get a new one. upon putting the knife on his key ring and trying to use it, he noticed that the blade opens toward the key chain, making it almost impossible (and very uncomfortable) to use. He had to buy another knife that opened the opposite way. He did, however, like the other features, namely the light and the pen.
Word space for the other language is not work performed or designed.  --- For english OK! --- work's good
  While it's certainly true that there will always be a gulf between reality and words, communication between reader and writer is nonetheless very real and potentially profound, thanks in no small part to empathy and the imagination. Deconstructionism, by denying presence and instead proposing unlimited differences between signs, dismisses any connection between readers and writers and turns language into a hermetic system separated from the outside world which is, of course, inhabited by people who read and people who write. This is exactly what makes deconstructionism so empty and hypocritical: It rejects traditional metaphysics while adopting a pseudo-mystical position which regards language as some unstable and solipsistic alien creature independent of everything and everyone
If you love Tinkerbell, this steerling wheel cover is a must have!  It was a little difficult to put on, but it looks very tinkish!  I love mine and plan on adding more Tinkerbell stuff to my truck!  Oh and if you plan on taking it off...good luck it's pretty sturdy and is meant to resist sliding...but I LOVE IT!
Very good quality sound, loud ring, substantial weight (not all cheap plastic with no heft).   ---  --- Only con is that even on "low" the ringer is very loud
I thought it was me until I read several other reviews of Predator.  Ms. Cornwell can do so much better than this disjointed mess.  If she's going to continue the Scarpetta series, she needs to get back on track, creating characters that we care about.  I finished this book as quickly as possible just to get it behind me.  What a disappointment
This is a great tennis bag with good space. Fits 3 racquets easily and several separate areas. I love it
The same afternoon I ordered it from Amazon the dealer --- confirmed the order and notified me that it had been  --- shipped.  Can't ask for better service than that. ---  --- It was everything I expected and just what my  --- granddaughter wanted.  I'm not an expert on --- calligraphy but I looked at a lot of sets in stores --- and on line and this seemed to be high quality at --- a reasonable price
I got this monitor along with a keyboard. When I get home I plug my laptop into both and I have a huge screen to do my work on. The colors are terrific, the mouse works seamlessly across the laptop screen and the big auxilliary screen. Wish I had done this a long time ago
 ---       --- THE BAD NEWS FIRST: DOESN'T SEEM TO WORK WELL WITHOUT ADDING EXTRA DETERGENT  ---  --- It seems like this is NOT 3x concentration, and like others we found we had to compensate by adding more detergent than the directions said to get the same results as we did with the standard formula. Otherwise, the two products, 'concentrated' and 'standard srength' are the same.  ---  --- MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT - THIS IS CONCENTRATED & COMES OUT LIKE HEINZ KETCHUP: ---  --- It does seem to be concentrated, and we did notice a certain amount of difficulty getting the detergent out of the bottle, kind of reminded us of Heinz ketchup. ---  --- 4-STAR or 5-STAR PRODUCT?  ---  --- The standard strength product is clearly a 5-STAR product, however owing to the fact that this product does not work as well without adding more detergent than the direction claim, it rates 4-STARs with our family.  ---  ---  --- TRYING TO LEARN OBJECTIVE INFO ON LAUNDRY DETERGENT IS WELL . . . .  ---  --- THE FOLLOWING IS TRUE OF THIS PRODUCT IN STANDARD STRENGTH or 3X WITH EXTRA DETERGENT ADDED:  ---  --- I am allergic to most laundry detergents, but this product has prevented severe discomfort for me for about 10 years. It is consistently among the lowest-priced detergents available. In addition to being very easy on clothes and skin, it does work quite well in the stain-removal department and can be used as its own presoak. This is good to know if you are like me and are trying to avoid allergens. It is important to remember that if you buy a hypoallergenic powder detergent instead of a liquid like this, you may have to pre-soak stains and you won't have a hypoallergenic liquid with which to do it. While "Tide" and "Cheer" are also available in hypoallergenic formulas,["Tide Free" is actually just unscented] they are considerably more expensive and work no better in my experience. That's why I like this "All Liquid Detergent - Free Clear, Laundry Detergent".  ---  --- OBJECTIVE INFORMATION IS TOUGH TO FIND!  ---  --- I actually did conduct a hard target search for true, objective information on laundry detergents. There is very little beyond which brand causes pollution which, while important, is not what I was trying to find. "Consumer Reports" does have test comparisons of the most popular brands in its monthly magazine every couple of years and they do include some detail.  ---  --- ABOUT "ALL'S WEBSITE"  ---  --- If you are looking for this product's website it is under "Unilever" and you will have to specify "USA" under products, as the word "ALL" will show up in almost every search result. You will find "WISK" and "BREYER'S ICE CREAM" and almost as many neat name brand products as you would at Procter and Gamble's site.  ---  --- [I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY] 
The author of the Declaration of Independence and promoter of a bill of rights for the U.S. Constitution, Thomas Jefferson once wrote: "I read no newspaper now but Ritchie's, and in that chiefly the advertisements, for they contain the only truths to be relied on in a newspaper." [Letter to Nathaniel Macon, January 12, 1819] ---  --- The Nation is not a newspaper. Rather it is a weekly compilation of informed opinion and investigative reportage that reports what the main stream press and infotainment TV doesn't dare to. Those Americans whose minds have been addled by a steady stream of ideological propaganda and lies call The Nation "left wing," "liberal," "radical," etc., etc.  ---  --- Plato had written 2,300 years ago his Allegory of the Cave: "Behold! human beings living in an underground den, which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching all along the den; here they have been from their childhood, and have their legs and necks chained so that they cannot move, and can only see before them, being prevented by the chains from turning round their heads." Plato's "punchline" was "...  And if he is compelled to look straight at the light, will he not have a pain in his eyes which will make him turn away to take refuge in the objects of vision which he can see, and which he will conceive to be in reality clearer than the things which are now being shown to him?" ---  --- And so, dear reader The Nation is filled with sunlight that too many Americans cannot stand to look into directly. It is much less painful for them simply to say: "... the Nation's political bias is so far to the Left that it repeatedly errors in its evaluations of the American and world - situation." ---  --- For those who wish to know the simple truth of what is going on in America and the world read The Nation. It prints the patriotic, incisive truth.
Just my two cents, I bought these from the sony store for $15 bucks two years ago, they've lasted me this long for light office use, so at $7/year, this seems to be a good budget earphones.  I'm not an audiophile, so I don't need expensive earphones.  However they did eventually die on me where the cable connects to the jack, the wires got loose and the sound just stopped.  Moral of the story: don't twist or touch the wires/cable. ---  --- Pros:  lightweight, budget-oriented, comfortable fit for my ears --- Cons:  eventually broke, cheap earphone covers will get lost easil
We purchased this for our 5 year old along with the spy goggles.  He immensely enjoyed both.  As a matter of fact, the adults were quite taken with it too
This is a fabulous product.  I use the whole Mustela line.  This is great for sponge bathing when your newborn arrives home.  I also use it on a cotton ball after baths to make sure my baby is extra clean.  This is great for helping babies complexion
I've been a GTA fan for a few years now and to me, San Andreas has got to be the best one. For the first time you can swim!! I fell into the water accidently and discovered this new action for the character. The graphics are more real making it kind of "funky" controlling the game but after awhile you'll get used to it. The language is terrible (more so in this GTA version) so young kids should avoid this like the plague.
I have many traditional film SLRs including the original Pentax K1000 (fully manual), Canon Rebel XOS and a Canon Elph. When considering digital SLR cameras the Canon Digital Rebel and  the point-and-shoot Canon Digital Elph were at the top of my list. But at $150 less than the Canon Digital Elph, the Casio Exilim  EX-S series is a better buy with the the same features (and in some cases a better execution of the same features). If you're looking for a fun point-and-click camera that will record audio, AVI movie files and digital pictures this is it. It takes about 15 miuntes to read the manual and you're off taking pictures. Pay attention when reading the manual and everything else will seem very intuitive. --- Of all the cameras I have I use this one most often.  ---  --- Other users have complained about the proprietary lithium ion battery but 3rd party equivalents are available right here on the amazon site, you just have to look. My back-up battery was only [...] bucks. San Disk 1GB memory cards are cheap too, [...] online, [...] retail. Last, I agree with many users that a lock switch needs to be developed so that you can keep the camera from accidentally turning on when it's in your pocket -- but remember many cameras have this problem/lack/this feature. I solved my own issues by buying a [...] case with a belt loop
I found the product highly unsafe as a stroller. The handle is very flimsy, and is not strong enough to control the direction of the stroller. Also the wheels do not lock properly and safely. Its ok as a car seat but as a stroller has a lot to improve
I needed a bluetooth headset because of all of the driving I do in traffic but I didn't want to look like a dork with some giant blinking contraption sticking out of my ear. I took a chance on this headset even though I read a review saying that it didn't sync up well with the VX8300. I couldn't be more happy. Even though it is small(about 1-1/2") the buttons are still large enough to use with ease. It also fits snug and comfortabe in my ear and works well with my VX8300.
What a great game! My 4 year old loves the disney princess. It is such a great educational toy. We love it
I have been a fan since Valotte. and I like the other reviewers here, can't believe why this cd didn't receive the airplay it deserves!There must have been some politics in there, with Sean's cd coming out on the same day ( Yoko?) It is one of those cds that you just leave on and you don't feel like you have to go and skip over songs that you don't like! I love every song!! Especially "Day after Day"," I should have known", "I don't want to know" and my fav right now "Cold".. I hope that what I have heard is true that he is working on his latest now. Can't wait! Buy this cd.. you won't regret it
This album in some ways is a perfect antithesis of the quirky, wacky, vivid personality of the first three Galactic studio albums--this is boring, flat and generic. Is that Stanton Moore or a drum machine? Precede straight to Garage a Trois
I've been a BW subscriber for 8 years now, and if the magazine stays as good as it currently is, I see at least 60 more years of subscription. ---  --- BW is a very well balanced magazine focusing mainly on business trends and headline news.  A majority of their articles are extremely informative, well written, and objective.  If there is an opinion piece, it is clearly stated as "Commentary".  I enjoy the "Economic Viewpoint" where it alternates between right and left wing economists (Hubbard for Rep., Tyson for Dems).  BW is also forward thinking in writing about trend analysis and disecting what the future may bring.  There is a good snippet of International business.   ---  --- A couple weaknesses of the magazine: --- -Tech & You column.  The guy writes about the same category of gadgets over and over again (mainly PDA & what not).  I would like to see more articles about HDTV, laptops, desktops, software, etc.  Tech & You appears to be written for either a road-warrior or a technophobe. --- -Personal lifestyles section.  Seems like the magazine is catering towards a more upscale crowd, writing about exotic vacations and expensive wines that only either a very rich person or a very debt prone person could afford. ---  --- I also find the magazine to be weak in covering the retail sector.  I'd like to read more full articles about companies average consumers deal with on a weekly basis.  The Kmart/Sears deal was largely overshawdowed. ---  --- All in all, if I could only choose one magazine to receive, this would be the one. ---  ---  ---  --- 
Othello is a difficult production for me to watch at any time. Seeing the horrors of jealousy run amuck to the destruction of innocence is painful at the best of times. In the instance of this production it is even more painful because it is so well done. ---  --- The story of Othello is that of a Venetian general who marries a local daughter of a nobleman. The general happens to be black. In an effort to sabotage the general, Iago undermines the faith of the husband for his wife leading ultimately to the tragedy of her death. While Shakespeare gives motivations for his characters, interpretations and emphases tend to vary. Kenneth Brannagh's production of Othello emphasies Iago as a troublemake who likes to cause trouble simple for the sake of doing so. This production, with Ian McKellan in the role of Iago, puts more emphasis on his desire for revenge in reaction to a perceived slight. Both are accurate portrayals but the former seems to show more delight in "being bad" wheras the latter seems more inclined to "get even". Both are excellent and accurate but the emphasis in this film makes the heaviness of the theme that much more difficult to endure. ---  --- The role of Desdemona is portrayed in this version by Imogen Stubb and she is a delight to watch. She bring an alluring innocence to the role that makes her demise all that much more tragic. So too is the title role played admirably. The problem with Othello is that he is at heart and honorable man but lets his passions rule him and cause him to lash out with devatiging consequence. ---  --- This is a fine performance all around with a difficult play. If you can keep your anger at the antics of the characters in check, it is well worth the time
I have very sensitive skin, a thick beard, and must shave daily.  What a hellacious combination! The Art of Shaving for Sensitive Skin is the best shaving cream I have found...and I have been searching far and wide.  As for the rest of their products...eh, I could take them or leave them...i.e. there are similar products you can acquire much cheaper. --- This shaving cream in particular has no alcohol and all kinds of natural ingredients including a bunch of non-comudegenic (sp?) oils that really protect your skin. 
Too many Christians are ignorant of our rich past.  We know a lot about the 1st Century and the current times, but everything in between is somewhat blank.  Christian History magazine is more than informative; it inspires, challenges and even admonishes in its unique way.  I look forward to each issue.  I doubt I will ever let this expire
Bought a nice grill wanted/needed a cover, works well. A bit ackward but does the job
I love The Tingler! Each metal tip feels great.  I personally like the COPPER version a little better than the SILVER version.  It's a little gentler and softer but I know some people find it too soft and like the SILVER version instead.  Before the tingler, sometimes I would use one end of my glasses (the end that fits over the ear) but of course my glasses are fragil and I would risk damaging them.  It also feels really good on the back and actually all over, not just on the head
    The first shave seemed good; but the second time did me in with the Fusion. Instead of just one nick, I managed around 3 or 4 nicks at once. But looking at the cost of the replacement cartridges put me into a state of price shock.  ---    I got a Merkur Heavy Duty double edge safety razor & the blades are a huge savings. Merkur blades or Feather double edge blades average 50 cents apiece. The Feather blades are extremely sharp! ---    The Gillette Sensor is more practical for me when in a big hurry. A good old fashioned shave using the double edge safety razor, a badger hair shaving brush, & some Proraso shave cream in the tube is alot more enjoyable & relaxing for me!  ---   ---  ---   
The special was filmed in 1970 and reflected the time period--there's a kind of flower power feel to it but it was well done. Doris and Perry Como's duet together was ok (but Perry seemed to not like Doris flirting with him.) Doris Day has always been under-rated as a singer. Her voice is sheer perfection. It's too bad that Doris didn't do more specials or have a variety/comedy/musical show like Carol Burnett.
CorelDraw was my first foray into vector graphics back when version 3 showed up on my desk at the small "Mom and Pop" screenprinting shop i worked at. Back then, Corel came with OODLES of free fonts, clipart, manuals ... not to mention FREE technical support via a toll-free number. ---  --- i stayed with Corel exclusively until version 10 ... enduring countless patches, bugs and the dreaded "odd-numbered" curse (if you tried version 5 or 7, you feel my pain). Adobe Photoshop was always my photo-editing program of choice ... CorelPhotoPAINT just never quite "did it" for me. ---  --- Industry demands eventually delegated that i delve into Adobe Illustrator. Being already familiar with Adobe Photoshop's features, tools and "look and feel", Illustrator didn't present a huge, overbearing learning curve. In Illustrator, i found the same robust features as CorelDraw ... which wasn't what impressed me about Illustrator. Adobe's intuitive programs, and their ability to interact with one another ... seamlessly ... THAT is what won me over to Illustrator. Illustrator's ability to edit/create PDF's in their native format? WOW! Exporting LAYERED vector files to Photoshop ... with layers INTACT??? WOW!!! (i could go on) ---  --- Now, that being said ... there are STILL things that i prefer in CorelDRAW  compared to Illustrator. The EXTRUDE function in corel is MUCH easier to utilize. The PowerClip function is more user friendly than Illustrator's "make clipping mask" function. The ability to customize/edit/add shortcut keys is an amazing feature. (again ... i could go on) ---  --- In regards to importing and exporting files from other applications, CorelDRAW wins, hands down. It boasts a ROBUST set of import and export filters, my favorite being the .eps import filter which lets you import an .eps while converting the fonts to curves DURING the import. This is a MUST HAVE if you work with an .eps file created on another computer whose fonts you lack. If i had a dollar for every .eps that pulls into Illustrator with fonts blown out ... i'd be independently wealthy. WHY Illustrator has never implemented this is beyond me. ---  --- So, to sum it up ... CorelDRAW is a great program ... but i can't imagine it being my ONLY vector drawing program. Just like in real life, you need a great team. This program, paired with Adobe Creative Suite, meets my needs perfectly
My drive FAIL after one year and a half...!!! This company really suck BIG TIME....I lost all of my data ...!!! ALL OFF IT...!!! THIS IS THE THIRD ONE THAT FAIL OUT OF FOUR OF THEM I PURCHASED LAST YEAR!!!  Total JUNK...!!! NEVER buy a LACIE AGAIN FOR SURE....MAXTOR EXTERNAL IS THE BEST!!
I used this for my daughter who always falls alseep in the car and has her head dangling all over the place. It works GREAT! Her head actually stays in the right position and she sleeps better... which is a plus
This pin isn't as pretty in person as it is in the picture online.  It is nice but not spectacular
My child recieved this for Christmas. He Loved it so much. His older brothers have big ones and now he feels like a big boy since he has one too
It is a good universal remote control, I had several but this is the only one that could realy controles my TV wel
i got the largest size they had (size 10) and my toes were crunched in. they fit my mom just barely, and she's a size 8. i wanted to get my money back for it, but it'd probably be more money just to ship the incredibly small slippers back, then it actually costed to begin with.
I was about to retire an old standalone DVD recorder, because it would no longer let me create menus or finalize discs.  I bought this lens cleaner and -- voila! -- the recorder is working again.  Super easy to use (it's simply a DVD that you insert into your machine, and the menus tell you what to do).  Highly recommended
I have searched high and low to find a high-quality sugar free, dairy free chocolate bar that tasted just like the real thing, and I can honestly say that these amazing chocolate bars fit the bill perfectly!  Ross Chocolates has truly done it--I could not tell the difference between these and the kind made with sugar and dairy.  These dark chocolate bars are perfect for anyone looking for a pure, healthy alternative to the standard sugar-laden chocolate bar out there.  I am hypoglycemic, so normal sugary candy isn't an option for me.  These bars, though, have no impact on my blood sugar--in fact, I feel even better after eating them and have no negative reactions whatsoever!  They are also perfect for people who are allergic to dairy (like myself) because they are completely dairy-free.  As an added bonus, each bar contains 3 grams of fiber!  The bars have a wonderul, fresh crunch to them, with none of the strange aftertaste common to some products sweetened with sugar alcohols.  I honestly couldn't tell the difference between these maltitol-sweetened bars and those sweetened by regular sugar.  Enjoy
It is not the Wonderful Twinings Earl Grey you have come to know and love.  They have pulled a "new coke" blunder and now the best Earl Grey tea ever is available no more!  This tea is weak and tasteless. --- I hate stupidity, especially from corporate marketers
This conditioner leaves hair ultra-soft and doesn't weigh it down. If you have trouble with conditioners leaving a strong residue on your hair, this one won't. ---  --- The ingredients contain rosemary infusion, lavender flower infusion, seaweed and fresh lemon juice. The lemon is great for washing the hair clean of residue. It's a great conditioner
You have a spilt second to get the wipey out and then it gets cold. Not to mention the warm moist environment is a breeding ground for bacteria, especially if you are wiping, then put your hands back in to get another wipey
This is a thick attractive doormat.    It's also quite heavy & hasn't budged in inch in high winds.    I'm very pleased with the purchase
Unfortunately, this book is the sign of what passes for humour these days. Even though it may have been remotely funny (sometimes the author comes close to being bearable), the book never actually tries to be.  ---  --- Humour is supposed to be smart. However, this book gives us the worst case of dumb
Yeah, it's a money clip alright.  Going from an overfilled wallet down to a 5 card/cash only clip was surprisingly easy.  I found that I was carrying a whole lot of "stuff" in my wallet that I didn't need and was just causing my wallet to get bigger and bigger. ---  --- With just 5 cards, a couple receipts and a little cash this clip is much more comfortable, easier to manage, and looks a lot better than my old wallet. ---  --- I do agree with the previous reviewer about the clip forcing the cash to bunch up under the clasp when it's closed.  However, it doesn't take long for it to become second nature to keep the cash pulled out a bit before securing it down. ---  --- I haven't used any other money clips so I can't compare this one to others, but if you use a wallet I can say that this is, hands down, my new preference
Without getting too much into it this Album is pretty good. 4 stars for some bad ass tracks. My favs are Tears from the moon, Beautiful things , As the rush comes. All in all worth the money
This review isn't really about the flip-flops, because theyre great. Why would you buy them here for $5.61 when you can get them at the store for $2.50 each?
This book is truly lovely--about finding friendship in the most unexpected of places. I cannot imagine anyone not enjoying it immensely (and you won't get tired of reading it to your kids either)
You won't find a better headset to reproduce top quality music in any format.  And, the price is right, from competent sellers. 
I was just surfing the shelves at Borders today when I stumbled over Queen Kelly on DVD!  I couldn't believe it. I have just been getting interested in silent films (I'm 18) and of course I'm a Gloria Swanson fan (who isn't?), having seen her brilliant performance in Sunset Blvd. Anyway, I had always heard rumors about Queen Kelly - the incomplete, forgotten masterpiece. I had to pay a whopping [money] for this DVD, but it is definitely a piece of art and worth every penny.    First of all, this film is old. You can hear it creak and moan at times and the orchestra soundtrack has not aged well - let's just say the music is annoyingly intense. But the age of the film just makes it more haunting to watch. The story takes place in the 20s, but you could almost believe it was hundreds of years ago.    Now I want to concentrate on the story and the performances. Gloria Swanson's performance in Queen Kelly has to be one of her best - she was every bit as good in this film as in Sunset Blvd. We can easily see why she was such a huge silent star - her emotions and beauty carry the film just as much as the fascinating story.     This was really melodrama at its best. People tend to forget, I think, that melodrama can be an art form, stressing wistful idealism and instead of cynical realism!  The main event here is the story - wow! It's tragic that the film (and the story) were never finished. But who knows? It's just begging for a megabucks remake with Nicole Kidman. Now that the musicals are back, maybe silents will be next
I ordered this from amazon, it shipped from 3btech.... and ive had no luck with it... the communicator its self is quite comfortable... but i cannot comment on the quality of the mic or the audio that comes through it because it will not charge... i called logitech tech support and the tech asked me the usual questions (is it plugged in, have you tried a different wall outlet, have you tried jiggling the plug at the communicator end, and so on) after all the questions the tech said that it was defective and that they were running dangerously low on stock of that particular one.    ---  --- So i guess what im trying to say is order at ur own risk and i hope you have better luck with it than i did
I've had this digital camera for almost a year. It's the fourth camera I've owned. I spent quite some time searching for a compact camera that I could carry everywhere. Being an amateur photographer (and mostly taking pictures for myself and not others), I didn't want to lug around an extra bag just for my camera. It fits discreetly in your pocket or a small purse (for formal nights out). The size and weight of this camera is its best feature, and this carries through to the newer generations of this camera, too.  ---  --- This has been the perfect camera for everything from selling items on-line to landscape scenery. My pictures have always turned out beautifully, with wonderful color and crispness. I have discovered that the "automatic" lighting feature is not always the most ideal, but you can re-program just about anything on this camera.   ---  --- It's really quite a good camera, and given its price these days with the newer generations out there, it's a steal
It was larger than I expected from the images, thicker too. In my opinion it didn't look as classy as the picture made me believe. ---  --- I was very disappointed that the regular second hand was NOT in fact the large sweeping thin hand, that's actually only for the stop watch. The regular second hand is one of the gimmicky minature dials in the middle. ---  --- Really, with the extra bulk and my dislike of which hands were which, and the cheaper look of the watch in person, I never actually put it on before sending it back
It works really well.  It's stable (the little guy is trying to climb) and holds a lot
This camisole did not fit my purpose. The idea is great, but it didn't fit me correctl
I bought this camera around the beginning of July and have used it several times already.  I've upgrade from a Nikon Coolpix 3200 to this one due to smaller, sleaker size and more megapixels.  This camera takes excellent pictures, in broad daylight as well as in the dark.  Red eye reduction is wonderful, however the flash does go off about 4 or 5 times.  It's not broken... it's supposed to do that for everybody who thinks their camera has a glitch.  Overall, I think this was definitely a good buy and am looking forward to taking the camera on vacation! 
I have been reading about this miracle hair dryer for months in the beauty magazines I read, so I will admit I was very excited to pruchase it. The results however will amaze even the most cynical consumer. My hair has never looked so good when styled at home. True, it looks about the same as what my hairstylist does, but to me that is well worth the moderately high price tag. It was a good buy for me because I spend a lot of money buying a variety of cremes and glosses to make my hair pretty, and now I know it wasn't the products I put in that made my hair look bad, it was the dryer.I was so surprised to notice that even the ends of my hair were shiny, and my ends are sooo fried. The difference is astounding.  ---  --- I bought this dryer in a package with the babyliss straightener, and I would definately recommend that to anyone wanting to buy this dryer. For the same price you can get a free straightener. (A very good one!)

For the most part, these people whom the author thought are prominent Jews are either ignoramuses  as regards to Judaism and our heritage (especially the 2 Supreme Court Justices, who probably never heard of the concept of tzeddek) or are not even Jewish at all. A waste of time
The device shows a lot of info like it should.  Nice design and accurate as well. It's just as good if not better than the television weather forecast and current conditions. The only thing I would improve upon is the readability of the face of the instrument. It has to be read from directly in front or it is not clear enough. 
..of little teenage white girls trying to sound like thirty-year-old black women.  First it was Britney Spears, then it was Christina Aguilera, now it's Joss Stone.  The former at least have something going for them; Britney's first album had catchy beats, and even though Aguilera's style is incredibly trashy, she does have enormous vocal power and range if she would only stop trying so hard. ---  --- Try as I might, though, I just don't understand the appeal of Joss Stone.  I didn't buy this album; a friend of mine likes it and I've had to listen to it enough times to want to rip my ears right out of my head.  I don't see what is fresh or original about ripping off Janis Joplin and the generally much more talented black soul singers.  Maybe it's the Rick Astley effect: you don't expect THAT voice coming out of THAT face.  You don't expect a squinty little teenaged blonde to growl and screech like a deranged cat.  But that effect can only take you so far, as Rick Astley himself found out.  ---  --- This album is not only an unpleasant listening experience because of the stupid songs ("Dirty Man" basically just repeats "You're a dirty man..." with very minor variations, along with a great deal of unnecessary caterwauling) and the nails-down-a-chalkboard voice of Stone herself - it's a depressing reminder of how low our culture has sunk, when it can't come up with any culture based on its own heritage but slavishly copycats things from another culture that seems more "cool".  Stone, like Aguilera and Spears, tries to sing like an older black woman, a woman with soul - an Aretha Franklin or a Gloria Gaynor.  But Stone et al. sound like little girls clattering around in grown-up shoes.  They haven't been alive long enough to live similar experiences of the women they are trying to imitate.  Their singing rings hollow to me, show-offy and fake. ---  --- Stone could rival Aguilera in shameless and unnecessary vocal theatrics, though she has nowhere near Aguilera's sweetness or range.  Her voice might be described as "smoky" by some; to me it sounds gravelly, sandpapery, and as pleasant as scraping your knees on asphalt. ---  ---  I don't understand why anyone in the right mind would willingly put themselves through the ordeal of listening to this CD, much less enjoy it.  I guess fake is good enough for some people.  It makes me chuckle, though, to hear people rave about her voice as "authentic".    ---  --- If you're looking for soul, try Macy Gray.  She's for real.  Try the hugely talented but woefully ignored Tasmin Archer and Karen Rodriguez.  Those are fresh, authentic voices that will make you realize what a load of bollocks Joss Stone and her ilk truly are. ---  --- The only white woman I have ever heard who could sing like she was black was Linda Ronstadt.  Go back and listen to a Ronstadt classic like "Hurts So Bad" and compare it to this modern-day drivel.  Ronstadt sang with real feeling, real knowledge, real pain - worlds apart from this fake plastic imitation of soul that seems to be the rule and not the exception these days.   ---  --- I gave this one star because there is no zero-stars option.  Joss Stone is just a musical Chav, an unconvincing shoplifter of another, better culture
Most reviewers on this site are unenthusiastic about this particular product.  I think the main reason for that level of dissatisfaction is, as someone else suggested, that people need to pay attention to how, exactly, this trimmer works.  Because of its design, best results are obtained when it is inserted, withdrawn, then inserted again, and the procedure repeated.  Second tip: rinse the rotating blade, switched ON, under the HOT tap to remove accumulated hair, etc, after each use.  It works better when clean. ---  --- The main PLUS of this product is its size.  Yes, it is flimsy, made in China, and would probably sell for $2.50 if it didn't say Panasonic on it - or come with a 12-month Panasonic warranty.  But it works very well if you use it right and keep it clean. I have had mine a couple of years and the only problem is that the blade is now dull and replacement blades are apparently not available
I have two iPods that don't work.  I bought a shuffle first and that has an error that I can't fix and Apple can't fix.  So, I thought I'd buy 1GB iPod a year later and that broke down even with a new computer.  So, this time I made the right decision and bought the 30 GB Zune.  Wow!  The Zune is so much better!  It has such a better feel to it and the controls react nicely, instead of making you frustrated like the iPod.  The screen is perfect.  Sound quality is excellent.  5 Stars for the Zune. 
I purchased this as a gift for my secret santa, and she wore it a week strait
The Schwinn Airdyne is built to last out of steel. For upper and lower body workout, it uses a fan/flywheel to create resistance rather than a friction belt or magnetic motor; hint--fewer repairs and failures since there is no friction mechanism to fail. ---  --- The onboard computer allows your to select what information you wish to see such as mets, calories, distance, speed, rpm and even displays your pulse if you wear a chest strap.  You can select miles or kilometers for distance and "club or home" for setup; hint--built to withstand use in a fitness center/health club. It even allows you to imput your geological elevation to facilitate a more accurate calorie count. ---  --- Assembly is straight foward but does require a few basic tools such an adjustable wrench and phillips screwdriver. ---  --- This represents a good way to go if you want a well built durable piece of equipment intended for serious use to achieve your goal of cardio-vascular conditioning, weight loss or just plain old exercise
     After purchasing many dog training manuals and finding them not quite up to snuff, I was very pleased to finally find a book which was comprehensive and authoritative. It breaks each area of the sport down and is easy to follow.  The book is intelligently written
This SW is fantastic.  Having the on-line access made this product perfect, without ionline access this product would only be a storage device for family history that you already know.  I was able to get info on my family back to the 1800's in a matter of days since other relatives did all the research (relatives I don't even know).
I love the texture of the coffee.  There is no bitterness and it is very smooth - to where I didn't need cream to cut the flavor.  I am usually not a coffee drinker but a friend told me that this is one of the best she ever had.  This was intended to be a christmas gift for her but out of curiosity I bought one for myself to include with the  7 bags for her.  I now know the difference!  Believe me, I had thought that instant tasted way better then "real" coffee until a I had a cup of this java.  I was almost tempted not to give the rest of the coffee away. ---  --- Also, the shipment was very fast!  I had ordered this with other items (books and DVDs).  The coffee came in within the week but the other items didn't come in at all.  Infact every time I checked the progress, amazon kept pushing the items further away in the shipment date.  I couldn't understand this at all!  I had to cancel the rest of the order and buy the items elsewhere.  Go figure
I needed a nice bench for the entry but didn't want to settle for the same old bench like everyone else has so I stumbled upon this one and I love it!!!! It's well made and the cushion is very plush! The colors are perfect! Love it! If you are looking for a nice and classy bench, this is it
I got talked into buying this at the Fresh boutique in Las Vegas.  First, it's very expensive - $38, forgivable if it were outstanding.  It's not even good.  The wand isn't well made, and the product does clump on it, and then it clumps eyelashes rather than lengthen them.  I have tried all week to make this purchase work out for the best, but to no avail.  The worst part is, at the end of the day if I happen to rub my eyes, it smears - racoon eyes.  I've been using Physicians formula and Revlon with the primer both are exponentially better, and I could have purchased eight of them for the cost of Supernova.  On the positive side, it washes off easily and completely with soap and water.
Adobe has totally re-done the interface to streamline it and make it cleaner from versions prior to CS.  If you are a QuarkXpress user, you'll find that in InDesign CS2, you get the feeling that it is laid out in a logical and easy-to-use manner.  The tools and tool palettes are where you'd expect them to be in the menu structure and on the screen.  Small touches like being able to save your workspace, like you can do in Photoshop CS2, are great. ---  --- I tested the integration between InDesign CS2 and some of its counterparts in the Adobe Creative Suite Premium.  I created different graphics in Photoshop CS2 and Illustrator CS2 and I found it was really easy to import them into InDesign CS2 and use.  You can effects like drop shadows and feathering to images directly in InDesign CS2.  No need to go to another program.  With the Control Palette you can also resize objects too.  This palette functions with Transform and Stroke features for graphics, and it includes paragraph, character and table features for text editing.  What the palette does is affected by the type of selection you have made - either graphic or text.  ---  --- I imported some formatted text in from Microsoft Word 2003 and two different tables in from Microsoft Excel 2003.  I was concerned how the tables would appear after the import from Microsoft Excel.  The tables imported easily. With InDesign CS2, you can now automatically style Microsoft Word files on import by mapping Word styles to InDesign CS2 styles as well. ---  --- An issue for a long time has been how to preview or view other types of files that you want to incorporate with InDesign CS2.  Now, Adobe "bridges" that gap.  Bridge now comes as a part of InDesign CS2 and the Premium Suite.  So, viewing any Adobe-type formatted file or standard graphic format is easy to do.  Using the same interface between the different programs is a help as well.  Adobe Bridge is a standalone program. ---  --- Being a Web Designer and using Adobe (formerly Macromedia) Dreamweaver 8, I was familiar with using Snippets.  These are portions of code you can save for use in other programs or you can export them to give to someone else.  Now,  InDesign CS2 offers this Snippet capability.  You can export objects as snippets. These objects can be shared or reused in other documents. Simply place or drag a snippet into a layout, and  InDesign re-creates the original objects, their formatting, and their relative positioning on the page.  No more wasted time redesigning, just to get something you have brought in from another document to fit. ---  --- InDesign CS2 also now has an Info palette that is just like those found in Photoshop and Illustrator.  Size dimensions and resolution are immediately available by selecting the graphic and simply glancing over to the Info palette.  This is a crucial tool when fitting graphics in a specifically space-limited area.  It's important to know the actual dimensions with which you are working. ---  --- Sometimes in designing and re-designing printed work, you have to move objects.  When this happens, your structure can often change in different ways.  InDesign CS2 helps you maintain your layout by allowing you to anchor your callouts, pull quotes, margin notes, and graphics to text. You can now precisely control the positioning of Anchored Objects, apply text wrap settings, and more. ---  --- As with other Adobe products, it is very easy to export your finished work in PDF format.  InDesign CS2 works so well at exporting to PDF, it even maintains the layers in Acrobat 7.  You can pre-define your Acrobat export settings as well.  InDesign CS2 also supports specialty PDF formats like PDF/X-1a and PDF/X-3, which are used in workflows.  It also supports high-resolution CMYK output and color-managed workflows. ---  --- If you are familiar with previous versions of InDesign, the upgrade to the new version is easy.  InDesign CS2 is even backwards compatible CS.  You will find that your learning curve is greatly decreased. ---  --- Loren Elks, Group Manager --- D-MAG.or
I bought this for my son's fourth birthday because he's a superhero nut. It's a cute toy except for one critical flaw: it doesn't come anywhere near fitting around the waist of my average-sized 4-year-old (wears a size 4T). I'm talking about three inches of waist gap on even the smallest setting. Yet the belt can be adjusted to a size that would fit a teenager. If you have a 9-year-old who loves running around in a Batman costume, go for it. As for my 4-year-old, he still plays with it sometimes, but we keep it on him with a pair of firefighter's suspenders. ---  --- Update: The thick plastic of the belt is now ripped halfway apart. We've only had it two months, and he's hardly played with it for the abovementioned reasons. Not so great for Batman, but perfect for playing Super Chintzy Toy Man
The Sundays come out with a CD once a decade, thus putting me in constant cravings for new material. Though Camera Obscura is very original and very much their own band, they satisfy the cravings that only Harriet Wheeler could touch. Truly vast and intimate at the same time, and a voice that speaks to something very deep, sad and lovely inside you
Belushi's crowning jewel perfomance in my opinion is when he played opposite Monty Python's Michael Palin as the MANLY  Captain Ned in the Miles Cowperthwaite skits. They are both absent from this DVD nor on any SNL video I can find.
***** --- I liked this film a lot.  It was entertaining, suspenseful, and made me think.  It's staying with me and I'm continuing to think about it.   ---  --- "A Simple Plan" asks the question, "What if you found $4.4 million in a gym bag in the woods...would you keep it...what if you thought there was a reasonably good chance you'd never get caught...that no one would ever know?"  This is what happens to the central characters.  The DVD cover advertises, "Sometimes good people do evil things."  Once they make their decision, and plan their plan, the movie illustrates how consequences happen that are completely unanticipated.   ---  --- Bill Paxton plays the main character and is wonderful as a typical "good" middle-class accountant in a small rural town.  Bridget Fonda does an excellent job as his wife, who is very idealistic and moralistic until she realizes that the scenario is not hypothetical---in fact, she has to decide what to do, and she makes decisions different from what I would have expected.  Billy Bob Thornton is predictably great, of course, playing a rural man (the main character's brother) who has never had a chance in the town he lives in and just wants to truly have a life, and in his own way, do what is right; he is handicapped, however, by his intelligence, his eccentricity, and his background.  I felt a lot of sympathy for his character, and since I'm a person more like his brother, it was fascinating to see how he lived and thought...as the movie progressed, his middle-class brother gained empathy for the difficult life he led, too.   ---  --- I didn't think that any of the pacing was slow, as other reviewers have said.  I thought that the starkness and the pacing fit in beautifully with the movie and it gave me a chance to process what was going on.  One moral decision led to another, and each of them made me think "Would I do that?" and "Could I do that?"  It made me see how seductive certain crimes in certain circumstances can be to any one of us. ---  --- This is a quality, very suspenseful, provocative film.  I think it would be equally enjoyable for men and women but definitely not for children at all, as the themes are very heavy and mature.   ---  --- There are no special features or subtitles.  I generally like subtitles, but they are not necessary in this film for hearing people, as everyone speaks very clearly.   ---  --- I cannot imagine how anyone would dislike this movie.  There is some violence, but none of it is gratuitous.  I generally really dislike violence in movies, but it was worth it for the experience I took away after watching it. --- ***** 
My son is 5yrs old and this was one of the 1st things on his christmas list. He loves Power Rangers of all kinds but when we finally opened this and I tried to put it together...I thought I was doing it wrong b/c nothing fit or stayed together!! My son still played with the dragon part that was already put together but the storage bin is useless and the rope that the Power Ranger can "slide" down is barely high enough that he stays off of the ground and he pretty much falls down rather than sliding down. The so called "instructions" were horrible and another reviewer was correct in indicating how small the pictures were. I would have never wasted my money on this if I would have read the reviews 1st (I usually do). My son played with it for about 5-10 minutes and then asked why santa would bring him something like that. In my opinion it was a huge waste of about $50 and gave santa a bad name with my son for bringing him such a piece of junk
 The military courtroom drama,"A Few Good Men" is one of those films, that through endless cable showings seems to have taken a life of it's own. But even with countless viewings it retains it's emotional power and speaks to us about issues, that have become more important than ever. In the film we meet Lt. Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise) a young successful, military lawyer, who is considered so slick at plea bargaining out cases, that supposably he's "never even seen the inside of a courtroom". He is assigned the cases of PFC Louden Downey (James Marshall) and Lance Cpl. Harold Dawson (Wolgang Bodison). They are accused of murder and a host of other charges, when at the Guantanamo Bay military base they performed a "Code Red" (an illegal form of discipline within a military unit) on Pvt. William Sandiago, which unintentionally resulted in his death. While the two accused Marines admit they did the "Code Red", both claim they were under orders to do so by their superiors, which includes Base Commander, Col. Nathan Jessup (a brillaint Jack Nicholson) a powerful, highly decorated officer, who is being groomed for one of the top slots in the military command. With both time running out and a lack of legal evidence, Kaffee must get to the bottom of a conspiracy and present his case, even if it means putting his own career in jeopardy. Through a brilliant script (based on the play by Aaron Sorkin), Rob Reiner's steady direction and the cast's dynamic performances this film looks at the meaning of highly held military principles such as "code, honor & discipline". Should a soldier always follow orders no matter what? Whats' more important our ethics & principles (on which this country was founded) or our need for security? Is Col. Jessup right? Can we not "handle the truth"? It's hard to believe, that this film was made way back in 1992. In this post 9/11, post Abu Grebbe world, where our country is on a war footing the questions, that the film seeks to address have become more profound and important than ever. The film is filled with great performances. While I am not normally a huge Tom Cruise fan, I have to admit, that Cruise does a wonderful job as the young conflicted lawyer. The same goes for the great supporting cast which includes good acting turns from Demi Moore, Kevin Bacon and Kiefer Sutherland. But what really propels and turns this film into a classic is the brilliant, dynamic performance, that comes from Jack  Nicholson. When Cruise puts Nicholson on the courtroom stand and starts pointly egging him on, you just watch in awe as Nicholson just continually builds the character's palpable anger, until he just boils over and explodes in the now infamous "You Can't Handle the Truth" speech. Even though the speech and Nicholson's performance has been endlessly quoated & parodied, when you put it in the context of this movie it still has so much power and resonance. If you are interested in seeing a well made, movie courtroom drama, that is both thought provoking and entertaining then I highly recommend "A Few Good Men"
I found Turbotax easy to use.  It gave me the flexibility of filling in individual forms rather than using the interview process.  Since I am an experienced tax preparer, I found this feature welcome
I am a huge fan of most of the Tasty Bite meals. I'd tried almost all of the Indian flavors and had never been let down. I ordered the Green Curry meal without ever having tried it before based on the good reviews here and my past experiance. Unfortuantly, I found it to be nearly inedible. The rice is clumpy and unpleasant and the spicing was just... wrong. I love Thai Green Curry, and this tasted nothing like it. I still recommend the Indian Tasy Bite Meals, but track a box of this down and sample it before you commit to a pack of 6.
I like the flip case. It is exactly what i wanted. However,the clip has fallen off a few times when i hit it.
Don't bother, it doesn't fit at all!!!!!!  Plain and simple...just don't bother
this comedy, like Click has a funny side to it and then switches to a darker side half way through. the characters in this film can be hated at points, especially Michael Douglas' and Matt Dillon's but there is a lighter side! Owen Wilson is very likeable as Dupree, an unemployed party guy who is in need of love and a good paying job. the cast is fine and one of the strength's in this film! however, I think it gets too serious at points. this is supposed to be a comedy after all. I wouldn't buy it but it is certainly worth renting
I am very pleased with the pretty shades of the pearls and the size was even bigger than I expected.  The only thing that would have them even better was bigger flat backings.  I have very small ear lobes so they flopped forward.  I remedied that by changing the backings.  I am wearing them with so many things and really enjoying them
I have longed for gold hoop earrings for years.  These seemed liked they were the ones!  But I waited a while, still debating..... finally 'went for it' and got a pair. I haven't regretted it at all.  I find these earrings comfortable, and I like the way they look on me.  I am very happy with these and recommend these beauties!..... Now, if they would make them in white gold..........
This is a really delicious, natural alternative to other frosted flake types of cereal, and you cannot beat the Amazon price
I was not sure what to expect upon receiving a box of this tea as a gift during the holiday season, and indeed the ingredients struck me as rather unusual.  Being a person who generally likes my tea and coffee black with no flavoring whatsoever, I was rather suspicious of the orange, grapefruit, and other extra 'scents'.  However, I was delighted with the concoction.  The extras are definately present, giving a slightly citric quality to the tea but are not the least bit overpowering and provide a unique  aroma that is quite pleasing.   ---  --- I do recommend steeping it for a long time to get the most out of the leaves, especially if you are to get the citric scents that make it so unique. 
looks very nice, material is not bad..just a little big from my original siz
I saw these here and ordered two pair to get the free shipping deal.  I should get a deal where I get a cut of the customers I send them because EVERY day I have my customers (several each day) ask me what's going on with my glasses and where did I get them. ---  --- I used to go through several pair of reading glasses a month.  Now I have had these two pair for ...gosh, It's got to be close to a year now!  They don't scratch, break, get lost, they're always right there.  I don't know how I did with out them for so long. ---  --- Get a couple of pairs you'll love them.  Oh, one thing when the ladies try them on thier hair doesn't always set right with the wrap around thingy.  But I don't know that this can't be overcome....so...something to consider
The content gives you 40 years of comic reading for a fraction of the price. However, some of the years can't be opened. Tried contacting the seller but to no avail. :
These boots look good with jeans. Can be loose, but comfortable with thick socks
It is almost ashame that North Amercian culture needs Bill Maher. ---  --- After all, shouldn't honest yet entertaining social commentary be a little bit more available then it currently is? On Victory Begins At Home, Maher creates entertainment by basically speaking his mind. ---  --- Maher's central premise that the War On Terrorism can be aided by what people do in the United States really is almost a common sense arguement. Yet Maher is so uniquely unapologetic about what he says and how he presents it, the commentary and comedy bristle with an energy that few comedians can match.  ---  --- Maher does this by not pretending he isn't politically opinated, in fact that is what bases his comedy completely on, the rarity of straight-forward unabashed opinion. ---  --- On Victory Begins At Home he is more Democrat then Republican, but he openly sides with neither. Instead, he rails at all presenting himself as a full person, neither liberal nor conservative, right-wing or left-wing. ---  --- The end result is an engaging and unique look at culture that seems unfiltered. There is no spin here, what Maher realizes is that no spin is funny in a world full of it. With all the spin that is normally doled out by the news media, political columnists and special interest groups, know wonder we need him so much. ---  ---  --- 
I use Print Works CD/DVD envelopes and was worried when I ordered this product that the envelopes wouldn't fit top-up which is important for me because I label the tops of my envelops to make looking through them easier. The envelopes are just a hair over 5" wide and they fit into these storage boxes perfectly. There is just enough room on either side to make flipping through the dvds easy. I ordered four of these and am glad I did. I keep them on a shelf side-by-seide and the make a perfect card-catalog-type filing systemfor all my dvds. I will most definately be ordering up more of these when I need more room; these boxes are great. If you use a 5" wide envelope, rest assured that these boxes are just the right size to fit all your dvds.
I received this highchair as a hand-me-down.  Looks lovely, mine is  pale blue and lime green, but is infuriating to clean.  I have never seen more cracks, crevices, screw holes, all where baby food and slobber collect. After one feeding with my hyper 7 month-old the chair is beyond filthy. You will need to buy toothpicks to get in all the crevices.  A friend of mine has a Fisher-Price high chair which is much less complicated and easier to clean.  The price is insane (glad mine was free).  I would never buy this chair even as a gift. I would advise anyone considering this chair to go with something cheaper and easier to clean. I would give it zero stars if I could
i have been buying Stoneridge Orchards products for a long time, so i decided to try the variety pack for quick snacks. not only the product seems inferior to their regular packages, but also, the pouches were half open in the box. what a rip of
The taste of Maruchan Roast Chicken Flavor Ramen Noodle Soup (3 oz) is not chicken, my friends. Oh no. It is the taste of Death itself. ---  --- Recommend
It's a good looking card holder that matches my desk. For the price it's worth it
How can ANYONE say this chick has talent?!!! My God, she is sooooooooo bad. And yes, I actually listened to it. The only reason it sounds semi ok is because she's got millions backing her and that much technology could even make me sound good! She doesn't write any of her songs and she can't hold a tune. Gives Celine a run for her money? Please!!!! The only singer she sounds better than is Paris Hilton! But whatever. If you like it, that's all that matters. If you like pretty young pop stars, Christina Aguilera is MUCH better. She can actually SING!!
The literature describes this unit as a flat-mount ski rack compatible with any factory-installed roof rack with crossbars.  Hardly. ---  --- My vehicle is a 2006 GMC Envoy with a factory roof rack.  This rack is the same one used on many GM SUVs, so great numbers of them are out there.  These racks have crossbars with a "reverse wing" shape that are tilted forward, presumably to reduce wind noise.  The Thule "universal" mounting system will not conform to these crossbars, and will only mount with the ski rack tilting forward (or backward) at a silly angle.  It can be used in this conformation, but it looks odd. ---  --- Also, the ski rack indeed locks over the skis/boards, but the mounts are not lock-protected, so the entire ski rack and contents can be easily stolen with standard wrenches. ---  --- My searches found no alternative to this rack, however, and it does work for the intended purpose
There is a place for everything in this drying station. I use wide mouth bottles and it's a little tight on space, but it works great for me. It's convenient on the counter when I have to grab a bottle for the baby.
This item is too difficult for a six year old even though advertised as for 5-8 year olds.  You cannot return the item once opened, so do not order
I am a beginning guitar student and I have no idea how to tune a guitar.  This little, easy to carry, easy to use device is invaluable.  It's auto function is amazing, just play the note and it will automatically recognize what you're trying to do.  For someone like me who doesn't want to spend valuable practice time reading manuals for their tuner this is the perfect device.  The built in mic works perfectly.  Can't beat the price
This battery is as good as they say it is. I have not ran out of power yet. 
Intermezzo is, without question, my very favorite magazine. I think it's the best magazine on the market; most beautiful, most interesting, and has the best recipes. Have already made several recipes from the new issue and they are phenomenal, and pretty simple too. Particularly loved the pear nectar punch which I served at my Christmas party, as well as the saffron chicken which I have already made 3 times. I used to alternate subscribing to Bon Appetit and Gourmet but have let those lapse. Have given it as a gift to several friends who love it as well. Any time I have had a change of address or customer service question, I have been pleased and astonished with the personal and prompt attention of the staff, even once the publisher heself. I think Intermezzo is a small company putting out a world class publication. I do wish it came out more often though as I would love to see more of it.
This magazine single-handedly taught me how to dress with style- and believe me- that's no small feat. I love how Lucky shows  how to put pieces together to look fabulous without mindlessly following the crowd. If that's all I had interest in, then I could've simply bought the Lucky shopping guide book.  But their reviews of up and coming clothing and jewelry designers, hair, makeup, home decor, and the "How I'm Wired" sections keep me coming back to the magazine.  Plus the Lucky Breaks are awesome.  My only complaint is the average price of their featured raved-about items.  What Lucky is for me is a fantastic template for fashion and style that I can use to find similar items at cheaper prices in stores like H&M, Target, etc.  It's so worth the $12/year, and I look anxiously at the beginning of each month for its arrival in my mailbox
This sunscreen has the important components to give you UVA and UVB protection.  It goes on smooth for a sunscreen that uses Titanum Dioxide for  its protection agent.  My kids love that the bottle turns color when UVA rays touch it, indicating that sunscreen is necessary
I had to do a bit of research to figure out which would be best (not having much experience in this area) and was very happy I did!  This mic comes pretty highly rated on all pod casting sites for the price and (after using it with Dragon Naturally Speaking 9), I can see why.  I use it to do term papers and it is great!  It is an excellent mic with very solid construction.  Only negative thing (although very minor) I wish I had know that I could have gotten a standard mic stand for it instead of the "fancy" "spider" or "cage" design advertised with it (you really don't need that).  Lastly, no worries with the usb/windows set up.  Literally took it out of the package, plug in and go!  Again a great item
The system requirements for this product on their packaging says nothing about Mac support and requires Windows.  H&R Block didn't support Mac's last year and they've only given half-hearted support this year.  If you own a Mac then TurboTax is your best bet. 
I agree that the water holder is a bit tedious to fill and measure acurately. I always follow the measuring instructions, but sometimes the bottle is too cool or too hot, even though I have been practicing to get it right. I wish it were more accurate and for someone like me, who only has a 3 room apartment, the cooling feature is not that useful
We use these pods for a youth group fundraiser at our church.  We consistently get comments on how great the coffee tastes.  I like how easy they are to use.  No mess, no tamping.  I am able to make drink after drink quickly and easily
I have been a long-time radiohead fan and, like many others, have been waiting patiently for a live DVD.  So I was thrilled to find out they released one and immediately bought it without even looking at the setlist.  It never occurred to me that they would release material that is nearly 10 years old!   ---  --- I couldn't help being disappointed when I watched this DVD.  The constantly changing camera angles and general lack of concern for the song itself make this unpleasant to watch.  In fact, I only watched it once and it has since been gathering dust.  I know I would have enjoyed it much more had it come out when the songs were still in their prime.   ---  --- I've always that Radiohead was modern, progressive, and totally innovative.   I appreciate their old music but they have come a long way since pablo honey... and it doesn't help that before every song, Thom mutters "this is a new one." 
I got it on sale for $88.00 thinking it would be a great bargain at that price. I feel I was ripped off. The video quality is ghastly when given enough light, and absolutely unusable without. The same goes for the pictures. Even at highest quality - and a lot of image enhancements, the results are mediocre. The audio portion of the video had a very noticeable hum, which I was able to remove with my audio editing software. Otherwise, the audio recording and playback were "acceptable," at best. This device is useful only as an audio recorder/MP3 player, and is not really a bargain
I just cancelled my subscription and recommended that my daughter cancel the one I bought for my 14 year-old grandson.  For some reason Ziff-Davis marketers think that  full page ads selling sex videos are appropiate for PC magazine. (Dec 27, 2005, p 122 if you want to check it out).  Previous issues had partial page ads selling "sex pheremones" which I could almost overlook, but full pages scantily clad lap dancers is over the line. 
My husband purchased this bag for me when I recently took a trip solo with my daughter. It seemed to be more troublesome than helpful. I ended up using the backpack strap to pull the bag because I could not pull using the regular strap in a comfortable positition. On the 1st flight the bag ripped at the seam on the bottom from scraping on the floor. When I arrived at my destination I restitched the bag and thought that maybe I had been careless in my handling. On the return flight we had to do more walking since the airport was a little bigger, though it was still a small airport. When I arrived at my destination the bag had completely separated along the bottom stitch and my car seat base had been scratched and mared as a result. The damage to the bag is so bad that I can never use it again. This bag should be labeled as disposable. Though this is a good concept there needs to be better planning on the overall design and quality. I would NOT recommend this product and will think twice before purchasing any other products from this manufacturer
Very slick easy to read watch with the contrast of silver hands on a dark blue face. Appreciate the smooth comfortable mesh watchband which easily adjusts to your wrist size.
My kids and I have several backpacking stoves - and we are currently ONLY using the Brunton CRUX... all the others have been mothballed.  The Brunton is well made and very reliable.  It's lightweight and very efficient.  We are able to cook for 3 people for one week using one large fuel canister
I expected this flavor to be as good as their Lemonada and Tangerine Strawberry, but it didn't even come close
After switching from Mac OS to Windows a few years ago, I needed a PC-oriented magazine to get me well versed in the new vernacular.  I took a look at PC Magazine and was disgusted by the number of errors and the dearth of useful content; man, I thought, this is why Mac users laugh at PC guys.  Then I picked up PC World at the suggestion of a friend and, wow, within minutes I filled out the subscription card and sent for my subscription. ---  --- PC World is good because it's informative and useful.  It covers things you want to know as a PC user.  It does not slant toward hardware (like the modders-only Maximum PC) or software, and it doesn't waste space telling you why you should buy a Mac G5, which, oddly enough, PC Mag tries to do.  PC World is a well-balanced, informational magazine for general PC users.  If you want more expert-oriented stuff you might want things like Windows Mag or other more specific magazines, but for general computing, PC World is the best.  Each issue is packed with stuff you can use, either in your daily computing or to impress your friends at the new year's party
This is a cute idea but the suction cups are misshapen and don't stick to my son's highchair at all. Very disappointing
I bought myself this book light after giving someone a $5 "robotic" book light from Walgreens. When she used hers it lit up the room. When I got mine today I tried it out and it barely lit up the palm of my hand. Had to smack it twice when the light flickered off to get it to come back on. It is flimsy, the light is dim and it's not worth the wait. Go to Walgreens instead. Mine is now lighting up the bottom of the trash can
First published in 1936, this is the 12th Poirot book, the 3rd Superintendent Battle book, and the 2nd Colonel Race book, and has no narrator. It's the first case in which Superintendent Battle, Mrs. Oliver, or Col. Race appear together with Poirot or each other, and the only case in which *all* do so at once. ---  --- The story opens at an exhibition of snuffboxes, where Poirot encounters Mr. Shaitana, a collector with a catty manner and a knack for gossip. Shaitana deliberately cultivates a Mephistopholean pose, which at first makes him seem like the potential quarry in the case - but it becomes clear that he's a victim waiting to happen. ---  --- For Shaitana, like a few other collectors in Christie's universe, has succumbed to a foolish temptation, and begun collecting *people* - and not just people of talent or genius, but murderers. And being a connoisseur, he collects only the best: those who have gotten away with it. He amuses himself on this occasion by boasting to Poirot of his hobby, without naming names, and inviting him to a little supper party to meet his collection of "tigers" (Poirot having just pointed out that he himself could admire a tiger, but would do so from outside the tiger's cage, having respect for the danger.) ---  --- Poirot accepts the supper invitation, however, to find that there are seven other guests, including the three other detectives as well as four guests who are presumably the murderers: explorer Major Despard, a strong silent type; Mrs. Lorrimer, a middle-aged widow who is *very* serious about bridge; timid young Anne Meredith; and Dr. Roberts, a loud and jovial general practitioner. ---  --- Shaitana drops hints referring to four possible methods of murder, but otherwise the subject does not come up, and the guests proceed to play bridge after supper - arising from the final game to find their host dead, stabbed sitting beside the fire in full view of the players! ---  --- This is, of course, Poirot's fantasy case, as he once remarked in THE ABC MURDERS - because there is no tangible evidence against any one person more than another. There are only the people themselves, and their memories of the evening, and the bridge scores reflecting how the evening progressed. Solving the case depends entirely on being able to understand the people involved. But how to get them to reveal their true selves to an interrogator - or to uncover the crimes that Shaitana believed they'd committed and gotten away with? ---  --- Rather than following Poirot's viewpoint in third person throughout, some chapters follow Battle, Race, or Mrs. Oliver as they conduct their own enquiries into the case. Each represents a different style: Battle is a professional police officer, Race an empire-builder-type secret agent, and Mrs. Oliver a writer of detective stories. Battle, of course, has a duty to investigate Shaitana's murder, and does so in an orthodox style, cultivating an image of plodding hard work that tempts one to underestimate him. Race deals with checking out Major Despard, the explorer who's most clearly his kind of person. Mrs. Oliver, for her part, works on worming information out of not only Anne Meredith, but her roommate Rhonda (whose attitude is that Anne could've lived like a duchess for the rest of her life on blackmail if she'd been paying attention). ---  --- And, of course, there's Poirot. He's really fascinating to watch in this one as he interacts with each suspect in turn, pursuing two major lines of questioning: --- (1) Describe how the bridge games played out, and --- (2) Describe the scene of the murder (the elaborate collector's room in Shaitana's house where the bridge games were played). ---  --- See if you can figure out where Poirot's questions lead before he reveals his reasoning to his colleagues, and what he learned from the responses he received
ridiculous plot, one dimensional cardboard-like acting (especially leon lai's rigid dead-like-fish-out-of-water performance), incoherent dialogs, horrible editing and directing, every thing is so bad if compares it to the first one. the second one has already turned bad but not as bad as this 3rd increment. the screen writers were obsessed with abnormal twists of the plots and tried to twist every section of the scenario to the extreme but unfortunately almost messed up the logic flow of a storyline. nothing deep but shallow all the way. just like a magician overplayed his black magic and suddenly found himself exposed completed without white gloves, long sleeves, and black cloak, even the white pigeons turned out to be dead. nothing could be hidden up in his sleeves or the tall hat. nothing at all. curtain call, drop it sooner than later.
I have not heard of or listened to, this cd series, but from the sound of it, its all bad interpretations of popular music.  I just want to say that if you want your kids to listen to music and you want to steer clear of the bad stuff... play classical music.  Play stuff without lyrics.  Play a show on tv where the characters sing.  Do anything but, buy a cd where people that aren't the original artists sing songs that were never intended to be for kids in the first place.  Censoring a song or cutting lyrics tends to ruin that song.  There are just some songs that aren't good for kids even if you cut out all the bad words.  Think about this... do you really want your kids coming up to you later in their life after hearing the real version of a song and asking you why the song they heard as a kid is so different from the one they just heard on the radio and then having to explain to them that the song they heard as a kid was a clean version of the song?  Listen... I'm all for trying to keep your kids away from inappropriate stuff for as long as possible, but cds like this are not the way to go.  All they do is make kids think that all music is going to sound just like the music on the cds and when they finally hear the real stuff, they're gonna be asking questions.  Do them and yourself a favor and don't buy these cds
I recently bought 3 items from this brand - Lumiscope. Actually this is the only item that works among them. Though I am kind of suspicious about it's inconsistent readings from time to time.  ---  --- I think Braun IRT452 is a much better product, which I bought one for my parents in China. During SARS epidemic it never failed and provided consistent readings.
I bought this thermometer and liked it but after I used it a few times the buttons stopped working and I couldn't turn it off. I opened it to remove the battery and found that it had water in it. A bath thermometer should at least be waterproof
Upgrading from the Treo 650, it is true that there isn't much new. Also issues such as the horrible battery duration and non-megapixel camera leave one frustrated. But the fact remains that the Treo 680 is one of the best smartphones on the market, particularly if you want good PDA functionality or are a PalmOS devotee. ---  --- So I accept the current Palm reality and adapt by buying 2 additional batteries. Not elegant, but it works. That doesn't mean that I won't tell Palm "Guys get your act together and come out with something far better!
Someone gave these to us when my son was 9 months old. He loved holding them and it has been fun watching him learn to "color" and develop his hand-eye coordination. He is now 22 months old and we've just used them up and I had to buy the Crayola tub crayons because I couldn't find these at Toys R Us. The Crayola crayons are thinner (which doesn't hold up as well to toddler abuse) and have more colors, but I like these better because they come with the ducky sponge to wash the crayon off the walls (my son loves that part, too). These crayons are a surefire way to get my son into the bathtub
His singing style is very unique as are his lyrics.  He has an eclectic mix of love songs, "we are the world" type songs and a few others on this album.  He has the staying power for long the long term and I would love to see him mature throughout the years and watch to see where he goes.  I loved Streetcorner Symphony!  It is so upbeat it can pull me out of whatever is ailing me.  Lonely No More is my theme song for right now in my life - needless to say I am replaying grooves in that one!  Enjoy this album - I sure do
This book is for readers with little or no knowledge of recent debates on energy security, global warming, etc. as well as related technological advances in fields such as hydrogen and fuel cells. The author contributes little to previous books on the subject, such as Rikin's book on hydrogen which is much better researched and just as accesible to the general public. If anything, the book's original contribution is to discuss how energy and environmental issues can be addressed using market mechanisms. In doing so, the author comes up with some interesting case studies, but it's quite obvious he is biased toward the same tired free-market ideology that is endlessly promoted in the pages of The Economist, which happens to be the author's employer. Moreover, there was little effort in integrating the various chapters. Overall, a very disapointing book. The author should stick to journalism
I really enjoyed the song Kids in America by No Secrets.  Both of my children enjoyed it as well.  In fact I have been looking for their CD or for more information on them.  I thought they were cute, fresh, and brought a new touch to the song
I was really excited when I saw this Doll, because I'm Navajo.  It's something I can let my daughters take into school to share during native American Month.  We all like it a lot
Unlike the first reviewer my experience with Trigger Finer has been a good one. At first it took me awhile to figure out how to get the device to control the drums in Impulse (Ableton Live) once I realized that each pad had to be set in order to have each tone mapped it was a breeeze. I suspect that maybe the first reviewer as well as any midi newbie might have difficulty in that respects since it is not plug in play as M Audio states....it is program and play, however once you get it programmed correctly it is effortless. The htinkg is it is soo expandable and programmable it may be to its own detriment especaiily for peolle who are not fimiliar with mapping out midi controllers
We love this new power toothbrush because it does a great job cleaning the teeth and it has so much more power than our old brush
I received these earrings as a Christmas gift from my sister.  They are perfect.  Their size is about the circumference of a dime.  Platinum adds elegance and yet, they are perfect for simple everyday wear.  You know they will never tarnish nor will they irritate your ears.  They are also perfect for young lady's first introduction to platinum jewelry. 
If you use Microsoft Office (Word, Excel) don't buy it!  Links to your previous .pdf simply don't work.  Adobe knows about it, but have no viable work around.  Stick with prevous versions. 
There's nothing outrageous about the title song - it's a lame, mind-numbing piece of crap compared to many other songs found on the "In the Zone" album: Imagine "Breathe on Me", "Touch of My Hand" or "Shadow" on constant radio play or running on MTV. And no, we're not apparently going to have that because Britney's precious time was wasted in incorporating this bore of a song into a single and even attempting a video out of it, like we know ended up in Britney's injury. For nothing.  --- Fortunately for this single, it's got the already legendary "Toxic" and a marvelous vocal mix version of "Everytime" - another star for that.  
Great story!!  Excellent in fact.  My beef is with the narrator and editor: ---  --- As someone who grew up in the Baltimore area, I thoroughly enjoyed the local references.  However, it is frustrating to hear the narrator mispronounce Baltimore icons, like Boog's BBQ at Camden Yards.  For the record, it is NOT pronounced Bow-g!  It is Boo-g... Do better research!!
I encourage many to stay away from this usb product; like previous reviewers said, just spend the extra money on a better usb dongle. As soon as i got this thing out of its package, i almost snapped the casing off due to its poor construction.   --- The main problem that i have experienced with this product is that although its range is ok(not the 100 meters that it claims), as soon as i go into a room thats only 10 feet away, has doors or walls in the way, the reception starts to fluctuate in and out every 2 minutes.
This series of diagnostic tools does not handle ABS.  I am not certain why ... whether the reason is merely a lack of software/firmware support for ABS or a physical interface issue. ---  --- Regardless, this tool has an easy to use menu structure and connectors for any imaginable vehicle
I LOVE everything about these sops!!!  They are luxurious and delicious at the same time......one thing I need to indulge in. --- The scents last for days after you've used them.....my bathroom still smells like a mix of verbena and honey-almond!!!! Just scrumptious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Not to mention how your skin smells and feels afterwards! --- These are amazing soaps that EVERYONE should use.  I feel exquisite using them and the gift sets are a fabulous thing to give to friends or even aquaintences.  They are sure to think of how thoughtful you were to give it to them everytime they use this wonderful soap!!!!!! 
I purchased one and was so pleased that I bought another.  Keeps liquids hot for hours, much better than the Thermos I had.  Wash by hand - do NOT put it in the dishwasher or it will lose its thermal effectiveness (voice of experience)
Pinback BLOWS me away.  I consider my taste in music to be very diverse, with a tendency to love obscure indie rock-pop, from the last three decades (talk talk, split enz to elliot smith and death cab).  Pinback delivers some of the best, most consistent music I've heard in YEARS.  I started with Summer in Abaddon and was weak in the knees, then I acquired their debut album and could barely stand...and now, Blue Screen Life has about knocked the breath right out of me.  I haven't gotten through the entire back catalog because I can't stop listening to the three albums I have in my hands.  Words cannot express how fascinating this band is - intricate & complicated with a simple, straightforward delivery.  Their transitions are SICK.  They put their contemporaries (death cab, the shins, the killers) to SHAME.  I love all of the aforementioned bands, but Pinback slaughters them in delivering well conceived, perfectly executed, diversified albums that you can listen to from front to back, over & over.  How many albums can you say that about?  They are heavenly.  The standouts are XIY, Boo, Concrete Seconds, Bbtone, Prog, Pene... oh, screw it - every song is GREAT! --- 
I recently decided to become vegetarian, so I got this book to read. I was very disapointed. I think this book provides good information about nutrional and meals, yet is written in a boring, scientific way. This book may appeal more to parents of vegetarians and vegans and adult vegetarians, than to teenagers. This book contains a lot of recipies, and some of them sound good, but most of them are far more complex than a teenager would be willing to cook. I would reccomend this book to parents of teenage vegetarians, but there are better books written for the teens themself. This book also has so many negative quotes including a whole page of someone making fun of vegetarian food and rambling about how they hate tofu. I don't think these are nessecary in a book for vegetarians, there is enough of that without reading about it. However, if you seriously want to research about being a vegetarian this book won't hurt, it is just a dissapointment
I must not have read the fine print!  This shirt MUST be a childs size.  It just fit.  Then one wash and way too small.  How can this be considered an XL???
A little known documentary that is both entertaining and informative. Touching first hand accounts and rare footage that give an extraordinary look at both Mr. Welles and the Brazilian culture. If there is one reason  to own this tape it would be to see over and over again the last part of  the film. A piece called "Four Men on a Raft" It is the most  beautiful black and white short film I have ever seen. The love Mr. Welles  had for these poor fishermen is so wonderfully apparent
Purchased this so my 7-year old can wake up on his own for school.  I checked several stores and was dissapointed to find nothing suitable for a child (didn't want radio, CD, telephone, and other features). ---  --- ** Pros ** --- 1. Very compact size, fits good next to bed --- 2. AC adapter with battery backup (even came with batteries) --- 3. LCD display doesn't have annoying illumination while trying to sleep.  Blue "glow" activates only when very easy to find button is pressed --- 4. Straight forward buttons and controls that took about 2-3 minutes for my 7-year old to learn.  Buttons are a good size and are not real hard to press. --- 5. Great styling as a kids clock --- 6. The projection feature is a BIG hit.  Projects about 4" high numbers on ceiling. --- 7. Projection intensity is good for laying in bed at night without lighting up the whole room --- 8. Decent construction for the $$$ ---  --- ** Cons ** --- 1. None for my particular application --- NOTE: If you are looking for a projection clock to use during the day (visible projection in sunlight), you will be extremely disappointed
I purchased this toy for my 3yr old in December last year. He has not been able to use it since we have not been able to find ANY products (discs, carrying case etc) for the videonow. I have called the company several times. Everything is always unavailable and I do check on a regular basis. My son has been watching black and white discs recently from his older brother on the machine so he will get some use out of it. It was a good idea but the company leaves a lot to be desired. If you make a product make sure that there are enough discs. It is simply a waste of money and time. I cannot continue going on line and checking a couple of times every week. I hope this info factors in in your decision to purchase this toy
I would give this toy a 0 if it was an option.  When you unfold the tiny track and get the train going, it can't even make one corner turn without coming off the track!  The train is too big for the sharp corners and it either sticks or completey comes off the track.  This is very frustrating for my kids and I cannot believe they even put this on the market?  You can't even get it to stay in the track when you manually push it.  I am just bummed that we threw away the box before we put in batteries and saw how bad this toy really is. ---  --- We wanted this toy for portability.  Our kids also have the GeoTrax Working Railway, which is awesome, but not as portable
I love this purse! I just wish I could get it in the emerald color, too. I have the magenta.
This fragrance took me quite by surprise when I first tried it from a magazine sample, so much so that I knew I had to try it at a department store - this was a little over a year ago. Then I sampled it at a department store and all my nose could think was "Wow!" - gardenias from my grandmother's garden, the suntan oils & tropical perfumes that I smelled as a little girl at the beach, with a few more florals blended in that make this fragrance even more exotic and sensual - I knew I had to have it! I bought myself a bathgel and lotion set and put the large bottle of cologne on my X-mas list, which my sweet & generous boyfriend got for me.  --- In my opinion, this is probably the most alluring fragrance for women that I have ever smelled. I feel very alluring every time I wear it for my boyfriend - and he loves it! So this would be a great gift for a man's wife or girlfriend, or for a woman's best friend, sister or cousin (as long as you wear it for your own man, too!), but a slightly awkward gift to give to your mother, aunt or grandmother - it's that enticing. But if your single older relative or friend simply must have it as one of her gifts, then have it given by one of her female friends, sister, cousin or "Santa". That way there won't be any awkwardness at gift-giving time. Believe me - this fragrance is the olfactory equivalent of French lingerie or a string bikini! 
I bought this kit as a gift for my boyfriend's birthday and was impressed with the quality (and size) of the items.  I did a bit of research for the perfect "starter kit" and thought this to be a good choice.  It has the basic essentials, a descriptive and helpful instruction book, and a few extras.  He was quite impressed and had fun opening all the individually bubble wrapped items!  We can't wait to pick up some sushi grade fish and get started.  One item to note, I spent some time looking through the book that was included and feel that this will be a great help in the process... simple steps, good instructions, and great photos
I cannot believe that Taxcut can no longer import capital gains info from Fidelity, which is has been able to do for several years.  I was a happy customer, now I'm a MAD customer.
My previous phone was the Motorola V60i with a monochrome screen with Cingular, so I am still getting used to all the differences in phone capabilities and have barely scratched the surface of what the i560 can do.  Here's a breakdown of the pros and cons so far (after a week). ---  --- PROS (in order of coolness, best first): --- 1. Nextel's Direct Connect is amazingly fast and their network very clear.   --- 2. Any call, either DirectConnect or regular call can be made with the flip open or closed.  You can scroll through recent calls with the flip closed and call any of them.   --- 3. If you're concerned about radio (RF) radiation - and you should be even though nobody talks about it anymore, this phone has the extendable antenna to get the transmission point further away from you (and improves the transmission).   --- 4. The speakerphone is as loud as you need it to be, even at dinning room table with the TV on and the sound patched through the stereo system (very impressive). There is virtually no lag in the switch between listening and speaking using the speakerphone (full duplex).  You can also turn its volume down to a whisper if you want to.  --- 5. The phone is a little wider than some phones (like the V60), but is very light.  Yet the phone meets the tough Military specs. --- 6. Rubberized grips on the phone make it easy to grip and dial with one hand and phone has a comfortable feel in my medium-sized hand. Phone has slight hourglass shape (wider at the bottom) to fit nicely into the hand. --- 7. Charger charges the battery FAST...MUCH faster than my V60 ever charged. --- 8. Phone has all the standard stuff I love and couldn't live without: voice dialing, custom rings for calls from my contact list, handsfree, long recent calls list (up to 20), ability to store number to Contacts from recent calls (without having to key the number, just have to enter the name).  ---  --- CONS (in order of annoyance, worst first): --- 1. The phone is almost completely made of plastic, and I've never thought plastic was as durable as metal. While Motorola makes truly awesome phones, I worry there might be an over-reliance on plastic to protect the insides of the phone. --- 2. When the phone is in the holster, the outside display is not visible, forcing me to remove the phone from the holster to see who's calling (for those that don't have a custom ring configured) or to check the time.  Very annoying, as I'm used to using my phone as a watch. --- 3. The icons on the outside display are small and those who are overdue for a new eye prescription might have trouble seeing and interpreting the icons.  The only two parts that are clear: the battery (important) and date/time. --- 4. The flimsy port cover at bottom of the phone (where you connect the charger, etc) make me think that someday I'm going to look down there and find it missing. It's easy enough to pop off, but sometimes takes "persuading" to put back and have it cover the slot completely (because it needs to be a snug fit to meet the military spec). ---  --- OVERALL, I really like the phone and highly recommend it to all
I connected all the cables as instructed, but it doesn't work, the light is not on. --- So I return it to Amazon
I rented the movie and I havn't seen the first three but this one was pretty good. It wasn't the absolute best horror film but good pace of the movie, good plots and story line. I don't recommend going out and buying it  righ away cause you should rent it first and decide for yourself
The Next Generation is basically a remake of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, in fact up to an hour into the film the plot is practically identical, though different characters and locations are used.  The original was a little overrated in my opinion and this "remake" is quite frankly terrible.  Bad acting with the exception of Renee Zellweger and Matthew McConaughy who do their best with a terrible script and several B movie actors.  The only major differences from the original are that Leatherface now dresses as a woman, which was fairly amusing but hardly essential, and a tacked on conspiracy theory. ---  --- The conspiracy theory of a secret society only surfaces in the last half hour and is absolutely ridiculous, I won't explain it, theres no point, watch it yourself if you want to know how stupidly the film ends.  I would sooner suggest avoiding this film completely though, even die hards admit its awful, I only gave it 2 stars because I reserve 1 star for the very worst of the worst (yes even worse than this!)
Make sure you know that these will work with your camcorder before buying. Apparently, they work fine with Sony camcorders (the packet too says so) but not with Canon. Also, it's incompatible with my new Panasonic camcorder too. Interestingly, it was displayed as a combo offer when I bought my Panasonic camcorder, which is the reason why I bought it anyway, but got duped
The range on this product is no where near what was advertised.  I purchased (2) units and neither will work consistently beyond 4-5 feet from mac.  Attempted to improve operation by relocating mac, using USB extension cable, and changing ID on transmitter with no improvement.  Extremely disappointed
I wrote this review because I felt that none of the reviews so far really got the main cause of this book. This is NOT a book about cosmology (as people would expect from Roger Penrose). In this tiny book, Penrose summarizes his idea that the mind cannot be understood by mathematical processes (something much different from the opinion of 99,99% of neurobiologists, such as Steven Pinker). This view is near to the Nobel laureate Murray Gell-Mann. The book is easy to understand and the ideas are very concise and its recommended for the ones that are interested in intelligence theories (thus, the author assumes that the reader know what a neuron is and how it works!). Some may think this is a difficult to understand book because they didn't had in mind that this book is about Penrose's point of view on intelligence. In fact, I'm not a physicist, nor a biologist, simply a high school student and I found the book very easy to understand, although I do not agree with Penrose's point of view. I think he forgot something very important. Read it and read the other point of view and you'll find what it is! :
Anybody know the name of the song played at the very end of the movie, when the brother and the sister are saying goodbye to each other, when she is crying and asking him what he is going to do with his life? Right before he enters the bus... I would LOVE to listen to it again but I can't find it anywhere..
I ordered the unit twice, and twice I received a Carrying Case. not the adapter.  I returned both and ordered direct from Cobra.   --- When I had called customer support for Amazon the second time, I got connected to India of course and was informed that a lot of their codes are wrong.  I guess they are trained to agree with anything the customer says.
I carry a lot of tension in my neck and upper back, and as a result get a lot of headaches.  I have been using the Real-Ease for about two months, and have found it very effective at releasing the tension in my neck and upper back and alleviating my headaches.  I have not used it as a preventative - only when I already have a headache.  If something happened to the one I have, I would definitely buy another
This remasted disc is nice with the bonus tracks and spiffed up sound, but the only way top hear Aoxomoxoa is to find a original W7 (Warner Brothers-Seven Arts) green label vinyl pressing. The CD features the 1971 remix (like the 1989 CD) in which 1/3 of the backing has been stripped like Constanten's prepared backrounds on "What's Become Of The Baby", the extra drums and barbershop vocal on "Doin That Rag". St Stephen lost something in the remix as well. Anthem was remixed as well in 1972 but the band was wise to issue the 1968 mix on CD. No hidden goodies on this disc, but the bonus tracks are great

Nobody is safe from satire, not even Alfred Hitchcock. But Mel Brooks straddles the line between parody and affectionate homage in "High Anxiety," a hysterical psychiatric comedy that deftly references all sorts of Hitch films -- while keeping in Brooks' trademark slapstick, hilarious dialogue, and weird characters.  ---  --- Dr. Richard Thorndyke (Brooks) has just been hired as the director of Psychoneurotic Institute for the Very, VERY Nervous, after the sudden death of the previous administrator. Something odd seems to be going on -- screams are heard, a patient signals Thorndyke with a mirror, and Dr. Charles Montague (Harvey Korman) frightens a patient into fits. Then one of the doctors dies mysteriously, while trying to leave the conspiracy.  ---  --- And when Thorndyke is lecturing at a psychiatry convention, the evil Nurse Diesel (Cloris Leachman) sends a hired killer (wearing a Thorndyke mask) to frame the doctor for murder. Now Thorndyke must elude the police and the killer, clear his name with the help of a mysterious blonde heiress (Madeleine Kahn), and overcome his crippling "high anxiety."  ---  --- As a homage/spoof, this is gold. Brooks deftly weaves together elements and storylines from various Hitchock movies, including "Vertigo" and "Spellbound," with some nods to "Psycho," "North By Northwest" and "The Birds." There's dizzying looks down a wooden tower, newspaper "stabbings" in the shower, and Madeleine Kahn's strange not-so-icy blonde.  ---  --- But it's also a great movie in its own right. Rather than outright slapstick as in some of his movies, Brooks instead crafts a clever thriller framed with delicious comedy -- he even makes fun of some standard filmmaking devices. For example, Thorndyke's hotel suite is switched for a top-floor room because of a call from... "a Mr. McGuffin."  ---  --- And he fills it with hysterical comedic situations, like Victoria mistaking the sounds of a life-or-death struggle for a phone sex pervert, or Thornduke being assaulted by a crazed bellboy. And his dialogue is solidly quotable in this one ("Those who are tardy do not get fruit cup"). The highlight has to be murder-by-bad-pop song, where a man is trapped in a car with the unspeakably bad "If You Love Me Tell Me Loud Loud Loud."  ---  --- Gene Wilder wasn't available when this was made, so Brooks took the lead himself. The seriousness of the character doesn't entirely fit him, but he's a solid enough Thorndyke, especially when he has to give a G-rated speech about penis envy.  ---  --- Most of the comedy comes from an unfortunately blonde Madeleine Kahn as the chic love interest, as well as a ghoulish Leachman and S&M enthusiastic Korman ("Too much bondage, too much bondage, not enough discipline!"). And Ron Carey and Howard Morris round the cast off, as the photographically obsessed chauffeur and the stereotypical little German shrink.  ---  --- "High Anxiety" is an affectionate parody/homage to Hitchcock -- even Hitchcock was pleased by it -- but it's also a solid comedy movie. Definitely worth seeing! ---  --- (Stalking, R-Hag?
I bought a set of these Uno cards for my 9-year-old grandson, a Nintendo "freak." The first night he had them he played three games with whoever was handy, and spent an hour alone arranging the cards just so. He took them to bed with him. A few days later he dashed into his other grandparent's house showing off his fancy deck of Uno cards and insisted that they play a game. He even wrote us a Thank You note telling us that the cards were the "coolest present I ever got." ---  --- The rules of the game have not changed, just the look of the cards. Nintendo characters, in all their bright colors, are the "suits." The cards are housed in a metal box, a throwback to the front half of the 20th Century. Excellent art work on the cards and on the box. ---  --- The cards and the game are appealing to all ages. I enjoyed playing and getting acquainted with the Nintendo characters (my grandson explained them all to me). This is a great family game and this Nintendo set is a great gift. It helps close the "generation gap." I highly recommend this item. Enjoy. ---  --- One last thing: I bought a second deck for another grandson and his response was pretty much the same.
I tried this swing then this Fisher-Price's Open Travel Swing. In both swings my baby would lean forward and fold himself in half in the seat. The Jungle swing was difficult to haul around since it didn't stay closed well and the "palm tree" was always in the way. Finally I bought the Fisher-Price Aquarium Swing. I found the seat of the Aquarium swing to be deeper and it clicks in place (so it won't fold over on baby) and it is easier to assemble and haul around
We bought this game knowing Shrek movies are a bit raunchy, but thinking the game would be ok for a 6 year old to play.After watching my son play this game for a few minutes... I saw that he had to stun chickens and put them in a pot of boiling water while they were still alive. Then after that, he punched large turtles and threw them on tables where there backs were cracked open and died.  I can't believe a game that is rated E for Everyone would have little kids (or whoever played it) have to be so mean to animals.  What's next, ripping the head off a rabbit? I consider myself one of the coolest moms around, but this totally crossed the line
     this stroller is the BEST 250.00 that i have spent in a long time!!  we live in texas and were using a regular double stroller to walk the dog with our 2 daughters (aged 16 mo's and 3) around a one mile loop in our neighborhood.  depending on weather and moods sometimes we'd do 3 laps.  it was such a CHORE pushing that old stroller up and down our neighborhood hills.  plus, i can actually JOG or even RUN!!!  i can't tell who loves it more, me, the dog, or my girls.  it's light, easy to steer, worth EVERY penny.  plus, i love the fold out visors for shade for the girls.  oh, and it was incredibly easy to put together
These steaks were tender and tasted very good.  So good in fact, we ordered more
It was pretty damn funny! ---  --- This movie was recommended by my good friend, Bobby Asslong.  In most cases his recommendations are a bunch of [...], but he hit it right on, with this one!  I detest Tom Green.  He is one of those guys, who that when he fails at something (Talk Show, most of his movies, life) I actually feel happy.  And this is actually contrary to my normal personality.  I normally automatically love all Canadians.  Just kidding. I normally want people to succeed, and feel bad when they fail.   ---  --- But Tom Green is so annoying. ---  --- Great news!  He is in only about 4 or 5 scenes in this whole movie, so you should be able to get through this movie, with little to none hatred for Mr. Green. ---  --- I love all the characters in this movie, especially the main protagonist, who accidentally sends the videotape to his girlfriend at a far away college.  He is very likeable, and you're pulling for him the whole time.  Another thing I like this movie, is that it pulls a lot from other "gross out" teen and college flicks, but it doesn't go overboard in the gross out department. ---  --- Tom Green plays the Voice Over explainer in the movie, and he actually does a pretty good job, without appearing stupid.   ---  --- I give this high reviews! ---  --- MC White said:  Check it out!!
I' writing this eview onthe nwkeoard tht I picked up a few urs  Don stop redingdue to th numerous misspellins and rors.  That's the kyboard, nome!!  I'mt ba to to y na o y n Acino esr I ia. ---  --- Ok, switching over to a wired keyboard!!  The above mess was me trying to type on the Microsoft 6000 V2 Keyboard!!  I'm taking it back to the store ASAP!!  According to the programs, I have a full signal on both the keyboard and the mouse while typing, but you see what comes out!  Not once have I had a low signal warning or anything.  I just get random intermittent letters to appear.  Now, perhaps it's because the receiver is back by my monitor and the keyboard is on the keyboard tray, but my goodness!  This thing is supposed to have a range of 6 feet.  I measured and they're about a foot and a half apart!! ---  --- I type for hours on end per day and have been typing "properly" for about 16 years.  I type much too fast and much too frequently to be able to deal with such random signals!!  Another thing I noticed about the 6000 (and actually was concerned with it while I was trying it out in the store) is that it makes my fingers feel cramped.  Perhaps it's due to the curve of the keyboard and I'm just not used to it yet (although I have used split key ergonomic keyboards and never had a probelm with them.  The 4000 felt fine (even though it has a somewhat awkward layout!!) ---  --- No matter what, that thing is going back!  I'm far too agitated to keep it! ---  --- Oh, there are some neato plusses!  I love the shortcut keys.  It's nice to be able to just hit one key and get my e-mail, my music, my pictures, or whatever else I assign the keys to.  I had gotten excited about that feature, and will be sad to lose it (even though I only had it for about an hour.) ---  --- Better luck to the rest of you
I had to send this item back because it stopped playing cds. The sound quality was good, but the dependability of this item is questionable.
CONS --- *WON'T STAY IN PLACE --- I've tried several times to position this correctly and it always slips out of place (and baby is out of view) I even sent away for the extra tether thinking that was the problem but no luck. --- *WHY A REMOTE? --- Tell me what use the remote is when you have to press the on button which is located ON the mirror and then if you don't use the remote within five minutes to turn it on it automatically shuts off rendering the remote useless for the remainder of your car ride?  --- *THE IRRITATING SONG  --- too short and plays over and over and over (teeth gritting) --- *LEARN WHAT? --- I've also noticed in the teaching mode it doesn't light up the right item with what the voice is saying. My poor confused baby will now think a blue car is a boat and a yellow house is a car... ---  --- PROS --- *Now I have $39.99 less to spend on snacks that will hinder me from losing those pregnancy pounds I gained..
I bought this almost exactly 2 years ago, and I turned it on the other day and went to take a picture indoors that required a flash, and the flash would not work. It was set to automatic flash.  Using the auto setting, I thought there used to be 3 flash settings (auto, forced flash and no flash), but now there were only 2.  I took it outside on a sunny day and used the auto flash, and the flash went off outside!  Something is messed up and it has the light and dark confused.  ---  --- Thinking I hit something and changed a setting, I reset it to the factory defaults and it still doesn't work.  It will probably be too expensive to get it fixed, and it's weird but I just upgraded to a Nikon D50.  I must have known this camera was about to die. ---  --- Even when it worked, half the time pictures came out blurry. I either got fantastic crystal clear shots or blurry ones as if the auto focus missed.  Maybe the camera was defective the entire time I had it. No more Canons for me
This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film. ---  --- Sweetie, written and directed by award winning filmmaker, Jane Campion best known for the film "The Piano" is the story about a young couple in a distant relationship. One day the womans mentally ill sister Dawn "Sweetie" breaks into their house and lives with them. She is not on her medication and creates havoc. When her father visits after his wife leaves him, he tries to calm her but is unsuccessful.  ---  --- It is never mentioned what kind of illness Dawn has. I thought the film was too graphic and recommend eaisliy offended people not watch it. ---  --- The DVD has some great special features. There is a theatrical trailer, behind the scenes photos, audio commentary by director Jane Campion and director of photography, Sally Bongers and screenwriter Gerard Lee. There are interviews with lead actresses, Genevieve Lemon and Karen Colston. There is a 1989 conversation between Campion and film critic Peter Thompson made after the success of her short films. ---  ---  Finally, there are 3 of her short films made as a student. The first film, An Exercise in Discipline: Peel, is about a man and his son and sister out for a drive. The son has trown orange peels out the window and his father stops the car and demands he pick them up. The second film, Passionless Moments; is a series of short scenes about various situations. The third film, A Girl's Own Story, is about schoolgirls who do various activities. ---  --- This film is ok but is not appropriate for children
I don't know why this is, but when I put on the Dale Sr. shell for this car it started to understeer on left turns and would always crash into walls
My 8 year old daughter brought this book home from her school library and was excited by many of the projects. From a parent's point of view it was great to have a book with achievable craft projects which yield items the  child can be proud of and parents will happily display. I'm ordering it  now
McMurry's text is a very friendly, gentle intro to  organic. It's a thoroughly enjoyable read, but it doesn't teach you what you need to  know.  Explanations for important mechanisms are usually very brief, and the  problems included are usually very basic and general (the spectroscopy and  synthesis problems, in particular).  If you're looking to become a chemist,  this is not the book to learn from. I'd recommend  Vollhardt and Schore's  textbook, or any number of sophomore-level texts that will give you the  skills you need to approach complicated problems more successfully (i.e.,  on exams or out in the industry)
This isn't a review of this product, so much as it's a review of the impression it makes.  Anyone who was in Paris around the turn of the century will remember Aubade's "Lecons de Seduction" advertising campaign, of which the image shown here for this "tanga" was a part.  Each item of lingerie featured in the ads featured a little piece of advice to the wearer as to how she could use this item to make the right sort of  impression ... and isn't that just what frilly little underthings like this are for?  Nothing has made a stronger impression on us
I bought this toy for my 4 year old grandaugher.  Since Barbie rides this horse of course a little girl will want her doll to ride the horse.  The wings fall off.  We must put the wings back on at least a dozen time a day
I've had several trimmers over the years and this one is by far the best.  Strong motor, easy adjust, strong vacuum.  Other reviewers commenting on the flimsy guard is kinda suprising to me.  One wouldn't want to push down hard against the face when trimming a beard.... the idea is to glide the unit over your beard... you're not raking, you're trimming! --- Also the unit is easy to clean out after use.  The waste receptacle snaps out easily, as does the cutter head in order to shake out or brush out debris
In considering that I purchased this item for my bedroom, I would have to say that it is perfect.  For aesthetic reasons I preferred an analog wall clock, but the thought of hearing the second hand tick all night was not an option until I found this item by LaCrosse.  It could not be anymore perfect, as its looks, PRICE, and self (time) adjusting qualities has made this an. "M.F." (Major Find).  Now I can sleep through the Daylight Savings time adjustments not having to worry about the actual adjustment of my clock, but whether or not I will be an hour early, or late to work
Well, this is one of the long-waited DVDs from Pink Floyd. --- The video and sound are great. The extras are not so special but for the PF fan this is a must. --- Still waiting for the "Delicate sound of thunder" DVD
If you can stick to a workout routine, this home gym is perfect for you.  After a bit of assembly, you'll be able to do all your exercises at home
This shoe is very comfortable, unfortunately I had to send it back to the manufacturer twice, the second time choosing a different style shoe because the net material comes loose from the seems where the laces are. I am very dissapointed as I have come to expect quality from Merrell and these shoes fall apart in a few weeks.  I would recommend a different shoe as this one will last you between 1 and 3 weeks before ripping
I have tried several types of pads and these are the worst! They are very small, thick, and do not hold much, causing them to overflow and leak. I'd recommend the Gerber pads
This is NOT the most recent version for this software.  Do an online search, check the manufacturer's web site and you'll find it cheaper for the latest version
The Pros are this product has alot of functionality for the price. The odometer and heart rate functions were very accurate. The set-up and operations get easier with use (first few times you will need to refer to the manual). The manual is well written and thorough. The cons are the altimeter which is far from accurate
I am realtively new to country music. I purchased this because I had the pleasure of hearing Willie sing "You Don't Know Me" on CMT one afternoon. I was quite taken with his rendition and recalled hearing this song growing up. From this one time "soft rocker" I couldn't be happier. Go Willie
I just purchased this item -  now I'm planning to return it tomorrow.  One of the advertised features, the ability to store liner notes just doesn't work properly.  They just don't into the pocket without bending and/or forcing them in.  To me, the liner notes have value and I'm not willing to fold, spindle, or otherwise mutilate them to fit them into the wallet
In theory an excellent product -- room for lots of disks, relatively compact and attractive HOWEVER I purchased three of these (2 for me 1 for a friend) I can't say how his is doing but both of mine have faulty zippers, making  it impossible to close the binders and therefore losing much of their attractiveness and compactness. (...). All in all, a disappointment
These were perfect, the girl liked them, they're the perfect size, not very expensive, great gift
The heart on the bracelet came off after the second day of wear.  I do not recommend the product, but the delivery and service were done well
I am a single mom and have never done my taxes by myself. The cost to have taxes done is ridiculous.   This is the best thing ever.  It walks you thru everything and is very easy to use.  I will buy this product again next year.. 
Not to impressed with this company. 3rd item I have bought and the table top had to be reglued and screwed. Also the table top had major horizontal cracks. I don't believe they check their quality of their products
I never wear this top after having purchased it.  The stripes have awkward stitches that irritate the skin touching them.  The shirt itself hangs very awkwardly.  I prefer fitted shirts for working out and this one kind of flares out at the waist on me and, therefore, isn't very flattering.  I think I've worn it once and will probably donate it soon.  Generally, I have been pleased with Adidas products, but this shirt did not work for me personally. 
We loved this toy when my daughter received it for Christmas.  She loved to lay in her crib and look at it and recently even learned to turn it on by herself!  This morning I looked at the toy and noticed that the water compartment was almost empty!  The water drained out of the compartment it belongs in and back in to the part which contains the musical mechanisms and the battery connections!  It's not exactly fixable, so we will move on to another crib toy
This is the absolute cutest general neutral baby bedding set out there.  The colors are fabulous, the material is soft and nice, and I was SO pleased by its overall quality.  We also purchased some of the extras, (the lamp, pillow, and wall hangings) and were just as pleased.  I would reccommend this bedding to any person expecting a child that doesn't wish to know the gender before it's born, but also any parent that does know, be assured, it is great for a girl or boy, especially if you like animals!! 
     This pack is really Bad! I LOVE attacktix, but this pack is terible! The only good figues are Luke Skywalker, and Megatron. Darth Vader's arm broke, Super Optimus Prime's blast shoots before you press the button, and the battle masters are Pathetic. The Battle Master's point value is 70 each, but they are very easy to kill, and their blasts are very bad. ---     Do yourself a faver, skip this and buy the Star Wars attacktix series 4 starter set
My sister said her 3yo son loved and and was able to play in it with his 1yo brother! I don't really know how durable it is, she lives in another state but said they liked it alot
This version "Wind and Cloud - The Storm Riders" made in 2004 is not the same as "The Storm Riders" made in 1998. ---  --- This dvd is a condensed version of a TV series packaged by Tai Seng. It is full-screen and was made for TV. It is pretty disjointed as it was condensed into 2 hours from 30 hours. ---  --- Most people doing the reviews for this DVD is confusing everyone writing positive reviews for the 1998 film staring Aaron Kwok and Ekin Chen
I got some pens free with rebate from Staples once.  And I love them.  I used to use Uniballs, but these last longer and write smoother.  Plus, they're retractable - and not a bad value, either
This movie has a lot of meaning behind it. The actors put on a really good show. Movie is lacking special effects but that does not hurt the quality in any way. Story keeps on unfolding in unexpected ways. --- 
this pair of pistols is quite entertaining. i have purchased quite a few airsoft guns in the last 6 months, and these are surprisingly the more powerful of what ive purchased. dualing spring pistols is a challenge, but there are ways to work the slide with 1 hand. they're flimsy, but with enough care and responsibility theyll last a while. definitely worth 16 buck
This movie was cheeseball beginning to end...I thought the concept was corny even before I watched it but decided to give it a try anyway. Big mistake. A robot who can love? Lame! And with all this high tech stuff the docs can't bring the couple's real son out of a coma (or whatever was wrong with him) so the parents forget all about him and get some robot kid who can 'love' but lacks the common sense of a human making him a danger to himself and everyone..Brialliant plan (especially considering the amount of orphan human kids there must be in this messed up futuristic world)..Then the real son wakes up and comes home and thats when the problems with the robot kid begin. The family decides they don't want the robot and the mom 'loves' him so much she dumps him somewhere instead of sending him back to the lab to be humanely disposed of...It was then I knew I was smelling a stinker but NOOOOO someone else wanted to watch it till the end until he soon found out the horrible truth...I have since nicknamed it Artificial Idiocy...The worst part was the end, Ugh, I don't even want to get into it but those of you who see the title of my review above and have seen the movie know what I mean. The whole plot was muddled and full of holes with no sense of realism. For those of you who have not seen it, I suggest renting it before you buy it. Maybe this movie is great for some people, it just wasn't my thing. 
I  was very impressed with this item.  The cards are adorable and extremely well made.  The box is great too.  I highly recommend this product and I will tell all my friends about it.
This is a great snorkel.  Seals well against your face and the water really does stay out if a wave comes by.  The purge valve on bottom works well
I purchased this movie for my 7 year old twin boys birthday thinking that because it said the rating was PG that it would be fine.  Also, the market for Transformers is huge with boys their age and the toys being sold everywhere.  Wow, were we hugely surprised to hear curse words on this cartoon movie.  These were not just words like shoot or dang, but the real deal.  I remember Transformers when I was growing up and I certainly do not remember their being foul language in the cartoons.  I am going to take this matter up with higher management and at least get my money back and try find out what they were thinking.  Who knows what the rating will end up being for the upcoming movie at the box office.   --- Concerned in Alabam
Nothing but problems with unit since I received it.  Either it did not work when I went to use it or it had lost its memory and had to be recalibrated all over again.  Never had the same weight reading twice! The only reason I rated it with 1 star is because it would not let me enter anything less
I read the review Marci Carl about the Jennifer Chiaverini books The Quilter'ed Apprentice.  I am as totally hooked on these books and have them all now as I am your magazine.  Then I had to go get on the computor and found Jennifer's site.  Now I want to get back into quilting big time.  My husband just rolls his eyes. 
I have two double strollers, 1 front and back Graco and this side by side Aria.  I don't use the front/back Graco much do to not being able to have both children sleeping at the same time (2 1/2 year and 1 year.  I had the Peg MT single first and loved it.  So thought the product quality would be the same.  Used it for 2 years with no problems.  But have to say stay clear of the aria design.  Our side by side had numerous pieces fall off, cup holder, seat clip, logo tag, clip to hold trays in place, etc.  Its not durable at all!  We even have to close it using a pen on one side due to the clip you lift on the left side falling off too!  We took it on a plane trip last week and have sworn the whole stroller off.   My sister in law had the single and was having the same problems with the product.  She has since bought the Maclaren single and I am in the process of purchasing the Maclaren Twin Techno.  It may cost more but it would have been alot cheeper buying it first than second
It takes an HBCU graduate to write about the HBCU experience, period. Just look at "A Different World" and how bad the first season was. Debbie Allen (a Howard grad, I believe) stepped in and gave the show the authenticity it sorely needed. So it's no surprise that Spike Lee, the Morehouse man, would make a movie that sparked so much emotion on both sides of the coin. I'm not saying that you had to attend an HBCU to UNDERSTAND "School Daze", but you had to have attended one to get the real "flavor" of what it was like. And you have to have an open mind. ---  --- Any HBCU alum saying that this film wasn't realistic is flat-out lying. Yes, it hit on some things that the old folks call "dirty laundry" (such as hazing, color issues, those who think that getting an education makes you "white", and so on), but those things are real at HBCUs - yes, even today. (Major props to Spike for having that ONE dark-skinned sista in the Gamma Rays. Isn't that ALWAYS the way?) And there are no "good" people or bad people; Spike leaves that decision up to you. Julian had his good points (his intelligence, leadership and pride in his town, school, etc) and Dap had his bad points (his blatant bigotry and bullying), and both of them had legitimate points.  ---  --- One thing Spike nailed right on was the confrontations that the students tended to have on a regular basis. No offense to whites or anyone who graduated from a PWC, but in my experience at a predominately white high school, I noticed that students there were a lot more subtle with their dislike; they particpated in a more "destroying from within" kind of system, and grew wide-eyed and offended when confronted, even with solid proof. ("I would NEVER spread rumors about you/sleep with your boyfriend/steal your term paper!") Black students, on the other hand, will take ANYONE head-on, whether that person is the school president, captain of the football team, the richest kid on campus, crippled...doesn't matter. Your "status" doesn't count if you go to an HBCU. I had a friend who saw SD and said "That is SO unrealistic! Since when do college kids go fighting with each other all the time?" She graduated from the University of Texas. Enough said. ---  --- I'm so grateful for this film, and its realistic portrayal of black HBCU students for those who think that all young black people do is have babies and suck up welfare, and that people only go to HBCUs because they can't get into a "real" college. I wouldn't trade my experience at Florida A&M University for a degree at any PWC. RATTLERS
For all of you looking for that favorite book "The Silly Book", join my club (not literally).  The book that has the ode to Boodleheimer was written by Stoo Hample not Babette Cole.  I have been searching for this book for years.  Good luck everyone, and let me know if you find an extra copy for sale
I didn't switch of after 3 minutes because I thought the film was trying to be deliberately bad as a precursor for the better bits to come.  I switched off after 7
I don't think that it is possible to get better beef jerky for the price. My wife and two kids also find it to be delicious
I love this potty chair!!  It is so simple, and that is what I like about it - simple to use & simple to clean.  My little boy loves it
I used Version 8 and 9 and NEVER experienced a problem.  Version 10.latest version is terrible.  Crash and burn.  Don't take their advice and re-install your operating system.  Its THEIR software and not the OS.  Amazon and Pinnacle (Avid) continue to sell this product even though its terrible.  I read it was re-written for version 10 and they CAN'T get it right.  Nonetheless, they still charge full price and for support calls. The upgrade should have been free. ---  --- There are several good products now so Pinnacle isn't your only choice.  I changed to Sony Vegas and am very happy but it does a have a learning curve.  For super simple try Ulead or one of the others.
Perfect, exactly what I expected and wanted. I ride to work in rain or shine or storm and was sick of the water shooting up, had it on in less then 5 min. My bike is full suspension, 26 inch wheels with that horse shoe (U) bar on the lower legs of the front fork and it still fit with no problem. Don't know how it would handle a crash in trees though, sits high like a dirt bike look. People ask where I got it
If you like a strong but smooth flavorful coffee this is it. I have tried others and just keep coming back to this one. My second joice would be the Starbucks Italian blend
I am a huge black licorice fan, however I don't think I'd really experienced black licorice until I had Panda black licorice. Great, intense licorice flavoring, extremely addictive.  If I open up a box, I find it very hard to stop munching until the box is empty!  Delicious
I am a new harmonica player trying to substitute shopping and technical research for practice and talent.  I went out and bought nearly every diatonic harmonica under 40 bucks.  Most fell by the wayside.  I still use the Special 20 every day for a couple of reasons. The one I have is easy to play.  And only the plastic cone touches your lips, not the brass plate that sticks out on lots of Hohners.  (That's the only reason the Golden Melody comes in second for me.)  Overall, it just feels really nice in your hand, smoother even than the non-stick Pro models.   ---  --- Unless you are shopping addicted, as I am, this is the only harmonica you are going to need for a long time
I really like Bruce Campbell and his movies like Army of Darkness. But this movie is not in the same league. First of all the plot is slow and boring. Bruce does not have the same rouge character that he is so good at. Instead the movie is filled with frankly depressing scenes of him in bed or limping around barely able to move. This really hampers the action aspects of the movie. The dialogue aspect is not much better.  ---  --- If you like Bruce, my advise is to get his other movies or try to get a hold of the TV episodes of  "Jack of all trades" episodes. It is a lot more fun and has the "real" Bruce
This product is a great evening tea to help you relax and gently eases you too sleep.  Before this I was taking harsh medicines like Tylenol PM's and such and always woke up feeling worse than before I went to bed!  Not with the tea!  Let me clarify, it will not knock you out, but just help to relax you
The only reason I am giving this 1 start is becuase of Amazon's poor service, otherwise I would give 5 stars for the product.  I placed this order more than 30 days ago.  Amazon still has not shipped the item so I cancelled my order and placed it with J&R.  If Amazon did not have the item in stock, they should have stated on their web site or at least communicated with me that there will be a delay in Shipping
I happen to love pecans and this product is loaded with them. It's too bad the cans are so small
Quick reader, poor design. It does a great job copying images to my Mac, but the flimsy lid is a piece of poo-poo. It stays on tight, which is good, until you try to open it. The force required to open it pulls the lid completely off making the ball-groove hinges useless. It's only a matter of time until the weak arms containing the hinges snap off, leaving the reader exposed to the elements
I've bought two of these atomic clocks. The first, a 12" wood framed model, soon stopped keeping accurate time and started acting unpredictably. The second, this model, has been on my wall for a week and is keeping good time after an easy setup: insert battery, push EST button.  ---  --- I am nicking it a star because it makes a noticeable tick sound in a quiet room, making it inappropriate for a bedroom
This is another nice Tinkerbell accessory for the car.  The graphic is nice looking.  The material appears to be good quality.  I expect it to last for some time
Great magazine.  But don't subscribe here.  You can do it online at her website or tear out the order form in a magazine and it will cost 50% less
Unavailable for some time, the Sky High Suspension Bridge is back.  Once you have the ramps to get the track up there, it really stands out as a part of the railroad. ---  --- Assembly was required but routine; the directions were quite adequate.  There are no stickers to wiggle into place
I bought this product to use during my camping trips. I had a minor issue with my order but was corrected immediately, great customer service. This is a really neat hammock, it packs really small but is very resistant. My friends loved it when they saw it and it was really easy to set up. You will enjoy it whether you go camping or on your backyard
Compared to FrontPage and its infamous "bots", Expressions Web is a refreshing piece of software from Microsoft that out-DreamWeavers DreamWeaver.  As a long time DreamWeaver user, the ability to easily stay in design mode in Expressions Web while building your user interface without the incredible futz-factor that DreamWeaver imposes is its greatest strength. This is a very impressive, stable product that I plan to use a great deal in my non-.net web development work. It makes building and maintaining pure html web sites and newsletters much easier and more intuitive than ever
The book "Communicating Effectively" is a home run!  The format invites an easy read with quick reference potential.  Building on the fundamentals of good communication Lani takes us around the bases and adds authentic and practical ways of dealing with issues we all face.  She brings us home again with new skills learned and a more effective game plan to approach the communication challenge
I'll be brief: ---  --- First of all: out of the 81 reviews of this product currently on Amazon, 31 are 1-star.  That should tell you something. ---  --- Pros: --- When it actually works, it /does/ cool down your 360. ---  --- Cons: --- 1) Crashing --- Caused more crashes than it prevented.  Running without the Nyko instantly reduced the number of crashes and freezing problems I had. ---  --- 2) Loud as hell --- Turn on your 360.  Put a hairdryer next to it, and turn it on, on low.  Step back and sit where you normally play.  That is how loud this product will make your 360. ---  --- 3) Hard to set up, frequently stops working. --- It took a lot of playing around just to get it to work the first time.  It snap fits well to the back of the 360, but despite that, there's some impossible magic to the angles and tightness of the power connector... we're talking millimeter tolerances here.  If you're off by just a tiny bit, it won't work at all, and the XBox won't even power on.  This wouldn't be too bad if you only had to go through this headache once, but no: it's loose enough that you risk disconnecting it (and setting it up all over again) every time you touch the power cord or move the 360. ---  --- 4) Many people have reported this unit causing actual damage to their 360s.  You better have a replacement plan for your 360 handy, and never mention the Nyko when you try to RMA your box.  If you let it slip, you probably won't be covered. ---  --- That's it for the Nyko.  I returned mine within 2 weeks. ---  --- I've been searching for a good cooler for the 360 since I got one.  Unfortunately, it is my opinion that there are NO GOOD COOLERS FOR THE 360 ON THE MARKET.  The fan-stands (yes, I've bought and returned them) are decent coolers, but require you to run your 360 vertically, which is a big no-no.  A number of websites have shown that the 360 DVD-rom drive will EAT your DVDs and games when it's vertical.  I had hoped this was overexaggerated, but then the problems started happening to me... I'ver personally seen what appears to be damage on my /mint/ condition games when running the 360 vertically.  I also experienced frequent game-loading problems (including hideous slowdowns) in games like Halo 2 (where you can actually see a progress bar) when played on a vertical 360 (it worked just fine with it horizontally).  So, horizontal is the way to go. ---  --- In the end, I ended up building my own cooler out of some old (still loud, but MUCH QUIETER) computer fans and a 12 volt adapter, and slapped it on the side.  Works well, probably cools as well as the Nyko, but without the noise or the crashing!  Your best bet, if you can't do something like that, is to just buy a little clip fan (with its own power adapter) and have it blow into the right side/bottom (the vents away from the DVD drive) of your 360
This is a nice case, however, i needed something more sleek and small to fit into my purse when i go out with my friends. This case is bulky and my Panasonic FXO1 would fit into something much smaller. I ended up going with a great case that i found at Wal-Mart for a cheeper price, sleeker design, small enough to hold my memory cards and camera and still fit into the small purses i take when i go out on the town
This is a GREAT magazine! I love the beautiful pictures . . . even if I'm not looking for a project - this is enjoyable just to look through. I really love the fact that there are NO ADVERTISMENTS - just lots of helpful information with a very easy and relaxing layout - it has a very neighborly feel to it. --- Also - since it only comes bi-monthly, there is just enough time between issues to look forward to the next
I used to think this film was okay but it's really lame. He's going home only cause he wants a car, shows you how greedy people in america are about christmas. They only care about the material goods they get out of the overrated season
This product is the best.  My youngest daughter used it at my home and said she wanted the Margarita, then my oldest daughter said the same.  I like them both equally.  Do follow the directions
When I started reading this book, I began to cry. I saw myself over and over again. And it is so comforting to know I am not the only person feeling this way, hurting this much. I am not quite finished yet, but so far I have learned so much I didn't know and also found suggestions for coping I hadn't encountered. Now if someone could only come up with a cure
I have used Medela's Pump In Style Advance for 4 months now after having my first baby.  This pump is the best in its class and it is the best thing I bought in 2006. ---  --- Why I gave this item 5-star ratings:- ---  --- 1) It helped me to establish a steady milkflow from the 2nd week of breastfeeding.  I am a working mom and had only 8 weeks off from delivery till I have to get back to work again.  So it was important for me to rely on a good breast-pump to keep the supply going.   ---  --- 2) This pump is comfortable to use and I can regulate the speed which is suitable for me.  The Medela parts are easy to set up for usage and also easy to wash & sterilise. ---  --- 3) It never breakdown ever!  For 4 months now, and I'm pumping 4 - 5 times a day.  I bring this unit to the office and also whenever I am travelling.  It is very mobile, although a little heavy to carry. ---  --- 4) It has a battery pack which is handy whenever I am in a place without power-supply. ---  --- 5) I bought this online in Amazon for USD$ 319.  But in Malaysia, this unit would have cost MYR1800 (USD$ 500).   ---  --- Just a note for non-US users (like myself), you need to get an adapter which is compatible with this pump.  This can be easily obtained from any electrical shops. ---  --- This is a good buy, if you're looking for a pump, then you have found it! ---  ---  --- 
This is a good selection of ingredients to start making sushi. It has everything you need except fillings, but there are no instructions. I recommend getting a simple book like Sushi Made Easy to give you the basics. I was pleased with the quality of the ingredients. I might buy this again if I find myself out of everything at once.
I expected more african vocals in it.. thats the main reason i brought the cd, i recently became a fan of that kind of music.. it had like 3 songs on there that i liked, besides that this album is garbag
Worked fine for standard items. Did not handle Partnership issues completely. Would be good to have a preview of the finished return before printed (maybe this is possible, but I did not find this function). --- In general, an easy, straightforward program that gets the job done
As the title suggests Sacred Underworld is pretty much the same as Sacred but a little better.  So if you like Sacred, Sacred Underworld is very well worth playing. 
This live album/in-studio acoustic EP is hard to figure. Most of the live stuff is selected from BLS's "Stronger Than Death" album, which wasn't all that great to begin with. The only good thing being; that album was so poorly mixed that live versions of "All For You" and "13 Years Of Grief" sound much better and immediate than their studio counterparts. A new heavier version of "No More Tears" tries to please, but fails by showing Zakk Wylde's gruff vocals don't always work. Unexpectedly, the bonus acoustic EP is the far better attraction. "Like A Bird" is the best song Neil Young never wrote and "Blood In The Well" shows Zakk's soloing chops in full form. BLS needed some better songs before doing a live record. End of story
I got this puzzle for my three children (age 5, 4, and 2) and within a day my 2 year old had chewed off enough of the little black rubber pieces that the toy no longer worked.  It requires two of them for the vehicles to make sounds, so removing one means it doesn't work.  The pieces are small enough that I wasn't very worried about choking, but why buy a toy which makes you worry?  We were really disappointed.  
I had no trouble with and delay and the pendant looks great, which was a gift for my sister and she loved it
Be careful, this runs REALLY small.  I got the 18-24 for my 14 month old, and it would fit better on an average 6 month old.  Otherwise, it seems of nice quality
I was aniticpatng a riveting documentary... After reading some books on Tibet, I thought this documentary would be especially enlightening. I found it to be slow paced, repetitive and thin on factual information (factual history and an intelligent logical supportable case for the Tibetan side of the Chinese invasion/occupation) and heavy on "experiences and testimonials" of certain Tibetans. The bit about "the American's abandoned us" was un-necessary and somewhat of a turn off. Not that this man felt abandoned (I have the utmost compassion for his experiences), but rather that the editors of this piece opted to include his comments along side the "evil communist Chinese" bits. Overall, this documentary of the Tibetan experience is too heavy on the emotionally charged (I did cry at one point), too repetitive (frankly, it gets boring), and too thin on (non emotionally charged) information.
Amazon never sent the correct order.  I spend 2 hours on the phone trying to get them to send the right item.  I eventually had to decline the order on the 3rd time not getting the correct amount of pop-tarts.  They kept sending once box when i was supposed to get 12
My husband is very pleased with his "self-cleaning" razor, although he didn't like the idea of having to keep purchasing the cleaning solution packs. It's an excellant appliance
Oh Fusion Razor, Fusion Razor, --- Gleaming long and bright. --- Bring to the growth upon my face --- Your buzzing, five-blade might! ---  --- Your contours sleek and overformed, --- Your gripping action steady. --- Your shaving power manifold, --- T'would make a weak mind heady. ---  --- What thoughtfulness lies 'neath your shine? --- You gleam like spaceship rubble! --- And with your "Future Now" design, --- You lay waste to my stubble! ---  --- Too bad you lay waste also to --- The skin beneath the hair. --- Now I bemoan the scabby strokes --- That mar my visage fair. ---  --- Purring like a happy tiger --- That stalks its helpless prey, --- With your five and shining claws, --- My face you swiftly flay. ---  --- Our first few dates were sweet as silk, --- Your touch was oh-so-gentle. --- But by date three you bit and chewed, --- You've proven tempermental. ---  --- Oh, Fusion Razor, Fusion Razor, --- Why have you done me wrong? --- Although you're mighty, it's too bad --- My skin is not as strong. ---  --- Why do I keep on giving you --- A chance to find redemption? --- What razor god hath granted thee --- Such epiderm exemption? ---  --- Oh, no more, no, my razor friend, --- Your doom is clearly written --- By tributaries crimson red --- That on my cheeks you've smitten. ---  --- I wondered when I purchased you, --- Just what the "fusion" meant. --- Now I think it marks the meld --- 'Twixt shaves and punishment. ---  --- "The leading edge of science!" --- "The future is today!" --- "The greatest shave technology!" --- Your advertisements say. ---  --- Technology's not always good. --- Although it's what life's built on, --- It also causes wars and monsters --- (much like Paris Hilton). ---  --- I need no buzzing, layered mesh --- Of steel that swiftly flails. --- I think I'd rather shave myself --- With dull Lee Press-on-Nails. ---  --- So, adieu, my Fusion Razor, --- Don't leave in dour depression. --- Take comfort in that tho' your banned, --- You still left an impression
This is a great exercise ball.  It is great in helping your body tone up by balancing yourself using the ball with various floor routines.  Let me tell you!!!  It is very hard to balance yourself on this ball and I can really feel my muscles working out .  It helps strengthen your muscles and gives you better balance and flexibility.  this is a great  product!!!!!!!!
I worked hard on a VCD project for work using Photo Explosion. I didn't think it was that easy to use, but it was okay until I got ready to burn.  Got a little error message that said something along the lines of "You don't have Nero burners!" No kidding, but there are four other burn programs on my computer. Nothing but Nero would do.  NOWHERE on the box are you informed of this.  It says, and I quote, "Burn CD slideshows you can watch on tv!" Needing more software is never mentioned. As far as I'm concerned, this product makes fraudulent claims.  I will never buy another one of their products
I'm planning a motorcylce trip in Italy this summer and the program gives me all the info I need on routes and sites of intertest along the way.  Overall a great product
I have now seen about twenty Asian horror films, and this series definitely ranks among the best.  I have written more extensive reviews under the individual titles, but suffice it to say that these movies make Audition look like a Disney romance.  Bleak, bizarre, and ultra violent, yet surprisingly stylish and intelligent.  This film maker has something to say, and will beat you senseless to make his point.   ---  --- In short, if you want to see Ringu #25, stay away from this one.  If you feel a bit more adventurous, I highly recommend this series
Since we bought this to work with our Mac, we have had nothing but problems.  If asked to print one page of a document only, it freaks out, all the lights flash and has to be turned off an on again to reset it and calm it down!  Have had long sessions with HP customer service on the phone and they haven't a clue.  If we could have been bothered, we would have taken it back, but just live with the fact that we have to print excess pages (at least we do recycle).  There are various other things that also cause it to freak and flash, can never work out specifically what, we just sigh and reset it.   Will be looking for something else to upgrade to soon
This pirate chest is a total rip off.  The chest is cheaply made and the contents inside are minimal.  When I ordered it as a gift for someone, they sent me someone else's order....then refused to let me return my item for a refund when I finally received it.  The company was very rude and not helpful in the mix up at all. 
This cd its just horrible, they sold only 10,000 copies enough to pay for their instruments lol ! There are better bands than this an example is bleeding through so i think no one cares about a re release peace out
This potty is simple and very easy to clean with only two pieces.  It is also more stable than others we used.  We like it
All you do is put in the batteries and wait about an hour and your clock is at the proper time forever!  No climbing to reset it at daylight savings.
I purchased this baby carrier for my 1-month-old son.  When I put him in it, he looked so uncomfortable.  I tried putting a blanket in there underneath him to prop him up a bit, but it still covered his face.  So, I decided to shell out the $[...] for the infant support pillow, expecting that to make a difference.  It didn't.  He still looked uncomfortable and squished, only now I wasted MORE money. My son is 21 1/2 inces and 11 lbs 4 oz.  I can't imagine how a bigger baby could fit in this at all.  A big disappointment.  If you're looking for a carrier, try the Bjorn.  A million times better than this
This stuff smells just like philosophy's handmade hand cream but not as strong, that's why I took one point off. It has a light, sweet lemon scent with a vanilla background. Of course it's is wonderful as a shampoo and body gell just like all the other philosophy 3-1's. If it where stronger scented it would be my favorite
Had enough of cheap looking patio umbrellas that tear and bend after 3 or so thunderstorms?  Try this one!  Very nice design,looks great, simulated wood finish pole, easy open and close. We are very satisfied
Better just to throw it away rather than saddle someone with a mistake I made. Thank goodness, it was not costly...do not waste your money on this toy tuner...this tuner is not sensitive enough for any use at all..Cannot buy a worthwhile, more costly instrument? Go to Guitarplayersclub.com, a site Fender put up for ama and pro players alike....there is a tuner there, FREE that comes very close to the expensive one...Exception? No where to put your quarter.....
This jacket is wind and water resistant, but not waterproof.  I was soked through after first rain. I use it mainly for wind block while biking now
The fabric is a little stiff at first, bust softens to a acceptable level after a few washes. The elastic band around the waist of these boxers contracts to the point where it wrinkles up the fabric. After a few hours of wear you have the indents of the crinkled up band on your skin and it feels quite uncomfortable. While cheap and nicely packaged, these things suck. Spend some money on decent underwear
Proving that there's life in the old dog yet, Bushnell have come up with this, the successor to the out-dated, poor-performing Trophy Splashproof Spotting Scope, and I have to say, it's a fantastic improvement. As soon as I took it out of the box I was impressed with its styling, shape, colour, and of course, waterproofness. I set it up in my front room and spent a happy couple of hours watching my neighbours coming and going, and they were oblivious to my surveillance. It's not the most subtle 'scope out there but stick a blanket over your head and you're laughing. Any one who has been caught out in the rain will appreciate this little beauties moulded plastic housing, as water really does roll off it like, erm, water off a duck's back. Stunning
That's all I could think of when my family and I sat down to watch this movie together.  We had told the story to our children about the miraculous staircase built without nails in a small chapel in Santa Fe.  The story itself is so powerful and moving. Built in the 1870s, the chapel was nearly complete when it became apparent the choir loft stairs would not fit. The sisters' prayed a novena to St. Joseph and on the ninth day their prayers were answered when a mysterious carpenter arrived, built the "miraculous" staircase, and then disappeared without being paid. The staircase is a double helix with no visible support. It's 23 feet tall and makes two 360 degree spirals, and the wood used is not a known wood in any area near Santa Fee! ---  --- This movie however is about a mother superior who has faith but harbors real resentment towards Indians and also likes to curse (how this has anything to do with the actual story I still have no idea!).  At one point when a nun is "shocked" to hear mother curse mother surperior responds "Oh Margret get off the cross and get down here with the rest of us".  When the mysterious carpenter shows up and starts to build the staircase, the architect and the contractor decide that this is a bad thing and threaten to kill the carpenter.  Meanwhile this carpenter who is sent by "God" builds the staircase with wood that doesn't work, is arrested after being falsly accused of attempted murder, and leaves everyone to believe vandalls destroyed the staircase when in fact he originally destroyed it before rebuilding it better.  In the end the staircase is built and this mother superior (who is on death's door) is so moved that she literally crawls up the staircase in a very "weird"/"uncomfortable" scene until she reaches the choir loft and dies.  Wow, inspiring. --- The best thing I could think of is this director and writer took a wonderful and moving story and turned it into a Hollywood flop. This was obviously written, directed, and produced by people who have no idea how the staircase was built but are pretty darn sure it wasn't a miracle because hey, miracles just don't happen. The acting was pretty good but the story was junk.  Unfortunately I bought this movie.   ---  --- If you are looking for a true inspirational movie that you can watch with your family, rent or buy Mother Theresa with Olivia Hussey.  Hands down the best Saints movie every filmed.  Half way through the movie my 5 year old says out loud "Wow, she REALLY cares about everybody!"  Inspirational movie, compared to this disappointment
I guess I must have had the same mindset as Adam in the previous review.  I too set up the main unit and the remote side by side to see if the readings from both units would agree, along with another very accurate digital thermometer.  After six hours, the temperature readings from all of the units were within one degree, but the humidity readings from the remote unit were lower by 4 to 8 percent as compared the humidity reading from the main unit... which is 3 to 7 percent too much IMO since they were side by side.  What good is having a relative humidity function if you cannot trust the readings?  I will return the unit. ---  --- Also, on my unit, the front wood bezel apparently had a small defect and it was repaired (from the factory) with a wood filler type material... but the defect was still obvious
We live in a city and we got a minor ding on the side of the car. We bought this kit a few years ago somewhere other than Amazon (think a auto store). Anyway we did what it said and did it several times. It did take some of the ding out but not all of it. We barely got the glue off from it. A few years later we got hit by a suv when we were getting the car fixed we had the guy remove the ding and now it looks perfect. Sadly this thing was not worth the money or effort we put into it. I also watched Fox 5 and they tested the item it didn't work for them either. I know it will cost more but take it to a auto shop and get the ding removed there. Don't buy this product it is worthless.
I had the good fortune to tour the Richeson Easel Factory. I was truly impressed! Incredible craftsmanship, attention to detail, and as I came to find out, service oriented. I would never buy a different brand after seeing what went into it. Extra note: They use Lyptus wood. As hard as oak, but a renewable resource. When you buy one, it tells you all about it. Really fine easels
more of a novelty than a useful flashlight. need to shake it a lot to get a charge and even then the emitted light is too low to be useful. the switch has also broken and we havent even used the flashlight more than a couple times...would not recommend buying this flashlight, trying to return mine.
I was hoping that they were a little larger in size and not as thick. However, I think it's a decent buy for only $30.00 I bought this as a stocking stuffer for my girlfriend. It comes packaged in a beautiful velvet blue box thats almost big enough to fit a watch. Very clean presentation when you open it up. The white gold really shines. The free shipping was FAST...and I do mean quick. I ordered this late at night and it arived the very next day. I've never had a quicker shipment for free before. If your looking for a great deal on white gold earings, I think you've found it
Maybe I'm bias because I really like Yamaha, maybe, because I have kinda' good ears or, it's the fat check sitting on my table  from Yamaha; but what ever it is I realllllllly like this sub-woofer. ---  ---  I looked around a long time for the right sub, and, I like to think I got a good one here. ---  You want power? Ok, it's only 250 watts -not 1,000 watts like Velodyne, but in my room (30 by 18ish with a 25 foot ceiling) it ROCKS. ---   --- I love music, all kinds; loud or quiet no matter I like both, but I do like depth more than volume. However, I believe if you are going to listen to something real loud, being able to feel the music is as important as being able to here it. --- And let me say you can FEEL music if you want to. ---  one of the things I love most about this sub is it's range; it can (maybe) reach 20 hertz. 20 hertz! that is astounding. --- 20Hz is the lowest frequency the human ear can hear, in fact it's starting into the range of sounds that are felt more than heard. ---  --- Maybe I have good ears and maybe I don't, but to hear rich airy low-end, and, bass notes. yes! bass NOTES! bass is not one big boomy lump of noise, it's huge, open, grazing pasture of distinct sounds! ---  --- In short, music sounds great, even hip-hop (which I don't like) sounds, well, better. --- Also, their is no need to turn the volume way up to hear a improvement; at very quiet levels too, you can hear good clean bass notes. But, if you do a lot of quite listening, we're talking back ground music levels: disable the auto-on feature and manually turn it on and off, because if you happen to be listening to something quiet, even if you still can here low notes from this, it does not seem to be enough signal to keep the auto-on, well... on. ---   --- It improves movies as well, take something  with a lot of dynamics like, "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" or, "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" there are a lot of sudden loud, and very low sounds in those movie's and the Yamaha handles it all with aplomb. ---   --- With most of the controls are on the front set-up is and tweaking is made easy, and if you are wondering about the "BASS" button: if the button is in the "music" position you will have to turn the volume to a higher level to shake the termites out of the walls than if its set to the "movie" position (I think "music" is a flatter frequency response). ---  As this review seems to be getting a bit long I'll some it up: --- yes, there are far better subwoofers out there (like from B&W), but I don't have the money for those, and if someone gave me a 1,000 watt Velodyne I would take it in a heartbeat- but, I wouldn't want to give this one up too. --- It's a absolute pleasure to listen to. ---  ---  --- Update: I have run some test tones on this subwoofer, and well, it can not reach 20Hz. 38Hz seems to be the limit for usable bass, although it is still audible to around 32Hz, 20Hz is a stretch. --- If 38Hz sounds to high: their are not many movie's or CD's that have any sounds below 35Hz. And very, very few have sound below 25Hz. --- Although it does not go as low as I would have hoped, it is still a good sub for the money, and still worth a five star review
I love this grill just last night i made pizza on it for the first time it's got a awesome amount of cooking space for such a portable grill. it's great we use it on our patio all the time. --- the build quality is great and it's very easy to clean --- i think they even added some vents into the design so the airflow is awesome... --- and with amazons free shipping you cant find a better deal anywhere
I use Adobe Acrobat Professional extensively both as an attorney and as a researcher/author.  Because of the new features advertised which would enhance Acrobat storage of PowerPoint presentations, I bought it off the shelves at a local Staples office supply dealer.  I am proficient at my own installations and expected no trouble on this.  It acted like a virus.  The program did not finish installing.  Worse yet, it corrupted the underlying 7.0 installation and fixed that so the Windows Controller program could not install it. I had to hack through the registry to remove traces of it.  Finally I got to a stage where it appeared to be going through the registry process again.  Then I received the coup de grace -- a BAD SERIAL NUMBER MESSAGE.  I checked carefully and it matched the serial number exactly as on the label sent by Adobe inside its factory package.  I used MicroSoft OneNote to make a colored screen copy of this phenonema and marched the package back to Staples where they refunded my money.  It's too bad about the 20 plus billable hours as a lawyer lost to this process.  My experiences in calling Adobe in the past when I puzzled through a far lesser discourage me from wanting to talk to their technical support people (who too often know less than me given the increasingly apparent out-sourcing to people who read from a script and give us credit for knowing far less than we do).  At any rate, I am now bitter.  My 7.08 installation of Adobe worked great on my favorite computer where I had the bulk of my multimedia presentations which I hoped to reduce complete with sounds to the Adobe 8.0 format.  I suspect that wrong serial numbers were slapped on the packages.  I am deeply disappointed, even ANGRY at the inconvenience this has caused me.  I took it home and tried it on my desktop there and it also would not complete the installation and ruined my chances of a clean uninstallation of 7.0.  Deactivation of 7.0 could not take place either after installation of 8.0.  I don't know what Adobe was thinking -- or if they were thinking.  I have been a loyal customer of theirs for many years, but I'm thinking distinctly non-charitable thoughts about them this early morning.  I hope they get their act together -- soon.  They owe us all a quick fix and patch and they need DEEP REPENTANCE for the damage this did to Windows XP home installations which also appear to be corrupted in the process of installing this "upgrade" program which acts more like a computer worm or virus than a program
Was very dissapponted with this magazine.  They go unread and get thrown out.  Just waiting for our subscription to run out. --- It is really for older kids and of very little interest to younger kids
The first film was much better than R.E. Apocalypse; more gore, better acting, better presentation overall, and it was done with a lot less money
Great Music, Great band. This is a must buy. Recommended to all hard rock lovers
Baby has had less gas and fussiness since we have been using these bottles.  Quick cleanup, quick fill up.  Love the nipple variety too.   ---  --- Because of the liners, it is easy to keep two of these bottles in use and not clutter up the kitchen with bottle pieces, etc. ---  --- Would highly recommend
These earrings just arrived, and for $10 (Friday sale), you cannot beat this value.  Luckily I bought two pair, one as a gift, and one for me, on the off chance I liked them.  Otherwise, I thought, I could hold the second pair for one of my granddaughters.  No way; the second pair is mine
The book was long and boring. To many and way to much descriptive details. I regret ever purchasing the book. Had to really fight with my self to finish the book. I'm glad it's over
This was a great buy, Item was as described. A++++++++++
the problem is I have more than one guitar this one is my least favorite. P.S. has bad soun
I put the sensor out my backdoor in a shady area about 30 feet from the main unit in the kitchen.  One screw attaches each item.  It has three channels.  It'll memorize the high and low indoor and outdoor temperature. ---  --- The display is large enough to read from several feet away.  It's been installed for several months of silent, dependable, and accurate temperature monitoring.
This spice is impossible to find at a local market. I was so happy to find it on line. It arrived quickly and was fresh and authentic. I will certainly order again!
The cord-wrapped handle is a great idea, offering more of a real sword-like look as well as a firmer grip. My hands tend to get sweaty and slip around a bit with long practice, particularly with the sealed lacquered finish on most bokken. This wrap really helps (though it needed a touch of glue to get it to stay in place). The two-piece guard design is a nice enhancement too. Though you really don't need the guard at all for many applications it is nice looking and appears stronger than the original. ---  --- It's still a fairly cheap piece of wood, compared to an ironwood version, but at this price (it was $9.99 when I bought it) you really can't go wrong. A nice enhancement over the basic bokken. I do, however, prefer the natural wood version to this one as it looks pretty bad once you start using it and the color scrapes off. Nevertheless, if you want an inexpensive practice sword this one is recommended...
Worked alright for a few months.  I wasn't especially pleased with the shave quality i.e. skin irritation, hair pulls.  I figured that this would go away as I was transitioning from a straight electric shaver to one with rotary heads.  It didn't.   ---  --- The bigger disappointment was that removing the head for cleaning out hair wasn't easy and resulted in breakage, no doubt due to the cheap plastic used.  Never again
This was a present on our girls 3rd birthday... She rode off an on from 2 until 9 She loved it so much we couldn't wait for the battery to run out. For the rest of the day she would only stop long enough open another gift then back to the car.  Quick to learn how to drive it... Loud?? a little bit but hey, it's a kids toy.  If they didn't make noise, the kids wouldn't like it. --- Great Toy!! Great Value!
I use this conditioner as well as the other pumpkin products. Having bleached hair, I didn't think I'd have healthy looking and feeling hair until I discovered these products. They are worth their weight in gold!  They leave my hair soft,manageable and healthy looking and the smell is wonderful
There are precious few magazines out there for the military historian with the appeal that this one has.  The illustrations are stunning and complement the well-written and informative text month after month.  One of my favorite magazines and a must-have for the military historian
These are beautiful small earrings, just what I was looking for.  They're exactly as described, 11mm inside diameter.  I used the super-saving shipping and was surprised at how quickly they arrived.  I'm very pleased with the entire transaction
this product is a mess. i cant believe it actually sterilizes bottles and nipples i ended up having to wash them and boil the old fashioned way it builds up nasty mineral deposits and it lets water out when you pick up the lid it really is flushing 50$ down the drain you need a whole role of bounty paper towels to clean after this jun
I was so excited when I ordered my Star Wars Holographic Emperor figure. I'd been waiting for this exclusive figure be available for weeks!! When I got home today, the box with the Amazon logo was on my doorstep. Upon opening the box, I was completely disappointed to find that the Emperor figure I'd been waiting for was damaged since it was jammed into the box so that the backing card was crushed. The people packing this stuff are half-wits!! Anybody with a brain would know better than to  cram something into a box like that!! They should be ashamed of their service & to all you collectors out there....BEWARE!!
i am very happy with Microsoft Office 2004.  It is easy to install the software. I am using the whole suite of products successfully and easily.  Thank you Bill Gates (and Steve Jobs!)! 
This is the second batch I ordered. I have had to contact representatives at BrucePac both times to complain about the quality of the product and they have kindly send me replacement jerky. I have enjoyed the same World Kitchen Jerky from other vendors so I cannot understand why the order from Amazon has been such a disappointment.
This is in excellant condition and came in a timely manner
This item was shipped quickly and on time.  It stands out, not the same-old, same-old zip-up hoodie.  Would recommend this seller and item-(to any yankee fan).  Thanks for reading.  =
I bought this seat for my fifth child. She loved it at first, but then about the second week we had it, the plastic at the top of one of the legs snapped as I was putting her in it. Luckily I had not let go of her yet, because the whole thing fell apart on the floor.  The rattle ball also broke off within the first couple of weeks.  Upon investigation, the company only offers a 15 day warranty and that does not cover "material failure". I will not buy anything else from this company.  Not only are their products poor they are down right dangerous
Okay, I am no Master Gardener, but then, this is not a product for a Master Gardener. I am also not wanted for botanicidal rampages. I bought this right after it first came on the market, did everything according to the instructions, found the perfect spot, etcetera, etcetera. About ten percent, if that, of the seeds sprouted, turned into little green shoots . . . and died. This herb garden is marketed as simple, follow-the-steps, sit-back-and-watch-it-grow. Not in my Universe! The only thing I admire about Chia Pet, Incorporated (or whatever the parent company might be named) is their skill at marketing. Each holiday season, as their commercials flourish, I am tempted. Then, I recall the Great Disaster of 1999, and I resist temptation
This was terrible. I returned after hours with tech support and days of email exchanges with Apple Support Desk.  ---  --- The product will probably be better with future software updates, but in my experience, it was fairly unreliable in its current state. Examples of problems: wouldn't download drm managed content online, had problems when downloading itunes purchased music (the first time I've had that problem in 4 years of ipods and itunes), couldn't connect to my corporate VPN, and finally, just as evidence of the lack of QA on this device, the included instruction manuals were for the previous version of the Apple Extreme. The images were of the previous white, button-shaped device. ---  --- This was a genuine disappointment, and it seemed to stem from bad software and bad QA.  Others seem to have had more success, but I'm back on my 802.11g airport extreme and all problems have magically disappeared
This is a great watch. The clasp is easy to adjust and takes only 10 minutes to adjust. It was shipped well before the estimated time and is in perfect condition. Well made and light, it's extremely slim. SO if you really like heavy watches, this may not be your choice. Otherwise it is perfect for everyone
I like the 05 version better. Sure this has updated playing rosters and the new quarterback function, but it doesn't appear to me EA sports have evolved much over the last 12 months or even few years for that matter. I was expecting the graphics to be better and the gameplay to feel more real but maybe I was expecting too much. I won't buy the 07 when it comes out, I'll wait and see what they can do with it on Playstation 3
I bought this to monitor the evening outdoor temperature. When it finally cools off enough outside, I turn the air conditioner off and run just the fan on fresh air. This was simple to set up and seems to work flawlessly. I like that a change in temperature registers very quickly in tenths of a degree
It fits in the S1, but it doesn't always charge -- the contacts arent the same size as the OEM version.  When it doesn't charge I just re-insert the batter and it works, but its sort of a bummer
Just be careful when using it in tinted windows. They filter out the sun and the motor doesn't spin
Another unspeakable album from the most unspeakably overwrought, over-produced and over-rated rock band of all time.  Did I mention over the top? Let's face it, Queen was a group of crypto-fascists, working hard to put a human face on Thatcherism.  Ghastly stuff. ---  --- K.
These bras do not hold up very well. I started wearing them in June after the birth of my son and I have already had to throw both of them away - six months later
These earrings are very pretty-- not too big not too small, just right.  For the price you can't go wrong.  The gift box they arrived in was sort of cheesy, but they were for ME so I didn't mind.  If I were giving them as a gift I'd put them in a prettier box before giving them to the recipient. ---  --- Overall very pretty earrings, good value, no complaints
Unfortunately, there seemed to be no recourse after I ordered this for 2 newphews as a Christmas gift, and it did not arrive.  I tried to send an email to amazon.com but got bumped to someone else (distributor?) who never responded.  So disappointing since it was a gift for someone else.  Happened not once, but twice
Have a one year subscription to this magazine and will not renew it. Simply because its vulgar materialism to the extreme.  They say we Americans are obese in body, but magazines like this show to many are also obese when it comes to materialism.  Page after page of glossy ads for things we do NOT need.  And rooms to full of what amounts to dust collections.  Sure they make pretty pictures, but who wants all that 'junk' that probably has no real sentimental value but is more what someone else has told us we need to feel whole or successful.  I recommend the magazine Dwell which has a more holistic approach to a place to live that also wont mean hours cleaning.  For someone who professes to be so concerned about the down trodden, Oprah would do better to set a better example of living simply. And how many homes does one American need, when so many Americans cannot afford even one
My title says it all. A perfect blend of salty and sweet. Best of both worlds
This was a gift . It came on time and was half the price of one we had looked at . So we were happy 
This is an okay jacket. The padding in it is okay. Sizes tend to run a little smaller than normal. There is no liner, and you will get cold riding at night. Overall the jacket has only 2 layers, and if you hold it in front of you you can see through the mesh. Spend a little bit more and get something that will hold up
It is a great product and makes my husband's face as smooth as a baby's you know............................
The case fit well, but only lasted me a few days before the top started to crack apart. I'm very gentle with my phone, but the little pieces of plastic that hold the cover on the side started to pop off one by one. It no longer stays on so I threw it away. THe bottom is still on great, but it dosn't do me any good without a top!
I am extremely happy with this purchase!  I LOVE the 10x zoom when taking pics of my kids
I've been using Murad for about 3 weeks now, and it has made a huge difference! I am in my early 20's and have had problems with mild breakouts since my teens. I've tried drugstore products, wich never seemed to make any difference, and Proactive which was so harsh it actually burned and made my skin much worse. Murad is gentle enough for me to use twice a day, and has left my skin breakout free! It has also improved the texture and feel of my skin, and makes my pores nearly invisible. I recomend Murad to anyone whose skin is breakout prone but too sensitive for the benzoyle peroxide formulas in other acne products. The only complaint I have about Murad is the price - it can be a little much for a poor college student - but the results are worth it if you can afford it!
I agree with the other reviews.  My four year old received the ranch as a birthday gift - none of the pieces stay together - at all.  How do you explain why the gate won't hold together - why the horse won't stand up, why the barn doors keep falling off - and what do I say to the gift giver when they see it
My son loves to read, and he adores this book.  I personally love Trapani's books--while they are not always grammatically correct (the only reason why I don't give it a 5 star rating), they are beautifully  illustrated and bring to life some of the most well-known nursery rhymes.   It will bring a smile to your child's face
I was very pleased with the Quality of this blend, it contained the exact amount of sumac. It makes a perfect rub for Lamb. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the small amount for the price
I purchased this after reading the reviews. I had never heard of it, let alone tested it. I had some gift certificates & thought I'll be impulsive. ~ When I first opened it I thought "oh no, this is going to be heady (or strong)".. but it seemed to 'change within seconds upon application, and got even better as it settled. My daughter wears vera wang princess, and she, too, loves Lolita. It's my newest fav & a possible signature scent for me. Will def. buy again
I wouldn't recommend this movie, unless you have nothing else to do for the night and want to watch it alone. Due to a high content of bad words, screaming and violence, it's kind of embarrassing watching it with someone else. Some people really enjoyed it, and that's not me, and that's not the other two people I know who watched it. Some violent parts are a bit hard to believe, but I guess that's what the story is about. This movie is a bit of a hollywood-style suspense, with rather cheesy college scenes that are common to comedies.  ---  --- There's one good idea in this movie and that's how life develops as it goes along, and one action or inaction changes how life plays out. But this is no where near original, even the Simpsons had an episode like that.  ---  --- So, this movie is definitely not on my best movies list.
If, like myself, you have many DX and VST plug-ins installed on your system, then Audition 2.0 is definitely NOT the choice with you.  Somehow, the idiots who made this junk have made it completely incompatible with 3rd-party plugs such as Waves Diamond Bundle.  Oddly enough, this was not a problem in earlier editions of Audition, or its former incarnation, CoolEdit.  But now, Audition crashes irrevocably when trying to use many VST and DX plugs (except, of course, the ones made by Adobe themselves.) ---  --- Bottom line?  This software is crap.  Absolute crap.  If you're serious about audio production, go with Wavelab.  Heck, even free multitrack audio software like Kristal works better than this. ---  --- If, for some reason, you absolutely need Audition, then go with an earlier, more stable version, such as 1.5. ---  --- 2.0 is about as useful as a football bat. ---  
Following on from the fantastic 'The Duel' Allison Moorer's latest release 'Getting Somewhere' is a massive, massive  disappointment. --- Quite simply the material on 'Getting Somewhere' is weak and gutless.  --- On the rare occasions Moorer tries to emulate the beauty and feel of 'The Duel' - such as on Hallelujah & New Years Day - Earle rips the heart out of the material with such an amateurish, pedestrian and thin production that you feel cheated ! Business and pleasure rarely mix and Moorer should take a long, hard look at this release and give serious consideration to re-installing RS Field next time around. ---  --- If Moorer wants a guitar groove that burns , drums that drive and vocals that mesmerise then Earle is simply not the man for the job. ---  --- Moorer is a fantastic talent who has one of the finest female voices of any genre (she can write a mean song too ! ) . This CD showcases none of her abilities and should be consigned to the bargain bins immediately
Podría ser extraño regalar una prenda de ropa íntima, pero estos Boxer son lo máximo para regalar desde un primo hasta a un compañero de estudios, y claro para la pareja - e incluso para chicas. Son de algodón, muy suaves frescos y ligeros. Los compré talla M y auqnue son para un caballero delgado uno M de Medio llenito los puede usar con comodidad. Para mi gusto son un poco largos, pero eso también provee de comodidad a su usuario. esto es más que una prenda de ropa interior es algo que provoca lucir y ver lucir. El estampado fue toda una celebración "Saluda a mi pequeño amigo"!!!!!!, con este Boxer puedes pasearte en interiores en tu casa y a nadie le va a molestar
Based on lots of great reviews, I decided to buy Kaspersky.  After two months, I got a message saying my activation key was blacklisted.  I sent an email to customer service and got an auto reply saying they were too busy to respond within 48 hours.  Finally after three days someone got back to me and told me to try deleting and reentering the key.  This did not work.  I had to reply again to customer service and got the same auto reply. This time, no one ever replied.  I sent another email threatening to write negative reviews of them and they still, weeks later, have not replied.  I emphatically advise against buying this product.  If you ever have a problem, you will not get help
I read Les Miserables after I saw the opera, and it has inspired in me more than any book I've ever read.  I don't believe one could ever find a better novel anywhere.  For everyone out there--read this now!!  There is a character that will touch everyone, no matter what type of person you are.  This novel is easy to relate to, and exciting.  It also give some insight to the unwritten history of the revolutions in France during Napolean's time.  I recommend strongly to everyone to read this book, and see the opera.  It really will effect your life
I just love my little Parrot!  The kids on the bike trail love to hear it too
I was very disappointed that the version of "Paper Roses" included on this CD is an updated and new recorded version from 1990.  It is not the original 1973 classic Marie recorded when she was twelve.Interestingly, this new version is produced by Sonny James, the original producer of the original single, that also features many of the original studio musicians.  So all is not lost. Still, I prefer the original hit version and am disappointed there was no indication that this CD included an updated "Paper Roses.&quot
I purchased two scarves and in the first washing the thread in the hems unraveled, producing a ragged fringe all around.  These bandanas are thin, flimsy, and not worth the time or money
This unit is a workhorse for the money. I use it on my Corvette in the winter and in the summer I have my snowblower attached to the battery tender. This product is compact in size and simple to use. It came with different adapters that enabled use with different battery charging requirements. ---  --- I recently gifted a unit to my father in-law who leaves 2 cars in Florida year round. ---  --- A must have for anyone who has a vechicle or seasonal piece of equipment. --- 
There's not a lot of information out there on using this extractor for cars, because I think most people buy it for boats instead.  So I'm going to talk about how well it works on changing the oil in your car. ---  --- In summary, it works great.  It's really nice being able to change your oil on your own time and at your own home without getting dirty.  I'm never going to Jiffy Lube again.  It even works great on my lawnmower. ---  --- Using the extractor is very easy.  Just remove your dipstick, insert the extractor's tube into the dipstick hole until the end reaches the bottom of the oil pan (it might take some practice to get a feel for this part).  Once everything is in place, pump 10-20 times.  This will cause a the extractor to suck out the oil like a straw.  It takes about 15 minutes for 3 quarts.  That's also why I recommend the 6-liter model instead of the 2.5-liter one, so that you can suck out all the oil in one shot. ---  --- Some people wonder whether all of the oil is removed this way.  Unfortunately, I can't really speak to that, because that would require me to open the drain plug and investigate.  However, the consensus from stuff I've read on the Internet is that the extractor does remove as much oil as the traditional method. ---  --- Because changing my oil is so easy with the extractor, I always change my oil on time.  Previously, I drove for thousands of miles past my "due date" because stopping for an oil change was too inconvenient.  The extractor should be used after the engine has been running.  The oil is less viscous and the contaminants are stirred up, making the extractor more effective. ---  --- Also, please remember that your old oil must be properly recycled.  Most mechanic shops will accept your old oil (I put it in a plastic orange juice container), just call ahead to make sure
My copy of "Reckless Nights..." (and yours, too, probably) has a sticker on front that reads: "One of the Most Influential Musicians of the 20th Century."  Well, I'm so glad that Columbia cleared that up.  Otherwise, I'd have had to make up my OWN mind, and apparently music labels don't allow that nowadays.  I hope similar stickers are included on Chopin, Mozart, and Bach CDs (with the century adjusted on a per-composer basis). ---  --- Scott's gimmicky fare makes for pleasant listening, but not in such a large dose--monotony sets in after two or three titles, let alone 22. Halfway through this CD, I felt as if I were listening to the drone of a defrosting icebox.  For all the outrageous hyperbole thrown at Scott--no one else like him, no way to categorize his music, and so on, and so on--the reality is that composers and arrangers like Ferde Grofe, Duke Ellington, Glenn Miller, Alec Templeton, and Bill Challis covered the same ground far more skillfully--and, in most instances, earlier--than Scott.  Concert jazz, symphonic jazz, or whatever you wish to call it, was NOT the invention of any one man, and certainly not Scott.  Check out Grofe's scores for Whiteman--in particular, his writing for woodwinds and his constant, Scott-esque use of muted trumpet.  Listen to Duke Ellington's "extended" compositions circa 1929.  For that matter, listen to Ellington's 1933 "Daybreak Express"--virtually the template for Scott's galloping miniatures.  Experience Bill Challis and Glenn Miller's pioneering big band charts.  Or... believe as you're told to believe, i.e. that Scott, and Scott alone, performed this kind of music.  I mean, who needs history when we've got hype?  It's up to YOU, dear listener
I bought BHG Deluxe 7.0 software to plan an addition. I talked to the companies and shopped around before purchasing. I did not talk to IMSI about floor plan 3D, I gave up after trying to get through to a human. I would bet a guess the software is as good as IMSI's telephone skills. I talked to Punch Software and was warned away from their product by their own tech as I have integrated video on my computer. Apparently you need a video card with a minimum of video memory to render drawings with any usable speed using punch software. Punch Software's loss, not mine as that's a ridiculous issue for a consumer software product. Chief Architect offered a money back guarantee for their Better Homes and Gardens products, even if purchased via vendors like amazon. I'll keep this better homes and gardens home designer deluxe software, even though it does have it's annoying quirks. Even for a lesser package from the pro version, the library of items it very limited. I would guess there are quite a few more in the pro version, but it is odd to not include more of the most standard items that many home owners would need when laying out a home. You learn to just use a nearly matched symbol to fill the space, even though it is not the correct symbol or size of item. Since I am not interested in the 3D view, this is not a big issue for me. The item I needed most was floorplanning. 3D modeling is an extra item that I may play with, but is not essential for me personally. If you are truly interested in the 3D aspect, this is an issue. I would recommend visiting the product forum to see what is the best choice. [...]  For quick and easy floor plan software with a few extras, this software does better than OK. No experience necessary, and the short tutorial videos will get you started quickly. I have issues with not being able to have more control of wall types, and there are some odd roof design limitations even for a mid to low priced consumer package. These are annoying enough to urge an upgrade to pro if you want more  control of all aspects. Since I will be laying out the floor plan, then turning it over to an architect with real softare, it's not a problem for me. I have had a few restarts due to drawings getting all wild and messed up, but by ignoring the autosaved drawings, I was able to go back to my last manually saved drawing and start from a known good point. This software does have upgrade options to download from the company site. Just like any good software company, they do provide spftware patches to download. I would definately recommend this software as a quick way to do floor plans. Adding walls, doors, windows, and other items is very simple. Just don't plan on perfection, as it's based on prefabbed walls and is limited to whole inches, not fractions. Angles are an issue as well. If you need specific angles, this is not the package, it does preset increments only. I wish it had default preferences a user could select as well. Being able to preset your roofing style preferences or other items would eliminate quite a bit of redo's. I hope the software companies read these reviews. There is alot of good information on how to improve the products.    
I tend to like just about anything that Brubaker writes.  While I'm not as excited about his Marvel work as most others are, I have enjoyed his runs on Captain America and Daredevil.  His work outside of Marvel has been great; Sleeper is one of my favorite series over the last few years.  In general, Brubaker had not written anything that I genuinely disliked.  Then came 'Deadly Genesis'. ---  --- In short, this is a weak story with several plot holes which makes a mockery of a franchise that already has a history of reworking established continuity to poor results.  To what end?  Another Summers brother who is completely disinteresting, another story in which Professor X acts like a jerk, a dead X-Men (for absolutely no good reason), and some horrible reworking of existing long running history to cram it all in which now require secrets to have been kept by several key characters for the last 30 years. ---  --- I want to think that this story was driven by editorial mandate.  Unfortunately, this is the second instance in which Brubaker has went back and altered Marvel history from long ago.  In Captain America, he made it so that Bucky never really died in World War II.  This initially rubbed me the wrong way, but the story itself was done well, and the surrounding plots were good, so I begrudgingly went along for the ride.  I was still able to enjoy his entire run on the book. ---  --- His attempt to revise history doesn't work nearly as well here.  The key difference is that Bucky had been considered dead for so long that there was very little continuity to adjust.  He hadn't been written into any stories during all that time, so it was very easy to go and insert an alternate history for him.  In 'Deadly Genesis', Brubaker inserts events into key storylines from 30 years ago.  In order for them to work, the reader needs to believe that several key characters has kept these events a secret from that time forward.  It just doesn't work. ---  --- To make matters worse, none of the characters' motivation for anything makes any sense at all.  Characters are keeping secrets, and other characters are upset with that, and through the whole you never understand why.  It's as if Brubaker had an end goal in mind, and simply crammed in any plot device necessary to get from point A to point B - even if it required characters to act contrary to their nature or the story didn't make complete sense. ---  --- That aside, another difference between the two is simply that this series is not written as well as Captain America.  They overall plot doesn't make complete sense and the characters are presented fairly shallowly.  Reading it was more of a chore than an act of enjoyment. ---  --- The interior art is nice, though not great.  Unfortunately, the book falls so short on story alone that the art warrants almost no consideration
I have been using Lush products for a few years now. First introduced to them when I was in Australia. --- I always keep some in my linen closet as it gives a faint wonderful scent to all the sheets and pillowcases. ---  --- Try all of the bath bombs. I use the Tisty Tosty whenever I need an evening of self indulgence. Put the water on and watch the heart-shaped bomb fizzle and send hundreds of rose petals floating to the top of the tub. --- Put some fluffy bath towels to warm on a rail. --- Place some Dr Haushka's oil to heat by a radiator. --- Pour a glass of champagne. --- Surround the tub with lots of  tea lights. --- Put on some Rahman music. --- Get in and imagine a private Ganges. --- When you get out its very eassy to scoop up the petals- take the pre-warmed towels and wrap yourself in one. ---  ---  By then the oils will be warm and pour in palm of hand and rub on body.  --- I also like to put some  bath bombs in guest bedrooms with the towels-  --- If you haven't tried the Karma soap do try it ......alone or with someone special..
This is a great value for money and it is very silent and soen not get hot.  It is also silent and convenient.  It is more flexible with the FAT 32 format it comes in but I preferred the NTFS file format whice is safer and more stable.  It was no problem to reformat to NTFS
old mac usr, new mac usr, matters not.  there is something in this magazine for everyone.  and, icreate has a pretty good online usr forum too.
I have gone through several smartphones in the past 4 months (Including, Cingular HTC 8125, and Nokia E62)  and can safely say that this is the best phone I have owned.   The Palm operating system is much easier to use than the Windows operating system ( albeit, less powerful) and much more customizable and synchronization-friendly than the Symbian OS.  Its great for easy installation of software. ---  --- Pros: --- - Very customizable interface, making the phone very user friendly. You can set any application or any number to dial as a preset button.  --- - Palm OS is easy to use, and thus, you actually get to take advantage of the many features of the phone, unlike Windows Mobile, which is definantly more powerful than Palm OS, but cumbersome and difficult to use at times.  --- - You can use this as a one handed phone...very important for people like me who like to drive and text/email.  --- - Perfect size, weight and feel of the phone in your hand and on your ear.  --- The lack of the antennae stub on this model is a huge aesthetic improvement. --- -  Easy synchronization with your Outlook mailbox or with the Palm Desktop  --- - Can set the phone to automatically retrieve your emails and alert you, which is very useful  (although limits battery life)  ---  ---  --- Cons: --- - Battery life is somewhat worse than other phones.  I have to charge my phone every night, and I probably use about 15 minutes of internet, 30 minutes of mp3 player, autoretrieve email every 30 min,  and 2 hour talk time as well as some other Palm functions.    If you have it set on auto-retrieve for your email, the battery life seems to decrease impressively.    The newer manufactured 680s have a fix installed for this problem apparently. --- - You cant plug in your own headsets into the device ( like your iPod headphones)  you have to use a specific headphone that fits and you can get it from Palm. I hate that.  ---  ---  ---  --- I suggest buying this phone unlocked from Palm, instead of from Cingular.  I got it for 350$  with a 1G SD card and stereo headphones included. Also,  if you get it from Cingular, they always ruin the look of the phone by plastering their logo all over both sides of the phone.   ---  --- OVERALL:  extremely satisfied with this easy to use, highly customizable, powerful smartphone, despite a somewhat shorter battery life.  ---  --- 
This is a great product for the money. For a novice, it was easy to use. The instructions were pretty thin but it was simple to figure out. A useful tool
I've been using this directional mic for almost three years and have never noticed camera noise. It's compact and provides a good reach for most ambient sound situations
This item arrived on time and the quality was great. This bodysuit makes a great gift idea for "baby" - it's just how I expected it would be
my husband looooved it from the moment he opened the box. excellent quality. looks very expensive.
I watched the first half hour of this and couldn't get through it. I dislike Michael Moore as much as anybody, but the fellow that put this piece together needs to go back to film school. It's an amateurish, whining documentary made more for spite (and those 15 minutes we all want) than anything else. Getting called down by Michael Moore at a public event and then talking to some sympathetic people outside (people who probably just had nothing better to do on campus that night) doesn't prove that Michael Moore followers are all waffling malcontents, dude. Overall, I rate this film FAIL
I have an HP Pavillion ZE5000 series laptop. My laptop hardly fits in this bag. The battery holder is also too small. Practically unusable. Very disappointed with the product
I absolutely love these earrings. Very well made, beautiful design and a lot of silver
My daughter got this came for Christmas and it is still fun to play, but the new graphics are very confusing and hard to follow.  They want a little overboard in their updating of this one.  New colors would have been fine, but all the curves, zig-zags, etc, make this version a poor substitute for the older versions.  I'm going to ebay!
Never guess these are wheat free!  Whole family loves them.  Will continue to purchase
This purchase was done by my husband.(Need I say more, ladies?) This soup(if you can even call it that) was a waste of money. There was hardly any seafood in it at all, and what little there was, it was in small pieces. It was more like 'cream in a can'. My son and husband are both big soup eaters, and love chowder. Let's just say that he bought a case of the stuff and 10 cans are still sitting in the pantry awaiting the next garbage day! I will admit that I didn't try it...it didn't smell or look appealing. But if my husband (the human garbage can) says it's awful stuff, I take his word for it....and so should you!
I think this is the best version to come out yet. I would have a high end pc if I was to upgrade only software. I would just wait and buy a new pc. Its alot easyer then learning a new operating system and if you enable the adminstrator account and only use your standard accounts to surf the web then it give you some security. The firewall is good in the business versions and there is some good virus software out there. Its got alot more features and run's good's. Device drivers are easyier to load -scott 
Great product, the girls had a blast with it.  Real easy to use and real easy to put the gems back in the jeweler once you take them out of your hair.  Great fun for girls who enjoy dressing up and getting bedazzled!  Although it kinds of pulls a piece of hair or two out when you try and slide them out of your hair.  Not all the time though.  Still a fabulous product.  Would highly recommend it.  My niece wishes it came with more gems
I've listened to this piece of work several times, in many positions, on various stero systems, during different moods and I just can't understand the lyrics half the time and the arrangements were best described as 'a wall of mud'. ---  --- It isn't a question of country music, or contemporary music, with ELH she has demonstrated throughout the years she just loves, and respects, GOOD MUSIC.  The music is good, the woman has impeccable taste but this time I had wished she sat in on the mixing process. ---  --- I think I understand the aim of this collection but geez, I wish I didn't.  I am too accustomed to hearing ELH's clear voice slice to the heart of the lyrics, take them and present them with a totally unique perspective.  I won't start on her own playing because this review would be nothing but gushing about her near-total mastery of her craft.   ---  --- She's an amazing woman, artist and collaborator -- I love her because she is everywhere in music: supporting new artists, doing background for others, her duets are gems of generosity with respect for her fellow artists, while always doing what's best for the song.  I just hope there's no follow up to WB.   ---  --- I'm very happy with my other 8 ELH cds and I'm in awe of 'All Roads Running' and my [...]is going to be front center next week in Los Angeles.  It's like waiting for Xmas
This cable really cleaned up the display image. I had been running another Monster Cable - the 6 meter version. I needed the length before because of the way my system was configured. I have a review under that cable about how quality does matter. ---  --- And so does length. At the time I wrote the review I was just ordering the cable and was posting what I had found out in researching digital video signals. Everything in there stands true. ---  --- I changed my setup and decided to invest in a shorter version of the cable - the 1 meter version - because I could now get away with a much shorter cable. I installed it this morning and the difference, while not earth shattering, was definitely visible. ---  --- I use this cable to connect between the video card on a media PC and my TV (Sony rear-projection LCD). The image used to swim a little along the edges of some windows, text, etc., and the image wasn't as clear as I had hoped. While the image looked good, it didn't look great. That's why I decided to take the plunge and spend an extra $79 bucks. ---  --- The difference is somethine like going from a regular RF feed to your TV and component video cables. Now the image is crisp and clear and there is no swimming. It actually brings out detail I couldn't even see before - to the point of deciding to turn on FSAA and filtering so video games have a more realistic look. And that they do. ---  --- I don't know how other brands compare to the Monster Cables as I haven't tried them. What I do know is that signal integrity is very important to a good looking display. You can get that with high quality cables and by keeping the length to the absolute minimum required as there was a very perceptible difference just between the 1 meter and 6 meter versions of the exact same thing. ---  --- One more thing while I'm here. I want to thank Amazon for going the extra mile on customer service. I had a DVD disappear somehow during shipping. UPS said they delivered it but I never received it. I asked Amazon if they filed the report with UPS or I did to file a claim. What I got was a reply telling me a replacement was already on its way. That is service. Thanks Amazon
This Skagen watch is full of class, yet it's perfect for casual wear too. Very thin, so it's not clunky like a lot of other watches. Titanium black... and the band is black metal as well. Had to bend the clasp a bit to get it to hold, but now it's perfect. And because it's not an expansion braclet, it's very easy to adjust the band to fit your wrist. I hope to have this for years to come, because I've not seen anything like it. And the price is right too
Etta never fails to deliver in the vocals. Gutteral bombast, sweet soul, gospel, blues, the lady is a living legend. But this album, like the last album "produced" by her son, is a nightmare. Chessy arrangments, tinkly bass, poor sound all around. She is a fierce mother and I'm sure she thinks her kids know best, but there is a reason why labels pair vocalists with the right producer. Should Etta get the chance to work with a fresh ear at the deck, she wouldn't need the novelty of some of the song choices.  --- PS - 200lbs lighter and she remains the best live performer; blues, R/B, soul, whatever,  in the world.
Holds the phone in an attractive, snug, leather case!  Clips to belt and holds tight.  Since the phone is horizontal and not vertical, I don't have trouble catching it on things.  I've broken the clip on several cases getting in and out of the car.  The phone would catch on something and the plastic clip would snap.  This case works great and eliminates that problem!  The perfect solution
Elaine Pagels is a wonderful writer.  Her explanation into early Christianity is wonderful.  It is definitely worth the time to read this.  She delves into the politics of the early church, the Passion, the resurrection, as well as the clashes between Gnostic and Orthodox thinking.  Too often, we forget that what we call the canon is not the only writings available.  She just reminds us that there is this whole other world of writings that did not make it into the bible for one reason or another.  If you want to get an idea of who the Gnostics were, read this
 ---  ---    We did have one of these items before and ours was just at the end of it's life, so the only place we ould find another one was through Weber. We love it
+ Creme Filling ---  --- + I suppose they taste alright if you can prevent them from falling apart all over the floor. ---  --- - You cannot prevent them from falling apart all over the floor. ---  --- - They are unbelievably dry
It clearly states for the shell material 100% nylon. The price and the nylon shell was the main reason I bought the jacket. The jacket is completely polyester. The tag says Shell: 100% polyester and Lining: 100% polyester. Returning it would be pointless. I'm very disappointed in the accuracy of the information
    ---  --- 1 of 8 people found the following review helpful: --- I loved this movie!, June 4, 2006 --- Aladdin is total family entertainment. The music is awesome and clever- great voices wonderful to watch. --- Other classics not to forget about are: --- Mary Poppins --- My Fair Lady --- The Wizard of Oz --- Chitty Chitty Bang Band --- The first Charlie and the Chocolate Factory --- The Sound of Music --- Oliver --- West Side Story --- Fiddler on the Roof --- Singing in the Rain --- The Wiz --- Little Mermaid --- Aladdin --- Beauty and the Beast --- Grease --- The King and I --- Oklahoma --- The Music Man --- South Pacific ---  --- My Voice Students are always asking me for recommendations so I though I'd post it for all! We can't forget about these great musicals
Great taste and value!  It taste best with a high quality honey!  A must for tea drinkers
Interview is definitely a different type of magazine for me- someone who usually reads business and travel mags- and it's not quite what I expected. With a title like "Interview" I read my first copy of this magazine anticipating pages and pages of nothing but interviews. It turns out that interviewing is the main focus of the magazine, but it's not the only one. There is substantial space given to fashion, movies, and other areas, too. Some of these columns are worth an occasional look, but they failed to grab my attention. The writers seem to play it safe, and that includes the interview section. They don't ask many daring or controversial questions. They keep it simple, asking questions about an entertainer's latest album or movie, without delving much into their personal lives.  ---  --- Interview has many general annoyances. My greatest complaint is the advertising and the arrangement of the contents. About half of the pages in each issue are covered with ads, with fashion, liquor, beer, and hair care items providing the bulk of the advertising revenue. The ads are everywhere, with the majority in the front pages of each issue. The table of contents is buried, and I find this very frustrating. The contents starts with the interviews for that specific issue on one page, then a few pages later, proceeds to the remainder of the contents, which is the regular monthly features. What's annoying is that you have to search for the table of contents. It varies from one issue to the next, falling somewhere in the first half.  ---  --- Interview also varies greatly in length. Some issues are as short as 80 pages while others are more than 200 pages long. The shorter issues use staples for binding while the longer issues are bound in a more professional way, minus any metal.  ---  --- This magazine centers on entertainers, fashion, music, and the like. You won't find any interviews with politicians, businessmen, etc. Interview sticks strictly to entertainers, and that includes the regular monthly columns. You won't find a column about the business side of the music industry or film industry. You will find only articles about the stars themselves.  ---  --- Interview's only saving grace is the photography. It would make a nice gift for those who enjoy fashion and who like looking at pages and pages of men and women modeling fancy clothing. But in many ways, the photos are overemphasized and there isn't enough substance to the magazine. The articles are very shallow with more eye candy than reading material.  ---  --- Overall, Interview is sloppy and cluttered with too many ads to make it worthwhile reading material. My subscription was free, and I'm thankful that it was. Besides a few nice photos for clothing, there isn't much to make this magazine worth the cost. 
This is another fly by night workout machine that looks great in the pictures and on videos but when you take it out of the box, you realize that it is poorly and cheaply constructed. I own a ton of excerise equipment and this is the only piece of equipment I have had to return...I have purchased so much on the internet this past year and have been very happy with all of my products. That is until I purchased this Ab-Doer which was a TOTAL waste of time and money.  ---  --- The tension on the arms of the unit is way too flimsy and loose...The foam around the arms is also very cheap foam in fact my daughter used it "once" and there was already a small chunk of foam that came off the unit...She does not even have long nails...The bars that connect the seat to the bottom of the unit stay in place ok when your on it, but they do not lock in the base when your not on it so if you pick-up the unit to move it, it collapses...  ---  --- What's really bad is the so called back massager that is located on the main area of the center stem. It does nothing but hurt your back and is worthless...Even adjusting the bar for different heights is a joke...It's a screw, not a quick disconnect...  ---  --- This is one of those products that make a ton of money by mass advertising but will quickly fad out fast unless there are MAJOR changes done to this unit...It's sad when you watch some of those excercise info-mercials that have all these people with great bodies that may be fooling you into believing that the products really work... ---  --- I couldn't find any reviews on these until now...I will never again buy a product without reading reviews from the customer themselves. We are the best source of honesty on the market...Save your money or just do some sit-ups and leg raises if you can...They work SOOOOO MUCH BETTER than this product !!!  ---  --- If you do some searching, you will see some of the BAD reviews about this product that are coming in...Based on Amazon's review rules, I cannot list where I read them from... ---  --- Have a Great day everyone !!!  --- 
This is nothing compared to their EP, which was great by the way. Songs lack of inventive, arrangements and feeling... maybe a couple of songs are to be rescued, but no more
This is my first digital picture frame, so I do not have anything to compare it against.  I am generally very happy with this product - it is very easy to use, and I am happy with the resolution and the picture quality.  ---  --- The only downside to this frame is that the instruction manual is not helpful at all, and as one other reviewer noted, I had to learn how to do things by trial and error.  I also do not like that when you make changes to the layout - rotating or deleting images, it is not "saved" to the memory card and so you need to make the changes each time.   ---  --- However, I like this product enough to buy more of these for the grandparents this next Christmas
You can put up to 6 shelves inside to fully use all the cubic space available. But you may just need 4 and leave the lower two open for big size items to be stored. Rubbermaid has a similar size shed but it can only accept three shelves and waste a lot of spaces. The Rubbermaid shed uses much fewer pieces to assembly than this one. The assmbly is pretty easy if you follow the manu but it does take some time (1-2 hours). After I finished the assembly there were some rain and the inside was try except a couple of water drops. The only concern is its sturdiness since it's assembled with 28 pieces and so far so good. I don't expect it can stand a ternado or hurricane. One thing I wan to alert you: when you buy the shelves do measure the inside and ignore the manu since if you buy the side according it yuo will find the shelves will shift too much to the left or right. You want them more stable, right? ---  --- Recommended.
Twinings was founded in London, England in 1706, and has a long and respected tradition of producing only the finest of teas. English Breakfast tea is a mixture of black teas from Sri Lanka, which are blended to produce a smooth yet flavorful tea. Though often served during breakfast, this tea tastes excellent all day long. ---  --- OK, let's get down to brass tacks - this is another great tea. Harder to over-steep than some of the teas I have known, it consistently produces a smooth and highly drinkable cup. Highly conventional in its taste, English Breakfast tea has a robust flavor that stands up well to lemon and milk, which makes it a favorite among those who like to accessorize their tea. Plus, I must say that this tea is wonderful iced - add some lemon and sugar, and you've got the right tea for a hot afternoon! ---  --- And that's my review. If you want an excellent all-round tea, hot or iced, one that goes well with any food, then English Breakfast tea is for you. If you want tea from a great tea producer, them Twinings is for you. I highly recommend Twinings' English Breakfast tea to all, even those not normally into tea drinking. (Or, perhaps especially to those not normally into tea drinking!
I purchased a iPod video and the case has scratched up the screen around the outside.  On the inside of the case they've got some ruff edges that will damage you iPod screen.   ---  --- If you'd like scratches on your iPod screen then purchase this case, but if you'd like to keep your screen from being scratched then STAY AWAY FROM THIS CASE!
I loved it the first 2 months i had it.  With out notice the cable shredded.  I called and emailed and nobody at the company got back with me.  It seem that the inside of the wheel was rough and began tearing it. ---  --- The customer service is bad and so was the product
Many games my kids have aren't actually geared towards kids.  This game is perfect for children.  It's fun without being too hard or easy.  My children are 6 and 8 years old and can be challenged and entertained.  I highly recommend this as a great family game.  Many games we can take turns playing
Horrible. Must go through hell to return it too, they won't give you back the shipping to send it to you, just the cost of the item. Do not buy. Do not recommend
I'm a big fan of the high-end Flukes so I've worked with the best. Well, these defintitely aren't the best, but you can't beat what you get for the price. I got it for my brother for his car and it does the job well. ---  --- First, the bad: --- 1. No auto shut-off. You gotta make sure you turn it off or the battery will just keep draining away. --- 2. No auto-sensing. You gotta set the dial for the range you're looking for. But hey, I like it so much I don't care that I can't be so lazy. ---  --- And the good: --- 1. All the features. You get all the standards PLUS a tach and a dwell-meter! That'll about cover your carbureted cars. --- 2. Price. You can find multimeters that can't do the extras for the same price and even more. Great bargain. --- 3. Alligator clips. Simple things but it'd be a pain without them. ---  --- Plus, this thing will handle all the home electrical work. ---  --- As for the rest: I won't vouch for its durability but Actron is a decent company. They go towards affordable but not junky. The case is made of a light plastic, but it doesn't seem fragile. As for the tolerances, they're not bad: --- DC Volts  --- Range:  200mV, 2V, 20V, 200V  --- Accuracy : ±(0.5% rdg + 5 dgts)  --- Range:  1000V  --- Accuracy: ±(0.8% rdg + 5 dgts) ---   --- AC Volts  --- Range:  2V, 20V, 200V  --- Accuracy : ±(0.8% rdg + 5 dgts)  --- Range:  750V  --- Accuracy: ±(1.0% rdg + 4 dgts) ---   --- DC Current  --- Range: 200mA  --- Accuracy: ±(0.8% rdg + 5 dgts)  --- Range: 10A  --- Accuracy: ±(1.2% rdg + 5 dgts)  ---  --- Resistance  --- Range: 200, 2K, 20K, 200K, 2M  --- Accuracy: ±(0.8% rdg + 5 dgts)  --- Range: 20M  --- Accuracy: ±(1.5% rdg + 5 dgts)  ---  --- Dwell  --- Range:  4CYL, 6CYL, 8CYL  --- Accuracy: ±(3.0% rdg + 5 dgts)  ---  --- RPM  --- Range:  4CYL, 6CYL, 8CYL  --- Accuracy: ±(3.0% rdg + 5 dgts)  ---  --- Audible Continuity  --- Buzzer sounds at approximately less  --- than 30-50 Ohms. ---  --- So for the price, a good deal
This watch is gorgeus, it's a very big watch (it doesn't look so big on the picture), the screen can be set to black or red, looks good either way. Very confortable
This is the way to beat the airline travel restrictions for carrying liquids.  Actually I liked everything about this product.  Certainly easy to use and certainly pleased with the performance.  No more mini bottles of shampoo for me
My five year old wanted drums for christmas so my dad got her this. she loves it and so do we. it has volume control and you can use head phones with it. It has good sound and so far isnt driving me nuts. she hasn't had any of the problems other people described with thiers
After going through nearly 6 mouses (including several of the Microsoft mouses), I settled on this because its round contuour shape and large effective button area that extend very far back. It also works with my KVM switch, which is a key consideration. The buttons are a bit stiff but I expect them to "loosen" up a bit after some use. I highly recommend this mouse
This item is invaluable in preventing Plagiocephaly (flattening of the head)...I wish we had known about it for our twins.  Newborns especially need a very soft surface for their very soft and malleable skulls.  We used it for our third baby and as a result, he has a perfectly round head and proportioned features.  The incline greatly reduced spit up as the 'flap' between their esophagus and stomach is not developed yet.  Gravity prevents the milk/formula from traveling back up and causing gas and or spit up.  I've noticed the biggest complaint about this item is that infants seem to slip down in it during the night.  This is true, however, rolling up a receiving blanket real tight and placing it in a "U" shape under our son's bottom prevented this from happening ever again.  As a result, he slept soundly, never spit up once, never woke us up with gas pain and has a perfectly round head.  I strongly recommend the Boppy Noggin Nest as well to keep the pressure off the head when your baby is not in his crib.  Also, if your baby is old enough to roll over, this item is not for you.  One other note: the foam wedges on either side do trap some body heat, so don't over-swaddle or put too many layers on...adjust the thickness of your blanket to the ambient temperature.  I would say this is a good item for newborns to about 5 months. It made an enourmous difference in the well being of our third child compared to his older twin siblings
When I first came home with this game and tried it, I thought it was going to be kind of dumb. But it is lots of fun and kind of addicting. I even got my 11yr old son doing some of the cooking. Plus it is a good price.
Nice cover pictures and headlines, but way too many ads.  There's a reason its only twelve bucks, this is an ad-sponsored mag
These earings were ok quality,but were really small.  They would be better suited for a child
This mag needs a new editor. I haven't seen anything interesting in Better Homes for six months. Maybe they are spread too thin with their website and contests
and mild. just a hint of fruitiness. the white tea isn't as bold as green but equally as or better for you
And it's called "Narcisso Rodriguez".   Buy the NR, you'll like it a whole lot more
if you dont have a obiwan pilot just buy a rebel pilot an put it in the ship I did it a I licke it and if you have obiwan imagine it change cloth. ---  --- I thinck this starfighter is best only for the colors because for me al jedi starfighter are the same and the firing misiles I tacke them out because then they get lost
Most of the world still runs on PCs and as a Mac owner (and lover), it can be tough to find software for basic stuff like accounting.  I'm a guy who makes a living making stuff sound good for radio, TV, video games and so on.  As a freelancer, I need something to keep track of my business banking, credit cards, expenses and invoices and this program does just that and very intuitively, just like my Mac.  --- I used MYOB--a Mac accounting program--but found it to be tricky and didn't end up with the comprehensive reports for my accountant that I expected and wound up going over everything expense by expense and invoice by invoice for hours.  It could be that I didn't understand the program well enough, but support is extra everytime you call customer service for help, so no thanks MYOB.  In fact, I put off doing most of my 2006 accounting until January 2007 because I dreaded trying to figure out MYOB again.   --- Then I broke down and bought Quickbooks for Mac.  It did everything I needed it to--a year's worth of accounting in a weekend and I never even cracked the manual.  It allowed me to save the year as a PC file to hand to my accountant on a CD.  A few days later he handed me back a CD with a Mac file of my adjusted accounting and my corp taxes were done and sent.   --- I can't speak for anyone with really advanced accounting needs because I never got that deep into the program, but for my needs it's right on the money.   
I was trying to watch it, but can not open de DVD because it is the wrong country code????
In Europe, you find a bowl of dark flaxseeds to the side of the muesli set out on a breakfast buffet. A great source of Omega-3 oil, you can improve your health by eating these tasty, nutty seeds. They are good for the gut and good for the heart. ---  --- The golden seeds are an attractive alternative to the nut-brown seeds. They look nice in baked goods like lighter breads. They taste the same as the dark seeds. Ground, they don't show up in white bread, so you can bust some up in the blender and throw then into your standard bread recipe and add needed nutrients and fiber. ---  --- We like them sprinkled on oatmeal, muesli or yogurt
This thing is being advertised as Dance Dance Revolution.  It is NOT DDR.  It is just a cheap knock off not worth a penny.  My daughter plays a DDR at afterschool and loves it.  She received this for Christmas, tried it once and gave up within five minutes. She said, it says fifty songs but it plays just one.  Well, the 50 "songs" all sound the same.  They are not "radio" or "stereo" quality, rather just computer generated noise.  Totally awful.  Having tried it myself, I am very disappointed and don't blame my daughter for not giving it a second glance.  Total waste of money and total false advertising.  This company should be investigated.  Believe the poor reviews and skip this product!!!! 
I'm in charge of a weekly touch football game where we use an official NFL football from a previous year and I wanted to get another one for backup. I know 'The Duke' is supposed to be the official NFL ball from this year, but there seems to be something wrong with the balls Amazon is shipping.  ---  --- The first ball I got from Amazon was hard as a rock, slick as all get out and had poor stitching in the laces. I got a second one and the stitching was a bit better, but it was still hard and slippery. And when it was exposed to rain, the ball stained the hands of everyone who touched it with red coloring. I have no clue if that's to be expected or not since it's all leather but it seems odd.   ---  --- In any case, you can grip the ball with a good pair of sticky football gloves, which also help mitigate the pain of catching the ball. So, it is usable and throws a nice spiral but maybe I play ball with a bunch of wussies cuz no one else wants to get near that thing out of fear of breaking their hands (which is kind of annoying given how much i paid for the balls).  ---  --- Maybe the footballs just need to be broken in, but I'm not really sure how to do that aside from playing with them, which no one seems to want to do. I've tried to let some air out to make the things more user-friendly, but it doesn't really help.  ---  --- Anyway, I find it really hard to believe this is the ball the NFL played with this year. Something about them just seems cheaply made. In any case, I suggest you save some money and go with a decent composite leather ball. 
I bought this software two days ago, Installed it on my laptop and all of a sudden, my network connection was messed up. I could not figure how to connect to the wireless or wired network. My other computers were still able to connect, so it was a problem with the computer with Fix It installed. After much work, I finally uninstalled the software and right away was able to get back on the network. I am not sure if there is some kind of firewall setting with the software, or if it was just the software itself. ---  --- Anyway, I am unsure whether to reinstall this software or not
This is a great tea, and very economical when buying bulk from Amazon.  I'm very happy with it
A truly glorious recording, just what I want in music, with brilliancy, sensitivity, and beauty. This is a must have for every music lover worth the name
The Korg reads a tuning fork as slightly flat, however, it's still a vast improvement from a tin ear
Increases nutritional value of soups and smoothies and tastes almost like nuts
These apples are coated in sugar and other gunk (like sunflower oil) which gives them a strange taste. I was very disappointed when I tried them. I was wanting nice dried apples that taste like apples instead of oil, sugar and preservatives. Now I'm stuck with two bags of a product that is not very good. I also got stuck with the dried strawberries which are even worse. I will not be trying any more Stoneridge Orchard products. BE AWARE!!, these products cannot be returned to Amazon so be sure before you order
I called Garmin tech support yesterday (10/17), did wait about 15 minutes to speak to someone.  I called in the morning so it wasn't a long wait.  Since my nuvi is still under warranty (1 year warranty) I requested a RMA for a replacement suction cup mount.  The tech asked how it had failed -- mine also had melted to the windshield so I had to rip it off -- and responded like he was very familiar with the problem.  He also mentioned the rubber material of the original design was defective and that they had a new rubber material design and would send me a new one.  I didn't have to pay for it and should get here in 7-10 days
I totally love this DVD! They really show how to do grooves, not just some moves that you can only do to a specific music video. These are grooves you can make  your own and go and dance any where with. That what I think makes this DVD series totally different from the rest. The moves are current and fun and the host and dancers are excellent dancers and also fun to watch. It goes slow enough and they turn around backwards to show you how to do it. LOVE IT!!! LOVE IT!!! LOVE IT!!! I am hooked on the Groovaloos
I ordered enough Stevia packets to last me for 1 year. Most of the packets have the sugar hardened.  Every so often I am finding one that is powder as it should be. The others must have gotten some kind of moisture to them because they are hard.  I will never buy Stevia from the company I purchased from again.  I don't have the receipt or I would have returned them asking for a refund. I have been upset about the way they came.
I found these diapers while searching for the 7th generation brand diapers. I was impressed and eager to try Tushies because there was no chlorine and no gell used to produce them, I ordered the medium size for my 20lb baby. The diapers came sooner then expected, which was great. My single star rating comes from my experience using them. They have no elastic and they are stiff which makes it hard to get a super snug fit. It seems like no matter how tight I can get the diapers my son leaks through them, out the sides and up the belly. Because the moisture does not wick away from his skin he also developed a diaper rash- his first and we have been only using these diapers for a week
They didn't lie in the description! This stuff does have a delightful flavor that is both sweet and tart. Thing is, I had no idea it would be so STRONG! These little sticks of gum pack some serious flavor, and it lasts a long time. A worthwhile buy, I say
Everybody I know loves this film. In today's environment, when WKW is being hailed as the premier director from Asia, and one of the world's best, I don't know how many really actually love the film, and how many don't have the courage to state a contrary opinion. Make no mistake, I think WKW is one of the greatest directors I have ever watched - how can somebody who makes a movie like "In The Mood For Love" (ITMFL) not be? Actually, his greatness lies not just in his ability to make a movie like ITMFL, but in his versatility. It is almost impossible to conceive that the same person made both ITMFL and Chungking. Well, his greatness notwithstanding, I can't stand this film. And no, I can't sit, lie, or do anything else with it either. ---  --- So what is it about this movie which gets my goat? The directorial style, and the cinematography. Actually, I think parts of the latter are great, and the parts I don't like are influenced by the former, so let me just talk about the former. WKW uses a particular style which extends across most of his other films, including "Happy Together" and "Fallen Angels" (yes, I've seen all of them, and hate almost all of them uniformly). The hallmark of this style is a very modern, staccato, piecemeal approach, stringing together relatively disparate ideas, scenes, or action sequences (almost reminiscent of Godard's "Breathless", as the editorial review says here, though not quite). His style is further marked by characteristic filming styles - for example, the slow shutter speed effect. Actually, this is one of his peeves, which even spills over to ITMFL, where it oh-so-doesn't-fit-and-stands-out-like-a-sore-thumb. Having watched nearly all his films, and having seen the wide array of situations across which is deploys this mechanism, and having spent hours analyzing the potential connecting theme, I can assure you that there is absolutely no uniformity and sense to its usage. It gets used for dream-like sequences, for grounded reality; for sentimental togetherness, for aloofness; for tears, for laughter; for thoughts, for action; the list goes on. WKW similarly uses other weapons in his vast director's repertoire to some bizarre effects, taking improvisation to an extreme where it stops being laudatory. ---  --- The above notwithstanding, let me round off by saying that if the kind of style I have delineated above appeals to you, then you should definitely watch this film, for outside of his jarring style, WKW has pieced together a great story and actors. As for myself, I will continue to watch every one of his films, living in the suspense of what this genius will do next - make me fall in love, or hate. --- 
Born in Steventon, Hampshire in 1775, Jane Austen was one of two daughters of the Reverent George Austen and his wife Cassandra. She was educated in Oxford and in Southampton, finally attending a boarding school in the Abbey gatehouse in Reading, Berkshire. The environment provided by her home was conducive to writing and she often enacted plays for her family, something that gave her the opportunity to present her stories and develop the characters in depth.  ---  --- Jane Austen's works are imaginative, full of emotion and depicting relationships that transcend time. Jane Austen wrote about society, about propriety and about etiquette. She was highly critical of the snobbery with which the upper classes kept away from others. Her study of human flaws and prsonal relationships provide great material for the development of her characters. ---  --- Jane Austen wrote Pride and Prejudice in 1813 and it still enchants audiences all over the world. The first time I read this book, I read as a child, back in Cuba, "Orgullo y Prejuicio."  ---  --- The writings of Jane Austen shaped my perception of true love as I identified with the love between Elizabeth Bennet and her one and only, Mr. Darcy. With this BBC adaptation completed in 1996, I have been able to relive the experience of exposing myself to a classic, one of the best books ever written. With this BBC miniseries we feel as though we were reading the book, for the adaptation faithfully follows the author's writing.  ---  --- The filming is magnificent, offering us a view of gorgeous scenery, magnificent castles, and locations that bring the book to life, for we can see what we expected after reading the book. The love story presents the struggle of the times, as two individuals fall in love, regardless of class differences, or status, and yet, the antagonism and friction created as a result of said differences. Darcy is a wealthy single man who, upon meeting the family of Elizabeth, boisterous, non-polished, and simple, believes her to be beneath him. The meet at a dance where his best friend falls in love with Elizabeth sister, but Darcy thinks he knows Jane's heart not to be true to these emotions. Elizabeth overhears a conversation during the dance and feels insulted by the proud and distant Darcy, keeping her distance and yet, without her awareness, falling in love with him. Jane Austen is masterful at creating enough tension to keep us all in suspense as to the path these lives will take as some members of Elizabeth family make the wrong choices.  ---  --- The dialogue is almost verbatim to the book, making this series a true delight for those of us who identify with this work. Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth and Colin Firth as Darcy provide magnificent interpretations of this timeless classic, keeping us all dreaming of ever encountering love of this magnitude in our lives. As with most DVDs that we own, we watch by selecting English subtitles, which enhances the viewing by allowing us NOT to miss a single word said by the characters. Who would want to miss a single word in this marvel of the English language? There is a documentary as an additional bonus, where interviews with cast members are included... simply awesome! Interviewed are:  Jennifer Ehle [Elizabeth], Colin Firth [Darcy]. We also get to see those who played Mary Bennet [Lucy Briers], Mr. Collins [David Bamber, Mr. Bingley [Crispin Bonham-Carter] and Mr. Wickham [Adrian Lukis]
Fits well. Eventhough I just bought it, I think it's going to sustain the extreme Virginia weather for couple of years
Purchased this item for traveling. Our son doesn't travel well. So we purchased this item for him and it doesn't strap on to the car seat like the picture shows. The straps are material and velcro on the ends. How do you attach these straps? So, now we just let him play with it being free. It doesn't attach
I bought this as a backup drive several months ago for my home business after the iomega backup drive I was using crashed and took my backup with it.   ---  --- The Maxtor software installs automatically when you plug in the drive so that part was really easy and it took just a few minutes.  The initial backup was really easy and went pretty fast too.  So far, so good.  The problem is that once the initial backup takes place the backup function doesn't backup new or updated files!  ---  --- The scheduled backup doesn't work at all.  The light flashes so you think it's working but it doesn't backup ANY new or updated files.   ---  --- The synch is useless too.  It's like the backup function.  It will synch your files one time but then after that it doesn't synch any of your new or updated files like it's supposed to.  It's like it takes a snapshot of your computer at a specific time and that's it.  ---  --- To get around the fact that it won't automatically back up my files I have to manually transfer my files every few days or so which is a real pain as I have to remember what files have been updated and/or are new. ---  --- I would NOT buy this product again.  It's not an automatic backup drive, it's just an external drive that will back up one time but then isn't reliable AT ALL.    ---  --- If you need a backup drive look elsewhere. Sorry to say, this one is a complete waste of money.
(With the possible exception of Klemperer's Fidelio.) ---  --- I am deeply comforted to see from other reviews that others are finally getting the message. As Mr Clinton's campaign team would say, "It's the singing, stupid". Do *not* be mislead by the starry names, this thing barks and yowls like New Year's Eve in the cats-and-dogs home. ---  --- Do not pass Go, do not waste $35, go directly to Josef Krips on Decca Legends for three discs of perfect joy
I was trying my hardest to be creept out, but like someone said, it read like a pre-teen novel.

My son has had this pogo stick for about a year and has not been able to play on it because the spring is too stiff and does not compress easily.  Even my daughter who weighs 70 lbs cannot get it to work.  Our 11 year old neighbour who has her own pogo stick had no problems, but it is not for the beginner
I really like Splenda, but this Hazelnut flavor has a distinctly over-chemicaled taste and just doesn't have much nuttiness to it.  Perhaps the other flavors are better
I wanted an automatic watch for a while, and I was attracted to the green trim on this model. The watch is big and heavy. This is probably true of most automatics. My issue is that it seems to be too thick. I think the glass/crystal back adds a millimeter or so.  --- The band has a slight problem that I can probably fix. Right where the metal of the band contacts the case, one side of the band has bent slightly causing the band to interfere with the rotating bezel. I may have caused this when adjusting the linkage, or it may have come delivered that way. I think I could simply detach the band and squeeze it back into its proper shape. I have actually left it alone as I do not want the bezel to rotate, and the defect is not visible. --- As far as accuracy, it seems to have gained about 20-30sec in a week.  --- Had I seen the watch in a store and tried it on, I would probably not have bought it. I was not happy when it arrived, but I have worn it for a week, and I am now glad that I picked it. --- The only other issue is that I wish the luminous markings were brighter. I purposely picked the black face to be easier to see the markings in the dark (as opposed to the white face), but I have had better luck with other watches
I purchased this to replace a lost holster.  The first time I tried to place the 7290 in the case, it split at the seams
So many books on the market about pregnancy focus on the medical aspect of what is growing in your wife's little belly, and not how that little thing is changing your wife and life forever! This book describes to a 'T' how this life changing event reeks havoc on everyone involved in the process, and it does it in a way that is bust-a-gut funny. Before I read this book, I was like "what the heck is wrong with my wife?"  After reading this book, I was more like "Ohhh, I know why she just ripped my head off... she hates the smell of carrots!"  Great book, fast and fun read, a must read for a new dad. I've bought it for every father to be, and they in turn have done the same.
I agree on "it was too good to be true" statement for this package. --- The material used for earbud and the charger is really cheap !. The  --- charger melted in the car after a sunny day, I couldn't even test it. Earphone quality is not good as well, giving a constant humming noise. The case is the best out of these three so far. So one out of three for 10 bucks. I am not recommending anyone to buy this item. 
    Haribo's has the best gummi candy.  I love the pink grapefruit, but it is very hard to find unless you have acess to a candy store.  Haribo has the best candy... Amazon has the best price
I bought this to simplify our morning routines and save them from pouring large bowls and throwing it away. The kids loved the choices. The only downside was the portions were extremely small, even for my 4 year old. On average they ate two a day
It started 31 years ago...when my in laws, from Washington came for a visit (to California), bearing gifts.  A wonderful treat called Market Spice Tea.  We added a tablespoon of it to our pot of brewing coffee and haven't stopped yet, 31 years later. --- I'm just thrilled we can do it online, now. --- Yeah, Market Spice! and Yeah, Amazon...for bringing it to us! --- (We're in Missouri now, and are spreading it across the nation, as we go) --- Your #1 fan! --- Melody Arnold --- Wentworth, M
This software might be recommended if better utilities weren't out there. This one gives the user a sense of security, but when my system crashed, Fix-It couldn't. I dutifully put in the Rescue Disk, booted up on it, restored my earlier system, exited and rebooted. ---  --- Nothing. Before I'd been able to get into safe mode, but now nothing. So when I manually restored my system, guess which program got yanked? And it freed up a lot of system resources, too. (Had I known how much before, that alone would have soured me.) My system now runs faster and doesn't lag while typing. ---  --- Another small criticism: Even though Fix-It has automatic update for virus scans, I found more often than not I had to go to the VCom site and manually download the anti-virus files. No reason was ever given; I'd just get a message telling me to do it. Very inconvenient. ---  --- Also WARNING*WARNING: This program has strict activation. You can only have it on one computer, so forget putting it on your notebook computer.  ---  --- Finally, be careful when cleaning your registry. Look at every entry this suite wants to delete. If you run it on default, it may remove critical registry keys and settings. In fact, I'd use a different registry cleaner or some of the free ones.  ---  --- Fix-It has some great features, but not enough to make it worth the system resources and a system sluggish system. (Not to mention the anti-virus problem). Try System Mechanic instead.  --- 
I love this show so much!! IT just has so much passion and beauty and all the cast members sing so well!! Sutton Foster as Jo, was cast very well, its obvious she deserved that Tony nomination in 2005, and the sisters, even though they weren't the leads, they all had such great songs, especially Beth, whose song, "Some things are meant to be" always brings tears to my eyes,its just so touching. I would definitely recomend this CD to anyone who loves musical theatr
Well its definetly improved version since the last one, but they still have a lot of things to do.  The biggest problem is Pages.  If text has specific symbols, like Greek letters and u try to export your file to doc, forget it.  u'll have the same problem as 10 yrs ago, either funky symbols or underline dashes.  Keynote is much better.  But if u r a scientist and not a sales man, both packages still have a lot of room for improvement.  However, I'm still happy with this purchase, because it's Apple soft and looks much nicer than any MS software will get in the future
These breast pads are sooooo different from the Johnson & Johnson product.  They don't absorb your milk, which means it still gets all over your clothes.  The don't have adhesive, which means the pads move all over the place.  Generally, just a waste of money.  You might as well use toilet tissue :).
This game set it of amazing quality. Every piece has so much detail it just looks good without doing anything! The Dubloons are the best part, and like others have said, make the BEST clinking sound when you drop a pile into your hand. ---  --- This game is definately worth buying.... IF you come up with some new rules that make the game more interesting. The gameplay is very uninteresting, boring, and brainless. My wife never passes up an opportunity to tell me how boring it was, and even her younger (12 year old) sister thought it was boring and had more fun playing with the pieces. My wife says I should have bought us Settlers of Catan instead of spending my money on this (before we got our own set... now we have one), but when I bought it I knew it would be just for the game pieces. I am brewing up some good rules to change the gameplay dramatically and make it much more interesting. She likes Settlers so much.. maybe I will get some trade of spices into the game and whatnot. ---  --- Anyways, if you are creative and have a good idea for a ship game, then DEFINATELY get this game set. It is high quality and beautiful. But, if you don't have the interest to make your own game, then pass this one up because you would most likely love to play any other game you own before this
In general I'm a big fan of movie music, but to tell the truth I expected more from this one. This soundtrack is incomaparable to say Lord of the Rings or Star Wars movie music. It lacks depth and emotion and power. Unlike emotionally potent melodies present in LOTR soundtrack the Eragon is pretty dull and uninteresting. I get the impression that the entire album is in fact a variation of a single theme called Eragon. I get the feeling that entire album has only one very long and boring track. I hope they'll make better album for the next movie of the Inheritence Trilogy.
today is 3-19-07.  this item is labeled as being purchased on 3-21-07.  will I purchase another order on that date
This stool is great, right size for young child to seat on the potty. It is narrow and doesn't take up a lot of room, plus it saves my back from having to pickup grand daughter to set her on the potty
I owned Samsung T809 months ago and I was very frustrated because the bluetooth doesn't work well, sometimes it has connection (bluetooth) but most of the time it doesn't work.  --- Yeah! it's a good looking cellphone but not a friendly user one.
i bought this item as so many people has said how much they loved it.  i find it a nightmare!  if you stand in the corridor between the monitor and the receiver it cuts out.  it does not work when on the charger.  it does not work unless there is a clear line between the two parts. what a piece of junk.  I would in no way recommend this product to anyone
This album is essentially a fusion of great musical minds.  The legendary Khan payes more attention to making this a better experience for the western audiences of the Sufi music by playing more with his (brilliant) vocal skills then with the lyrics.  Micheal Brooks' music stands out and enhances the experience further.  This is not to say that the mainstream Indo-Paki audience won't enjoy this album ( This is one of my all time favs).  It is fabulous background listening while doing work which may need focus - for those who need music to do such things... :)  ---  --- For those who have been thinking of testing out Sufi music, this is the place to start.  This is a fine introduction to the great NFAK and Sufi music. 
I got this bracelet for my boyfriend. Initially, I was looking at two different designs, but I'm really interested with this one. I made up my mind to buy this bracelet. When I received it, I'm vary satisfied with it. It's really nice, and the good thing is my boyfriend really like it. It's a worth buy.
I don't know what the complaints about this product are.  It seems that people are trying to use it for extreme hold hairstyles.  This is not the purpose of this product.  I use it for my short haircut to make the ends stay spiky and styled out, and it works WONDERFULLY.  No matter how much you move your head, it stays in place, but somehow moves enough to keep you from having a stiff look.  And, when you brush your hair out at the end of the day, it feels like you never put it in.  Hair stays soft and feels clean.  The reason why this gel is thinner is that it isn't as sticky or goopey in your hair as other gels.  And it spreads out easier
Here's an extremely stylish, different film panned by almost all the professional critics which means here's another example of why they should be ignored. You are better off reading the reviews of people here at Amazon. ---  --- Being one who appreciates stylish film-making, I thoroughly enjoyed the images and the sound on this movie. I found it absolutely fascinating. Being a male, it doesn't hurt that Ashley Judd stars in it, either.  ---  --- To be fair, I can see where the story would turn off a number of people.The co- lead, Ewan McGregory's character, is odd and not very credible. k.d. lang's character is unlikable, there is some stupid numerology as part of the story and the ending is unsatisfying . ---  --- Yet, despite the above, the story is very involving and the visuals and sound (5.1 surround) are just so good that they way outweigh the negatives. ---  --- The movie flat-out entertains, which is the name of the game.
For years now I have been buying "bargain" cameras with the foolish notion that I did not need a nice one. Finally, I got sick of it and bought the Exilim EX-Z600. This camera is awesome. The screen is huge, the picture quality is great, it is easy to use and is sooo small. Overall, a great buy. ---  --- The one downside is that I can only connect it to my computer using the dock. Luckily, I have an SD card reader, so I normally just use that to download my pictures
I agree it's a waste to get sizes you don't need. Here's an idea to do a public exchange. I do not need the large and medium, and will be glad to give to anyone, just for the postage. I just need the small sizes.
I didn't watch Millenium when it was on ten years ago, so I thought I'd give it a try on DVD, as I'm a big X-files fan. I watched two shows: "The Beginning and the End" and "The Dogs". They were ridiculous AND boring. I'm done with Millenium
The scooter ride is really smooth! FAST transportation and really fun down hills. The breaking is pretty nice and I like the wheelie bar too. You guys will love it - get it! People say scooters are only for little kids, but I'm 18 and i'm loving scootering around campus to classes and etc. Everyone does it and it really holds more than 143 lbs
The cable set that comes in this item is what ought to have been included in the Airport Express.  This comes with a 2 meter RCA-ministereo, a 2 meter Optical-ministereo, and a 6ft power cable.  I found that both the RCA and Optical cables worked flawlessly with my receiver.  I wish that the power cable was a little longer and I would've liked to have received a white ethernet cable to complete this set.  The installation of any of these cable went very easily with the on caveat that you must ensure to remove the covers on the optical cable which may not be obvious to some
Sometimes I feel like I've been on a diet forever. Of course, I haven't been -- I've been on and off one or another, then back again.  ---  --- I don't believe any tea is a wonder cure for everything, but I find tea helpful in managing my appetite, my stress levels, and outlook on life. I drink this Oolong tea, really enjoy it, and suspect it helps me feel less hungry in the midafternoon.  ---  --- I've heard it's rich in anti-oxidants, and promotes the burning of fat. It may well be. I've lost bodyfat and weight -- but, again, I believe the result are due to a combination of factors that includes regular exercise, counting calories, and taking time to for a deep breath and a warm cuppa
I had ordered this for Hanukkah 2006, but luckily I took a sneak peak first. My daughter, aged 4, would find this far too scary. Despite its inappropriateness for the younger, more sensitive reader, it is excellently written and very well illustrated. I have not returned it, but it'll be a while before it comes down from my shelf
I have not spent tons of time working with the program yet, but have done enough to know that the learning curve is reasonable if you are somewhat publishing program literate. It has lots of potential for aiding in visualizing what your project will look like finished. If you are willing to invest some time to learn the program features, it performs as promised
Renowned artist and tarot scholar/writer Robert M. Place has produced a masterpiece in his new tarot 384 page companion book, The Buddha Tarot Companion: A Mandala of Cards. This book affords a rich unique perspective of the Tarot through the lens of the Buddhist paradigm. The companion deck comes in a beautifully illustrated box containing exquisitely designed cards that fit perfectly in my hand, a tiny black gossamer bag plus a bordered little white box with the instructions, "Embellish this box with protective and/or empowering symbols." Other suggestions that greet you as you begin your journey with the Buddha cards include: "Smudge with sage to cleanse and re-energize the cards after a reading." and "Store your deck with stones or crystals that absorb negative energy, promote healing, or provide protective energy." Also included in the box is a mini-book with guidelines on reading these particular cards. Both items are published by Llewellyn, who as always, have taken great care to ensure quality and aesthetics in the way the cards are packaged and presented. ---  --- Robert has done an amazing job in correlating the life of the Buddha with the Tarot journey through the cards. He describes how the Major Arcana fits perfectly with the life of Siddhartha and his journey of enlightenment. Each of the tarot trumps is a stage on the mystic's journey to enlightenment. In fact, it is Mr. Place's belief that the creators of the Tarot were directly influenced by the life of the Buddha, and incorporated archetypes into the Major Arcana based on his journey. He teaches that the ancient wisdoms were not isolated from one another. Instead, "the classical world maintained communications with India and the ancient Western philosophers were familar with Indian philosophies." As well, the Islamic world introduced the Christians to the life of the Buddha during the Middle Ages. "The European Christians were enamored with the story, and they transformed him into a Christian saint - St. Josaphat."  ---  --- I was fascinated by the titles given to the Major Arcana cards. Each of the 23 cards reflect an important aspect of the Siddhartha's personal journey to become the enlightened one, the Buddha. ---  --- Robert Place has created a deck and book that not only meets the needs of people who practice Eastern beliefs. He also acts as a mediator to help people of the Western world learn about and appreciate the noble tenets of Buddhism and its teachings for life. I highly recommend this deck - I found it very easy to follow, the graphics are amazingly detailed and artistically rendered and the companion book clearly helps you to learn to "read" using a Buddhist world view.  --- 
I wasn't sure if it would be worth spending the money on this case. How wrong I was. If you're into diving and have one of these cameras, buy it now
I have several Kathy Smith videos this is the absolute worse! I agree with some of the other reviewers that Kathy has not rhythm and in this video the steps do not match the beat of the music which makes it frustrating and makes her look very uncoordinated. Also, it seems like there a too many people in such a small space, the whole set looks very chaotic. I wonder if Kathy thought up the choreography for this one herself, it is very poor. All those crazy shuffle moves! Any other Kathy Smith workout will be better for you than this one.
The legend goes that there was a time a few decades ago when "The Gramophone" was the unquestioned authority for reviews of recordings of classical music. ---  --- Whether or not that legend is true (I'm too young to know), Gramophone's time has definitely passed. Today there is a multitude of sources of free information on classical music on the internet, from newsgroups to websites. Some of it is less well-informed than Gramophone's criticism, but some of it is more well-informed. What is undeniable is that, for the price of a few mouse-clicks, it is possible to find a far greater range of reviews of recordings on the Internet than Gramophone (with its British-based critics) can offer. ---  --- What is more, Gramophone is tied to a business-model for the classical music industry that is fast becoming obsolete. Historically, the most important classical recordings were issued by a few so-called "major" companies such as EMI, Deutsche Grammophon and CBS (later Sony). These "majors" would buy lavish advertising spreads in Gramophone and so finance the magazine. In return, Gramophone would devote lengthy reviews to the majors' new releases and would produce pages of fluffy interviews with musicians under contract to the majors. ---  --- Today the situation is different. The most interesting new release is more likely to appear as a MP3 on an obscure Russian website than on a new CD from Sony. Small companies, dedicated solely to classical music recordings, produce great results on shoestring budgets while the "major" corporations have virtually abandoned new classical recordings. ---  --- This development causes problems for Gramophone's business model. The new players in the classical music industry don't have the publicity budgets to fund a glossy magazine like Gramophone through advertising. With Gramophone's implicit bargain: "advertise with us or we won't review your recordings", the magazine seems to be becoming more and more irrelevant. ---  --- If you want to subscribe to a classical music periodical, I recommend "International Record Review" or "Fanfare". Both offer substantially more reviews per month than Gramophone. But most of all, I suggest checking out the huge range of classical music information available for free on the web and usenet
I have always been a fan of Sony because they make quality products that are "user-friendly".  That is why I was in a state of complete shock that this little blue cd walkman is made by Sony, because it is on the other end of the spectrum compared to what they usually manufacture. ---  --- First the bad...the control buttons (sound, changing tracks, pause, etc) are tiny and nearly impossible to read.  I found myself having to hold the cd player up to my face to find the right button, and I do not have any vision problems.  The little lcd screen is hard to read as well.  Next, the sound quality is poor and has a cheap "watered down" feel to it.  Then there are the stock headphones that the product comes with.  These are cheap and don't fit well. ---  --- I bought a yellow "psyc" sony walkman a couple years ago, and that one is 3 times the product that this one is.  The sound is near-perfect and the buttons are easy to see and use.  The headphones fit well and the whole package has lasted with no issues at all. ---  --- I wouldn't write sony off simply b/c of this product, but I would definitely do some research prior to purchasing a walkman from them. 
This product simply does not produce accurate results. It skips entire lines, words on the same line, and misreads even the most legible characters. It came bundled with my scanner, so at least I did not waste my money on it. Don't waste yours
I have only had the batteries for a short time, but they are working great. I have recharged all three sets "4 per set" three times each. (that's what taks to run my Canon PowerShotS2/I2 camera)all good news.I take a lot of pictures and I need 3 sets to keep me going for about 6 hours.But I know that I need another 3 sets to really keep me in the field for the day. I do alot of back packing and long walks on the beaches.These batteries are really good they have never let me down as of yet, that's why I will be getting more. All I can really say is byem
Another gadget I had to have.  For the price, this is a really neat outdoor thermometer that shows the high and low temperature of the day.  One important note is the location of installation.  I live in S.Fla and mounted it on the north facing window.  You must locate it in a spot where direct or even somewhat direct sunlight does not affect it as this will most likely give false readings.  If you have a glass door or window that leads to a screen enclosure, this would also allow for a fairly correct temperature reading, although this could also cause improper readings in the heat of the day as the metal pan roof can reflect heat to the inside of the screen enclosure. --- All in all, I love mine and reccomend it. I bought 10 of them at Christmas and gave them out as gifts
I don't know about other company, but Accessory Export will sell you the product that is totally different from the picture.  I bought a Genuine Contour Leather Case for Motorola Razr V3, but what I got was a cheap plastic covered with some form of soft plastic.  There is no leather on the case at all. Not only that, the cover smells like petroleum oil
I bought this camera for my teenage son. The only problem we have found so far is that the battery life is too short. Other than that, it is a good camera. The slim design is nice, and the camera is loaded with features
This was strickly a replacement for an old solver that I have had. ---  --- Would not want to be without one as I am an avid crossword puzzle --- solver. ---  --- Many thanks for the prompt service I was given by Amazon
This is very good roasted seaweed.  Excellent, in fact.  Most companies just dry their seaweed but let me tell you, they are lazy and really don't know seaweed.  See, that's the problem with most of the world today, laziness!  I can remember a time when companies and people cared about going the extra mile, when quality still mattered.  It's a shame.  Everyone is all about speed and convenience, speed and convenience.  It's like we're all on treadmills or really fast escalators or something quick and automated like that.  I just don't know what is wrong with everyone.  Sometimes I just have to sit down and shake my head.  ---  --- Roasting makes the seaweed almost taste like chicken and when you use it in your favourite recipes, you will think you've died and gone to heaven.  Yamamotoyama is the best! 
This "Special Addiction" DVD of "Reefer Madness from Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment is truly awesome!!! Includes BOTH Original Black and White and Colorized Versions of the now cult classic!!! Plus some great extras too,including 2 commentaries and the hilarious "Gandpa's Marijuana Handbook"! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!
I myself is a Proform treadmill customer and tortured by their customer services. I also found some reviews on the internet mentioning their machines broke down in several months after purchase. (Mine in three months.) The strategy of the customer service is basically make wild guesses of what went wrong and send you the parts asking you to replace it by yourself. (In one occasion, they even asked me to take off the motor and find a local garage to test the motor to see if it's good.)These back-and-forth guessing games normally drag on for months, and eventually they claim the warranty expired and they can no longer serve you, even though it's still within one year. --- I believe you are looking for a treadmill for exercise, not to practice your debate skill over the phone with some customer service keep saying: "this is our policy.
The description of features claim the clock records outdoor temperature & it has no such feature
I wouldn't waste my time buying anything from this company. We purchased the Train table for a Christmas gift and while assembling it on Christmas eve there were quality issues. Several drilled holes were not drilled in the proper position and the table surface had several deep scratches. I called and e-mailed the company several times to try and obtain replacement parts and never got a response. Most companies want you to contact them when you need replacement parts rather than returning it to the store, but not KidKraft
Boy, this is way too much to pay for a hood on this lens.  It's a great a lens, but this is hardly worth the price
I was so very disappointed with this cereal. It's taste is very sweet. ---  --- If you look at the ingredients, it's filled with sugar, corn syrup and and more sugar.  I counted 12 ingredients that were really just forms of sugar!  It is also loaded with salt.  I would give this ZERO stars if I could, because it has more sugar than most "sweet" cereals.  Why mislead the public into thinking they are making a healthy choice when all you are doing is serving sugar with a new label and adding a little bit of soy to the package? ---   Absolutely ridiculous
This is perfect for any Kurt Cobain/Nirvana fan. It looks great, definitely reminiscent of the Smells Like Teen Spirit music video. I bought it as a gift but almost kept it for myself! If you are thinking of getting it, I would recommend you do so. You won't be disappointed
It is fun!  And most importantly educational. It has a game where you have to put the exact amount of money in the game slot.  My kids like that part. They are 6 and 7 and ask me all the time if they can play their spongebob game, we are a two leapster family but they have to share their cartridges.  Next year my youngest will want one too, I am sure, as she wants to play theirs,but she is just too little yet, another year she will be 4 so will check into getting her one of her own then..
I don't know what to say about this book. It is the single worst book I have ever read in my young life.  I feel like I've witnessed a horrible tragedy and am at a loss for words to describe it.  I would say at some point in the book, maybe about halfway, every line of dialogue, every characterization, every plot point, is absolutely terrible.  This book is truly an offense to literacy, and I cannot understand how a publisher of any merit or author could publish and print this trash.  I can only imagine that Robin Cook either allowed a child to write this book,or was chronically drunk while writing it. Either that or he has lost his faculties altogether. I have read children's essays that have been better written. --- While it would take a novel to explain all the problems with this book, the highlights are: --- -knowing the mystery 50 pages into the book and being forced to painfully watch the dumb characters discover the mystery --- -cliche mania with lines like, "I going to get to the bottom of this mystery" and when the character's discover something, giving each other high-fives. --- -racist remarks about blacks living in harlem about how they like to steal televisions, own guns, and play basketball. --- -stereotype characters such as mafioso that like to eat spaghetti and named dominick and vinny. --- -incredible suspension of disbelief when the heros, nyc coroners, fly off to africa on a moments notice because they want to finish their case of a dead body. (also paying for their friends to come too) --- -wandering around the main installation easily where the evildoers are working, and asking questions, and getting answers to them real easy. --- -incredible annoying characters that make inappropriate jokes. (i.e. making sarcastic remarks to a guy holding a gun on them) --- -the book spirals into total madness in the last 50 pages to a beyond implausible ending. I got a sense whoever wrote the end of book was on sleeping pills when he wrote it. --- If anyone thinks this book is better than two stars, they need their head examined.
During the time I was considering buying this model, I happen to see the same thing at a local department store; so I bought it. I couldn't wait to take it back. --- I wasn't impressed with the cheap plastic. The pump came with the adapter pre set for a Schrader valve; my tires are Presta. The blister pack says it can be used for both and indicates all one has to do is to take off the "round end", remove and reverse the plastic adapter, re insert and then screw on the cap [tight as per the label]. Seemed simple enough, so, I took off the cap, took out the plastic insert [I noticed it is in 2 parts], reversed and re inserted and then replaced the cap. When I put the end on the Presta valve and then pressed down on the "thumb part", I couldn't help but notice that the plastic would not grab the valve, but was loose. So I decided to change back to the Schrader type [and use my adapter valve]; maybe this would be a tighter fit. So, I took off the cap, and tried to remove the insert, but only one part of it came out; the parts separated; I could not remove the "bottom" half. I was not going to force it out. I put the parts back together, re inserted them into the blister pack and returned it. No thanks !!! --- I gave this product 1 star only because of the way this review process is set up; it doesn't deserve any star or any consideration for purchase
this toy is a ripoff for 1/2 yr. olds and you'll get annoyed couase the games are SOOOOOOOOOOO hard even for me a 12 year old and in stead you should try out this game its an internet game its better than fat Tamagotchi and if you drop the tmagotchi in water it dies 4evr 4evr and evr FOREVER DO YOU HEAR ME!!!!! ---  --- go to [...] --- you wont regret it!! ---  --- or you can laugh at me i dont car
A really cool digital picture frame, very simple to use and supports all types of memory cards even a pen drive
As mentioned, this book is amazingly compact, cramming three semesters of calculus and a bit of ordinary differential equations into just 800 pages. That conciseness also implies that much explanatory material and many illustrative examples are missing. ---  --- The authors mention in the preface that "classifiers of calculus books would call this a traditional book. Most theorems are proved or left as exercises to prove..." Nearly every result in this book has an accompanying proof. For those with a serious interest in mathematics, this is a useful resource. For most others, the presence of so many proofs can be overwhelming and probably is a turnoff. ---  --- Included with the book is a one-page detachable reference card containing a massive amount of valuable information, including common rules for derivatives and integrals, geometric formulas, a few conversion factors, trigonometric identities and graphs (very useful!), and more. The book also has a three-page comprehensive table of integrals in the inside back cover and a listing of geometric formulas in the front, along with a commemorative timeline and portraits featuring the deceased European males who made calculus possible. ---  --- Given all of this, I would highly recommend this book as an 800-page calculus reference text, or maybe as a text in an honors calculus sequence that expects to use the text throughout multiple semesters - then using it saves you money. ---  --- But for those who don't have a super-strong background or interest in math, those who are just taking calculus for a requirement or those who have never seen calculus before, or for those who are just plain math-phobic - using this book just doesn't make any sense. I wouldn't recommend it. ---  --- For those who are stuck with this book for a course, I'd suggest looking for another book to help you out. One possible book has already been mentioned in another review: Silvanus Thompson and Martin Gardner's "Calculus Made Easy", a book that dates back originally to 1910 (!). I've read parts of it, and the book looks good to me. ---  --- I'm sure that there are many other helpful books; try checking your local/university library or looking on Amazon for ideas. An extra calculus textbook that's more student-friendly might be a good idea. ---  --- As for the pages falling out, I haven't had a problem with it (I have the 8th edition), but I don't use the book all that much. ---  --- I haven't found any serious errors in the text, but I haven't read everything thoroughly, having only used the text for Calc III. ---  --- And, yeah, getting the student solutions manual would probably be a good idea
If you don't have the blues,this record will give them to you.Musically speaking ,it's tripe
First off I own both NBA 2K6 and NBA Live 2006 and have been playing both since they have come out.  At first I thought that NBA Live 2006 was a better game until I played NBA 2k6 more and more and realized that it was the best simulation basketball game out there.  The addition of the shot stick to this year's game changes the way you shoot as well as play the game.  The game is very enjoyable especially with friends because some of the games can get very intense.  Overall the game is probably the best in the series because it made a major improvement over ESPN 2k5. ---  --- Pros --- -Graphics are the best of any basketball game on the PS2 to date. --- -Free throws more realistic in that you must have a fluid motion as if you were shooting the free throw yourself. --- -VIP is very extensive and detailed to show your stats and tendecies which is a very nice touch to those that pay attention to detail such as myself. ---  --- Cons --- -Steals happen way too often. --- -Very challenging to get 15+ rebounds. --- -Practice mode is still relatively useless other than to perfect your timing on your shot.
Conde Nast Traveler is a magazine for the wealthy or the want-a-bees.  The magazine is geared mostly to North America and Europe.  It tells where to eat, shop or be seen on the two continents.  For example, an article will inform the reader of a new five-star Sushi restaurant in Florence, Italy.  Thus, if you plan to travel to Florence for Sushi (not Michelangelo), this is the magazine for you.  It is a great coffee table magazine for the armchair traveler, for the pictures are gorgeous. ---  --- 
Im going to rate this product a 2 because I like it but I would change a few things if I could.  It does show you a lot of chords and how to play properly and all that good stuff.  The couple of things I would change is the fact that when they are teaching you a chord, you can play along with the program but its only about 15 seconds, then  you have to stop and click play again.  I wish there was an option where  you could choose to repeat it on its own a few times so you dont have to stop every time to play it again.  The other thing is something a little more important.  The product has a program where you could go online to down load a lot of songs to play, its called OLGA.  Well this website is having legal problems and is not online anymore.  So you dont have that option of learning to play your favorite songs from the Beetles or Metalica or The Grateful Dead or anyone else, and thats what they advertise "Play hit songs". So overall, knowing all this I would have shopped around more.  Especially for the price, its defenitly not worth 40-50 dollars when all you get is little 15 second examples on jingle bells and little traditional folk songs. 
I bought this camera a year ago, the camera is goog only for outdoor use with a lot of light, but for using indoor (with flash) is very, very bad. When you use flash the photo are not good, but if you go to beach this may be a regular choice, if you can bought another camera.
I do agree that the quality is nothing to sneeze at.  These fill me up, I know that they're pretty good for you, and I like the nutty essence too.  I guess that I really was disappointed in the taste, though.  The chocolate was slightly bitter-tasting, and took me by surprise.  I love the other flavors, but this one is my leat favorite.  I would recommend the almond butter balls before this one, they're soft and a little more on the sweet side
I give it two stars for the Snorkel, the mask and the fins are just JUNK!!  --- The Mask: The mask is a purge mask...meaning it has a small disk that, in theory,lets you blow any excess water that enters the mask by just blowing. The problem is this, any speck of debris that gets caught between the disk or a simple malformation will cause water to constantly enter the mask. AND if you happen to suck in via your nose you'll definately get a mask full of water. ---  --- The Fins: The're a strap type fin which is good BUT they are so tight you can't wear any dive booties or dive socks which comes in quite handy if you're walking over coral, rocks or any other sharp objects. The biggest issue with the fins is the strap comes off while swimming. This set was for my wife and hers came off I didn't think to much of it until mine did too. You might say, buy smaller fins but they run in a Size x to Size X so you can't buy any smaller.  ---  --- The Snorkel is ok, It's a little short but it works
The information contained within this book was extremely out of date with a strong emphasis on steroids. It is a shame there are not more current and useful books for pet owner out there on this widespread problem.
I thought this would be the ultimate gym bag. The main compartment is too narrow. Your shoes will not fit side by side, you have to stack them. The pockets do not expand wide enough and are not deep enough. The zippers are cheap and stick. It is very pretty but not very functional. My $16.00 bag works much better. --- 
My kids really like to eat this as an after-school or late-night snack.  However, they like it best when it has been heated for 90 seconds instead of the 60 seconds recommended on the package.  My oldest takes it to high school as part of his lunch because it is so quick and he has only 30 min for lunch
This kit is just junk. The "deluxe blower brush" is a cheap plastic blower in the tiniest size. There is a "tweezers" that is just folded aluminum sheet metal - there's no way that is getting anywhere near my cameras. There are a few sheets of lense tissue and a few swabs to use with the cleaning solution. The "lintless cleaning cloth" is an about 3" x 5" piece of something akin to reusable paper towels that you'll use about three times and then throw away. This kit is not worth buying at any price, because it's not worth the shipping charges
I bought this camera for myself at Christmas. It is my first digital camera purchase. I love the clarity of the pics. I love the shutter speed! --- I do wish the lens cap would stay on better, but that is so minor compared to my likes of the camera.
Won't even cut hairs you stick directly into the blade. The shape and slots of the housing covering the blade would only cut hair that was as dense as a forest, and then only if you shoved it in hard
I tried as hard as I could but just could not get into this book.  Not quite as bad as her book, "Impossible," but close.  Danielle Steel is getting so repetitive in her writing.  Basically, this book repeated over and over how much Quinn liked sailing and how he neglected his wife throughout the years and that he didn't realize how much she meant to him until she was dying/dead.  Drivel.  She could have elaborated on what was supposedly the storm of the century but ended it quickly or expanded on the characters themselves, but no.  A waste of time.  Very hard to get through as there really is nothing there to get into at all.  Disappointing, to say the least. 
I am no pro at grilling, but this grill makes it all so easy!  It was easy to put together, easy to use, and easy to clean up.  Everything I toss on it turns about perfectly grilled and absolutely yummy!  There are cheaper charcoal grills out there, but if you're a petite woman, like me, who doesn't grill for a living, it is well worth the extra money for the little conveniences of this grill.  I got the 18 1/2 inch grill, and it has plenty of room for preparing dinner for 4-6 adults.  Since putting my grill together, I have cooked out every weekend
I have read every Hiaasen novel, except "Flush" and "Naked Came the Manatee." I have enjoyed reading almost every one of them [There are exceptions -- "Basket Case" definitely was not up to the mark, IMHO]. The best among them, in my opinion, are  "Strip Tease", and "Double Whammy." "Double Whammy" is funnier among the two. "Strip Tease" is a little more serious. ---  --- This is one novel I read once in a while whenever I get the urge to laugh out loud. Those characters are crazy
I pulled the lid of the Philosphy Vanilla Birthday Cake bottle and inhaled the wonderful smell of vanilla birthday cake.  It smells 100% like its glorious namesake.  While some people complain about feeling strange bathing in birthday cake or a strawberry milkshake, I think of it as being just another type of aromatherapy.  Cake makes me happy, birthdays make me happy, this birthday cake smelling body wash and shampoo really makes me happy!   ---  --- Plus as a bodywash and shampoo it functions very well.  My skin feels smooth, and my hair feels light, silky and not weighed down.  My hair still smells a little like birthday cake, which isn't as good the second day, but it's not overpowering.  I don't think I will use this as my everyday shampoo, but it is great to throw in a gym bag for a quick after-workout shower
We (my husband and I) brought this toy for our 2 year old last Christmas because then she was an Elmo fanatic. She still plays with this toy even though her intrests have shifted to Dora! At first I wasn't quite sure what this thing did except make noise but as I watched her play with it, I realized it taught her to follow directios. --- It's a mode where elmo asks you to follow the light and the keys light up one by one as you press them and I was truly amazed at my baby actually following the directions. --- This toy also teaches numbers. Overall, this toy is great for toddlers and tends to stay a favorite unlike those toys that end up at the bottom of the toybo
Download takes awhile, but the picture quality was great, even full screen. It played all the way through. And, to boot, it's an excellent show
This game did what the prequels couldn't for me... it drew me back into the Star Wars universe with a vengence.  I am not a real big gamer, and really don't like console games but this game is a must have for any fan, casual or hardcore.  Knights also comes in a PC version for those who don't have access to a console or like me don't really care for them.  In fact the PC version has more Mods available for it I believe so I would probably recommend it first. ---  --- Knights, or Kotor as it is known in the fan community is set 4000 years before A New Hope.  It's the sweeping tale of a talented Padawan who comes late to the Force and holds the fate of the galaxy in their hands.  Since this is an RPG the best part is the Jedi is YOU!  What really drew me to this game was the well developed storyline and the flushed out characters.  The other members of you party have backstorys that play directly into the plot in the form of sidequests during the course of the game.  You almost feel like they are real and I found myself becoming emotionally attached to the party memebers as the story progressed.  Their responses are also influenced by your dialog choices, and can even affect the main character's relationships with the other party members.  This is a Bioware game as well so there is the option to romance one of the other party members.  You can also choose which side of the Force to follow.  The player can either be the quintessential Light Jedi, evil as Palpatine, or somewhere inbetween.  Your choices throughout the game affect your alignment in the Force and also what powers are less exhausting to use. ---  --- The dialog is fantastic and rarely comes off as cheesy (unlike certian prequals which shall remain nameless) and the voice actors who portray the other characters are wonderful.  Even the dialog for the main character has the option to be funny without necessarily gaining you dark side alignment.   ---  --- The game gives you the choice to play as a male or female character which actually influences what side quests you can pick up, as well as having a minor effect on the main story.  Personally I thought this was the most gratifying aspect of the game.  I got to play as a kickin female Jedi who holds the fate of the galaxy in her hands.  Due to this as well as the ability to choose your alignment there are four possible endings to this game. ---  --- Knights has been able to hold an excellent replay factor as well due to the number of Mods available for the game from other fans.  LucasArts actually encourages and even supports fan mad mods on thier website.  When you get bored with the main storyline there are mods out there that change everything from looks to clothes to Force Powers and even dialog.  There's even a Mod out there that restores the cut fifth ending that was only available as a female character. ---  --- The game mechanics are pretty easy to get a handle on.  The combat options give you the ability to either choose what attacks each character in your party use or leave them automated.  Those who aren't real familiar with computer games should be able to pick up the basics fairly fast.  Those who like first person shooters may find it a little frustrating as the attacks themselves are automated.  For me this was a plus as I'm not a fan of "button smashers." ---  --- A work of advice to someone who hasn't played the game or isn't familiar with it's storyline, avoid searching on the internet for info on it as much as possible.  This may be frustrating if you are someone who likes getting walkthroughs but believe me, the storyline's twist is not something you want to spoil.  You'll enjoy the game storyline much more if you don't spoil the surprise.  There are gaming sites where you can get cheats and only cheats if your a cheater like me. ---  --- Not only will teen players enjoy it but I know plenty of 20 and 30 somethings who adore this game.  It does a great job of capturing the feel of the Original Trilogy.  If you like Star Wars at all, run... don't walk and buy this game
This isn't a full review but some thoughts I've had after using it for a long time. --- Stabilization- The fact is that if this is the camera you take everywhere with you, you are going to either lose shots or have to use the flash. If flash doesn't bother you, no sweat. But I've never like the look of it. --- Ease-of-use- Great. --- Voice memo- I use this feature all the time. It would be nice if it had a pause button because without it I end up with many small files. --- Ex- This is where you set the exposure. Casio does a great job putting everything in one place. The only thing they should have done better is that if you have changed a selection (e.g. ISO 200 to 400) and hit the shutter release it should take the shot. Instead nothing happens. You have to click set first. It's an extra step that you have to make during a critical time
I spend hours pouring over reviews trying to decide which ultracompact was the best deal and the best overall camera.  In the end, it came down to Panasonic's FX01 and Cannon's SD600.  I read the warnings from other reviewers that the Panasonic's images weren't top quality, but I chose to ignore those reviewers because on paper the FX01 looks like it would out perform the SD600.  I was wrong. ---  --- After using the FX01 for a few days I knew what those other reviewers were talking about - grainy photo after grainy photo.  I really really wanted this camera to be great, but it just wasn't.  Actually, my old 3mp camera took better shots then the 6mp FX01!  Very disappointing.  I ended up returning this camera to Amazon (very easy-great service) because of the poor image quality.  I mean, wanting good photographs is why you take photos, right?  I know someone with the SD600 and he's very happy with the quality.  Judging by the customer images on the SD600's page on amazon, I think I should've gone with Cannon
This was a great movie.  True the Cube was a trap but it showed the greatest danger was the people inside. ---  --- If you do an indepth look  you will realize  all the names of th epeople inside the cube are names of prisons in 4 different countries, and furthermore  their personalities decribe what the prison is like. ---  --- Kazan (autisic guy) come from  Kazan Prion in Russia  which is a psychiatric prison ---  --- Alderson  comes from  Alderson prison in West Virginia.  This prison commonly uses isolation as a punishment.  Alderson died alone having never ran into anyone. --- Rennes  comes from Rennes Prison In France.  Rennes was kinda the groups mentor.  He showed them 2 tips on how to survive, the  ---  group took these as policy.  Rennes Prison is where most of modern prison policy originated. ---  --- Holloway comes from Holloway Prison in England.  Holloway is a prison for women ---  --- Leaven And Worth come from Leavenworth Prison in Kansas --- Leavenworth has stict rules so does math wicj Leaven is a whiz at. --- Leavenworth was bulit corportely by architects.  Worth was an architect. ---  --- Quentin comes from  San Quentin prison in California.  Both Quentin's are brutal. ---  --- The makes of this movie really did their home work to make those connections. --- The plot was good also,  total strangers  with their memory of how they got there wiped out have to rely on each other to survive
Extremely dissapointed in the colors I received.  Out of 10, 6 were black, 3 red (2 shades), 1 pink.  I could deal with 6 blacks and 4 different (and I mean different - not all red-toned) colors, but not with what I got.  Useless. ---  --- I'm upset beyond words.  Will never buy from this seller again, and will not recommend to anyone I know, unless the seller comes through and fixes this
I have had a Weber Silver B grill for several years.  The grill is great, but the steel flavorizor bars rust and have to be replaced (I replaced my bars twice in five years).  I have just started using the SS bars, but I am sure they will be better than the old bars, and well worth the extra initial cost.  If I had been able to get the SS bars earlier (not usually available from local markets), I probably would not have had to replace the bars as I did (twice).  I highly recommend spending the extra dollars for SS bars when the originals fall apart
On the advertisement, these sandals were shown in green.  If they were available in green, I would be interested.  Please advise.  Thank
I was skeptical when I first heard they were making a "Freddy vs Jason" movie. The chances of getting it totally wrong seemed quite high. After viewing the film, however, I was pleasantly surprised. The plot makes a twisted kind of sense, the performances by Robert Englund and Ken Kirzinger are inspired and enthusiastic, and the special effects are top-notch. ---  --- As a Nightmare on Elm Street fan, I was pleased that the movie seemed to fit the tone of previous Nightmare movies. I was, however, intrigued by the Jason backstory and scenes. Since then I have become a fan of the Friday the 13th pictures also. ---  --- If you like either franchise, you will most likely enjoy Freddy vs Jason. Even though the final battle might not end the way you would prefer
When I tried this program out, I at first had some trouble running it. But Then I went to the website at: www.kutoka.com and click on the support tab and then select EasySpeak Spanish. They give you a link for the version of Flash 8 you need to run. After this everything worked well. ---  --- While some may have been offended by bathing suits. Not me and not my kids. There is absolutly nothing obscene here folks.  ---  --- This program is the best thing going for learning spanish quickly! And it is fun to use with the many games and puzzles that you work out with real life scenerios. Very artistic and fun. You can go to the bank, the hospital, and several different places, learn a new set of words and situations. that you could really use in a foreign country. My hats off to the designers and creators of this program. Well done!! Bravo! Muy Bien. 
I love my new seat cover. It was very easy to install over my seats. --- Nice product
greetings exelente product and magnifies attention from the store thanks kindly domenico pascarell
Metheny's an innovator and has been all over the map over his long career in terms of styles, moods, textures, and sounds. ---  --- Here we have an early effort in which he takes his guitar and overdubs an introspective, wide-open-spaces musical journey across America, weaving in jazz, folk, country, rock, mountain music, and everything in between.  If you love his work on Joni Mitchell's Amelia (performed live on Shadows and Light), you'll love the sound of this record. ---  --- The mood is mellow but not dull, quiet but not silent, and the results are spectacular.  This is the cd to take with you on a trip across the western frontier, or a short hop to Burger King.  Works either way
I was very pleased with the order and the speed at which it was delivered. More important, my grandson loves it. It was what he wanted and could not find it here so was very glad for AMAZON
This platter is suitable for serving a main entree, as it is bigger than the average plate.  Metal insert comes out easily for cleaning.  Have owned it for over a year, and it has been durable. No complaints
Isn't it frustrating when a book spends a lot of time building up the problem-to which you say, "Yeah! yeah! That's me!" and then gives you no answer, or a weak one to which you say, "No duh!" I'm afraid this book is one of them. The title is misleading because you assume he will help you find the life you've only dreamed of, or at least point you in the right direction to get started! But I was left depressed after reading it because it basically says that God gives us desires that we can't have on earth so that we will long for Him and Heaven. I don't believe that's the abundant life Jesus promised. So I went to the Bible. (I should have gone there first!) I looked up every time it talks about desires and got my answer. "Delight yourself IN THE LORD and He WILL give you the desires of your heart!" Ps. 37:4 So I set out to seek Him. I started reading "Knowing God" by J.I. Packer and began to get answers to all my questions about desire! I hope you'll find them too-in Him
 This is humor? When does the humor begin? Is it close to the end cause I reckon that this ain't funny. Maybe the fans of this guy can go home and beat there spouses with banjos and leave the rest of us alone, I reckin
I think some of the reviewers here did not use the program more enough, am using it since version 2 till now as an illustrator this program can't be beated... gradient fill was so stupid to create in earlier versions of adobe illustrator u must create two objects then blend them together to form a gradient fill then you have to mask it within a path or the shape you are filling, one more thing the mask in corel "container" is a wonderful tool to have much better than the mask used in illustrator that sucks (u have to see me pulling out my hear if i made i mistake using it) do you want more i have a lot to mention. ---  --- Am using both program everyday know them very well and to be honest i do all the artwork in coreldraw then i export to illustrator for color separation and printing and that becuase the printers agancies in my country don't know how to use corel so i have to ride the wave and finalize thing in illustrator. ---  --- I do all detailed drawings precisely using the guidelines and grid (first in available in corel) creating layouts, realistic objects or models with shadings and shadowing as well with ease this software is so powerfull if you are a real artist you must get i
I've had multiple PDA's that have crashed and multiple phones in the past.  I had a great Nokia phone, but wanted to combine into one unit so I decided to try the Dash about 6 months ago.  So far, I've had no issues with service.  Been able to make and receive phone calls, call clarity is excellent and with TMobile, I have service in my office unlike other co-workers phones.  Everyone is jealous - their pda phones are much larger and not as nice looking.  I really enjoy having the email and internet feature.  The only issue I've had at all is with the volume control - when I'm surfing the net or playing ball breaker, I hold the phone and often hit the volume control.  Everything else works as described and I'm very happy with my choice. ---  --- When I was looking to combine my phones, I was comparing this phone to the blackberry and after reading many reviews, I picked this one.  I'm very happy I did. ---  --- [...
This bench is fabulous and the cushions are a very good quality.  We purchased the entire collection and could not be any happier.  They were boxed superbly so there was no damage at all and the quality is amazing...obviously we love this product!
I bought one of these items in December '04 from Adorama.  It had directions written in raised letters on the canister itself.  I just ordered here and received a second one in March '07 and the "new" model has no instructions.  Other than that, it looks identical to the old one, so I assume the contents are the same. --- Here are the exact words written on the old one: --- "HYDROSORBENT 40 GRAM SILICA GEL" --- "WHEN PINK, REACTIVATE 3 HOURS AT 300F" --- The pink referred to is the little circle in the center of the canister. ---  --- I keep this product with my camera (in closed stuff sack) and it seems to work as advertised - though I guess you just have to have faith that it does - no easy way to prove it (except maybe in extremely humid climes)
The recipes are great and so is the travel advice for those seeking a good meal while traveling. I get great ideas for presentation and entertaining at home. If you enjoy fine dining, or just reading about it, then this magazine is worth a subscription and would make a nice holiday gift that will keep giving year roun
Animal House raised the bar, and set a standard for all comedies that followed. Many have tried to duplicate the originality of this movie, and all have failed to come close. ---  --- A classic for the ages
I PURCHASE THIS PHONE FOR MY DAUGHTER FOR XMAS. AND IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTED.I ALSO WAS VERY PLEASE WITH IT
This game matches with the real thing quite well, but has too few questions to endure.  If you've never seen the show, it's simply a series of fifteen, each increasing in dollar amount until the last, million-dollar question.  It's drawn out.  There's a speech clip for each dollar amount, answer, and other things.  The infamous "final answer" option only appears when you take a while to answer, unfortunately.  The lifelines are realistic, minus the fact that "phone a friend" is really "phone Regis's friend".  The "fast finger" scrambles the choices, and the first correct key pressed wins.  The graphics are pretty good and there are neat animations.  I recommend this for Millionare fanatics or trivia people, but only those who won't run out of questions
this ramp is terribly designed for a skateboard. First of all, i thought this would be a bit larger. When i tried to go off of the ramp, my nose hit the front of it.  --- Not only is it not fun, but you need to weigh it down if you dont want to slide around. If you are considering purchasing this item for use with a skateboard,i recommend something else.
This was a cute product, but only lasted a day.  Perhaps my preschool boys' punches were just too much for this bag.  A patch was included, but it seems that air is leaking from the seams.  Oh well.
i wanted to get someone an assortment of teas for the holidays, and this was the perfect combo. they're really enjoying trying all the different kinds.
My recipe for Iced Green Tea Latte.  1 teaspoon (approx 4 gms) green tea powder, A pinch (1gm) of soy protein powder, 1 tablespoon sugar - mix with 1 tablespoon hot water and let seep for 2 mins.  Add milk (8-10 oz) and ice
I bought this lamp because it says it doesnt give off any glare and is easy on the eyes for reading, doing crafts, sewing........... Well it doesnt giove off much light either!!!! So you need another source of light in your work area also......... I didnt think it would fill up the room with beautiful NATURAL light but c'mon.........all in all its an overpriced night light!!
I purchased these for my Pack N' Play, and they are soft and durable.  A real must-have for pack-n-play owners
     I always thought Clue looked like a complicated game I'd never touch!  That is until I played it at my friends house!  Now I'm a Clue fanatic trying to collect all the versions!  This game can never get old because it's a different outcome every time!  I strongly reccomend it to anyone 8 and older
Cheap. Simple. Good looking. --- The only thing missing is a belt clip.  There are stick on belt clips that work fine with this
I was very excited to hear that this new Muppets Holiday offering was coming!  The previous two Christmas albums ("A Christmas Together" w/ John Denver & "A Muppet Christmas Carol") have long been family favorites at hour house in December.  However, this time I am disappointed. ---  --- Most of the songs performed on this cd include voices not done by the original puppeteers that made them famous.  I realize it is impossible to perfectly duplicate the voices to match the puppeteers that are no longer with us.  But, to focus on these voices so much (Kermit, Rowlf, Dr. Teeth, Statler & Waldorf, The Swedish Chef) in this album, only produces a disappointing reminder that the "Muppets" we grew up with are long gone. ---  --- Maybe I am being a little hard on this cd.  But, there are plenty of Muppets they could have focused on for this project that are still performed in the original voices (Robin, Sam, Honeydew & Beaker, Rizzo, Louzeland, etc).  Those voices added to those of Ganzo, Miss Piggy and Fozzie would have made for a more familiar feel. ---  --- There are a couple of good cuts on the album.  One is "Merry Christmas" by Pepe.  The other is "Santa Baby" by Miss Piggy. ---  --- Sadly, over all I can not recommend this cd.
I have been looking high and low for a fragrance that wasn't strong.  I have tried so many perfumes and body sprays it is ridiculous.  I have finally found the one I will use for more than a week.  I love it!   ---  --- The smell is so clean and simple.  The first day I wore it I had 3 seperate people tell me I smelled good.  I have NEVER had even one person tell me that, let alone 3.  I was amazed.  Also, I noticed that they told me I smelled good.  They didn't say your perfume smells good.   ---  --- I am not sure how to describe the smell.  It reminds me of that out-of-the-shower fresh smell that we wish we could have all day.  I will never use any other fragrances but Philosophy fragrances.  I plan on trying all their other wonderful scents as well
We have to use this book for the college class that I'm taking and it is a horrible book. I often find myself looking for help on the internet rather than going to this book. It is poorly organized, I have to go to the index in order to find something I specifically need because the book isn't in any order. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. Find another there are many more
When I bought the XBox on 6-11-06 it came at a very good rate of time, my son enjoyed it then as we returned from a vacation he turned it on and we saw smoke I don't feel paying for an item at this price was fair to only have it for two months. I can't say the  person that sold me the XBox has even tried to email me since I've emailed him , hmmmm.
This is the first of Alison's album's that I bought, many years ago.....I've watched her career blossom.....she was an unknown when she recorded this album but in my opinon, it's her best!  True bluegrass, beautiful voice, wonderful music!  I've had the opportunity to see her and the band in concert several times and their music never leaves me disappointed
I love this cleanser!!! I have combination skin and I sometimes have breakouts, especially when I am stressed. This cleanser is great because it sloughs off the dead skin without irritation. I also love how it doesnt dry out my skin! And I have a lot less breakouts now, and when I do, its not as bad as it used to be. Even if you have sensitive skin, this cleanser is perfect, of course there are other great cleanser options if you think this will irritate your skin. Also, this cleanser really helps to minimize/clean out your pores. I really noticed a difference after using it for only a week. --- I also recommend the Perfecting Lotion especially if you have slightly oily skin. I use it during the day and even at night(!)because it really improves my skin and I dont wake up with zits in the morning :)Plus, It saves me money since i dont have to by an acne treatment gel to put under my lotion
It's to bad I can't give negative stars as this package certainly deserves them. This program is total garbage. A gargantuan waste of both time and money.  ---  --- Seemingly with every menu change, it recatalogues your entire photo collection, on ALL DRIVES, which takes HOURS (like 12+) to accomplish. And, while it will scan and catalogue all of the drives on your computer, don't even think about selecting a folder and expecting it to display the contents of that folder and all of it's subfolders. Ain't a gonna happen... but is will happily go through and catalogue them again for you, but, of course, after waiting hours for the software to finish catalogueing, it doesn't display the contents.  No, that would be way to logical. ---  --- After realizing that my computer had slowed to a crawl, I checked the memory usage and found that the Corel Photo Album 6 Deluxe was using 6 to 7 times higher than any other program running, and that includes Norton Internet Security, a notorious memory hog! Guess we now know what the DELUXE part is! ---  --- As far as I am concerned, Corel Photo Album 6 Deluxe is neither intuitive nor is it the "Best of" anything. It is a creeping, bloated dinosaur and a total waste of your hard earned money.
It's just what I wanted. I pulled out the removable sections because I prefer a slimmer feel.
I have a 6 month old who absoutely loves this walker.  We started using this when he was only 4 months old and being the wiggly, active baby he is, he loved being able to push himself around. Now, along with his "walking", he loves to push the buttons to hear the music and see the lights.  Along with that, he likes to pull and pet the plush toys on the side while "chatting" with them.  This is a great walker; just always remember to keep an eye on baby at all times! I highly recommend this for those babies who love to move around on their own.  It also provides mom and dad with about 25+ minutes of catch-up-with-to-do-list time!!
I bought a couple of Bob vidoes through Amazon for my son, age nearly 2, who loves the series. We were crushingly disappointed by these videos, though. The wonderful voices of the UK version (Neil Morissey et. al) have been replaced by American voices. WHY do they do that? For us it means the videos are unplayable because they just ain't Bob. British shoppers and anyone familiar with the original Bob should be warned. (Can I get my money back?
I had to upgrade to MS Works 7.0 due to Y2K issues. I am not nearly as satisfied with MS Wortks 7.0 as I was with MS Works 4.5. I am now searching for a replacement
I finally got a DS and one of the first "older" games I tried to hunt down for this wonderful system was Phoenix Wright.  I've been "Jonesing" for this game for awhile now.  It's unique and entertaining.  The choices for the court sections can be kind of linear but it's too much fun to not "love" this title. ---  --- This is the type of game that makes the DS so unique and proud to say that "I own this system".  More games should take note and follow in it's footsteps.  This is a must buy for any DS library. ---  --- Other titles in this type of catagory that are must buys are: Trauma Center and Trace Memory. ---  --- This system was made for these types of games.  These games are why I will always trust in Nintendo for high quality and interesting games.  Game on!
this is exactly what i wanted--the last 1 i bought is over 10 yrs old and still going--i was afraid each day it would go out and could not find a replacement anywhere---you are a life--i mean, hair saver!! --- diane in texa
I bought this scale as an upgrade from a Wal Mart cheapo scale.  Hated it!!  I should have read the dimensions more carefully, but it was so large that it became the focal point of our bathroom.  Worse still, it never displayed the same weight twice in a row even when second weight was taken immediately after the first.  Had to reset it to zero and then the same drill happened again.  Returned the item, but ate the $11 return ship fee  - it's huge AND heavy
My kids really like the memory cards because they can keep playing there game once they get off andthey save it
My personal favorite dashboard cd.  Every other one of their cds have maybe a few good songs that I like, but the places you have come to fear the most has pretty much a solid tack lis
I'm placing my second order for the variety pack because I liked every flavor and appreciated the variety. All have a sensational blend of flavors--spicy, sweet, salty--without being overpowering. Truly delicious and healthy munchables. I'm so glad I decided to try out a package in my supermarket.
Don't be fooled by pictures, but this set is HUGE. Nicely heavy, and a bargain for the price
This movie is high in my top 10 off all times list, and is probably the best 'mainstream hollywood' movie I can think of. I watched it for the 3rd or 4th time and it is just as enjoying, thrilling and suspenseful as it was when I saw it first more than 10 years ago. My 12 years old daughter watched it with me for the first time and enjoyed it just as well. Great performance by all cast but especially Hanks, Paxton and Beacon. Probably Ron Howard best film ever
Norton is still the 800LB. Gorilla of Antivirus software, but I think more and more people are realizing that bigger does not mean better!   --- The old days when Peter Norton made an excellent antivirus program are long gone, and these days Norton is just a mass produced product of Symantec's. --- Customer service is through an Internet Database, and you must pay over $40 just to speak with someone even when Norton lets you down and lets a virus slip in.  The biggest problem is that this program is a huge hog of system resources.  It is no wonder that the ratings are so poor on Norton these days. I bought Trend Micro's PC-Cillin and have not looked back.  There product is less expensive and includes free phone support, and they have received all sorts of awards for their product
Great CD for young and old alike.  The music puts a smile on your face each time you listen to it.  I have it on in my car and it keeps me in a good mood at all times
This software is focused on learning the rules of the game.  Movement of different pieces and pawns is demonstrated through an assortment of arcade-type games.  There are some decent books for learning chess for beginners, but learning through a computer game program makes it much easier and more fun. ---  --- The program doesn't contain any instructions,so some people may find it frustrating figuring out what to do in the beginning. However, there is a symbol in the top right corner, clicking on which brings down the menu at which point navigating becomes a piece of cake. ---  --- Just knowing the rules of the game enables one to play chess, but not exactly to win, so the second CD in this series (Learn to Play Chess 2) continues where the first one left off and goes into different tactics and strategies.   ---  --- The software is recommended for 8 year-old children and older - kids at heart may have fun learning chess with this program also
the band and face are both SO MUCH darker than they look in the picture.  also, amazon neglected to send the owners manual and warranty information (I had to contact Skagen for this).  the watch is very attractive though
I will try to keep this brief... by the way I'm only 10 hrs thru... only just got out of City #1 Rabernastre, Dalmasca and now in city #2 Bahjerba (sp?): ---  --- Quickly, my first impressions of the game were strange... I was like "MEH I dunno if I want to keep playing..." but after maybe 20 min of getting of the 'wierdness' it really sucks you in. Ughh I really wish I didn't have midterms coming up so I could go home and play! ---  --- Pros: --- - Love the battle system! It's still strategy but it doesn't require you to have random battles... ughh I'd hate the "whzzzhhh" of the starting of random battles... I can still feel in control but doing less actual work. --- - Like everyone else says, CG always good. --- - Story... though not as much character development/focus as previous ones, I do like the whole war/polity centered plot. It does follow FFT's tradition. --- - I actually like the license board... some people have said it's a pain in the beginning, but so far it hasn't been the case for me... granted I did very early in the game decide to level up Vaan a bit (~40 min or so). You really just need to know to only use the board when you really need to... don't randomly buy spots on the board just as things become available as its difficult for one person to learn EVERYTHING. Plan, plan, plan. (Right now by the way I'm constructing my chars in the way the game hints at... its only one way to do it, but first time around I'll follow it... the already licensed equipment/abilities hint at what they'll be good at.) --- - HUGE game. Lots of stuff to see... and quite beautiful. --- - Character design... course there is always someone to love... (Har har har... as a fangirl I must say I love Basch :D lol... tho I love the babyface of earlier FF characters I think Vaan is too babyfaced. He looks like a kid.--haha I'm a college student and such a fangirl... haha... sad isn't it?--If I were a guy, I'd say I'd like Fran the most... this is of course subject to personal opinion.) --- - I like subs and I like how they are not bland... they have fancy font this time :D. (Kinda reminds me of Nochnoi Dozor.) Makes the game really movie-ish. --- - Widescreen capability... (Looks SWEET on my widescreen PC monitor.) --- - Course everyone always talks about the realism of selling pelts and what not... I also like that. --- - Free-moving camera... Thank heaven for that. I LOVE it. I hated the still camera immensely in FFX. --- - Cute monsters... lol love the cactuar like monster and the rogue tomato! --- - Also love how you can avoid some boss moves by skillfully moving around them. ---  --- Cons: --- - HUGE game... (yes also a con)... lots of time running around. Good thing all the characters don't run as painstakingly slow as Tidus did in FFX. ---  --- Meh... neutral: --- - Voices - I dunno what is up with people liking the previous FF's voice actors but anyhoo I thought this time there were better ones. The prev. FF's voice actors were okay but not great. Here the voice actors are really good, but the choice of some of them seems strange... like I have a problem with Fran's voice... it was a strange choice and a strange voice. Also Balthier's voice doesn't seem to go with his look, but I really do like the voice acting by itself. (In sum, some voices, though really well acted, didn't seem to fit the actor's look... however, I do favor good actors with mismatched roles over okay actors with well-matched roles so I  give the voice acting a mild thumbs up.) After reading a review which mentioned mispronunciations, I feel I must also address that... As someone who speaks some French I did twitch when I heard "Marquis" pronounced both as "Markus" and "Marquis" rather than "Markee." I also did twitch when they pronounced "fete" as "feet" rather than "feh-t." --- - Soundtrack - I liked all the music (there was a lot) taken from FFT... esp the battle music in the Estersand, I think it is... totally taken from FFT (obviously as both take place in the same world)... I did enjoy the non-midi renditions of the themes... but the rest of the new guy's music was just 'meh'... wasn't particularly bad, but it didn't really stand out much either
This is a magazine.  This is a magazine?  Do yourself a favor and pick this up if you can get it for less than $20 an issue (like I do at my local Borders).  Excellent quality
I have a 2 month old high-end Dell PC with tons of memory and disk, running Windows XP Pro.  This game doesn't work.  Period.  First of all, when I installed it, it reset my graphics options.  Second, when I attempt to play a game, even at the settings that it chose, I get nothing but a white screen.  After numerous tries, and killing the program with the task manager, I finally attempted the other Activities options.  Clicking on them does absolutely nothing!  It doesn't recognize my mouse clicks. ---  --- I'm assuming that the game was written for the Apple Mac, and ported to the PC.  Trust me, it doesn't work.   ---  --- BTW, we have tons of other kids games and have never had a problem with any of them.   ---  --- Now I have to figure out how to return this silly thing. 
i made a poopie in my pantys so you are mean i love camo hats i'm 5 and i live in new york city in a apratmant that is fancy so you are stupiodo haeds.ps im in the army
Mercifully, VH-1 hasn't released the nauseating, moron-targeting 'I Love The 90s' DVD series (yet), so you'll have to settle for a similarly appalling companion soundtrack disc. ---  --- This is precisely the kind of CD which shouldn't even exist anymore given the availability of this material on the internet, legal or illegal.  There's no rhyme or reason to the collection, and the songs you might actually want to remember...you probably already downloaded them. ---  --- The source show is easily one of the most appalling projects MTV/VH-1 has produced in some time.  It's basically a bunch of 'comedians' and third-tier celebrities talking about the 80s or 90s (or rather, the highlights of what corporate product was released in 1996, say) with such fond memories and gusto, hoping the next generation ingests this poison with the understanding that Mambo No. 5 was a 'good, memorable song' for instance. ---  --- Avoid at all costs.  Take pleasure in denying Tag Team their royalties when you find their 'classic' song on online...for free
This is the best oatmeal I've ever eaten.  We cook it overnight in a small crockpot.  A quick, hot breakfast the next morning!  You can add things to it for endless variations
Maybe if these were high end rechargable NiMH this would be a reasonable price. But for Alkaline? This is even more ridiculus than the cables they sell. You can find AAA battieries on Amazon for a third of this price
Some of the best lighting I have ever seen on face of that hunk C. Tommy.  John Peters is a genius
I eat these right out of the package. They are easy to put in my lunch box. The flavor is great I never warm them up but they would probably be even better if you did. I really like the sauce they are in. No Complaints I just like em great taste don't take up much space. But very filling. Highly recommend
Very disappointed... It didnt play any music its own & quiet difficult to squeeze.....
One thing you will find reading through many reviews is a dissatisfaction with the state filings. This is my own experience and this may be the last year I use TaxCut because of it. First of all, it would not allow me to e-file my state return but didn't explain why. I later discovered that for most states you apparently can't e-file a partial year return. Then when printing out the state return it told me I had to also include a form that was mentioned nowhere else in the program. I later found out that Taxcut does not support all state tax forms! I then had to get that form and fill it in manually, and then discovered I owed less than before because Taxcut had incorrectly calculated my capital gains. AND there was nothing on the missing state form that could not have been completed with data the program already had. ---  --- TaxCut also advised me I could save $1000 off my fed bill by contributing to an IRA. So I opened and IRA and contributed $4000. When I went back to TaxCut and entered the details it told me I wasn't eligible for any tax deduction. I was ready to be tied up! This software is seriously dysfunctional. ---  --- I'm guessing by this stage you get the idea. Bottom line: I will be looking elsewhere to complete my tax returns next year. ---  --- Oh, by the way, if like me you were unable to efile and you paid for the efile option, you can get a credit from H&R by calling 1-888-4TAXCUT option 2,2,0
This book is fantastic.  It has changed my life and I highly recommend it
I used herbalism for a few weeks after discovering lush products through a friend. My face, esp. my forehead became very greasy, and every pore on my forehead became inflamed. I thought it was stress and continued using it until my next lush run when they gave me a sample of aquamarina. My face cleared up instantly. When the aquamarina ran out I went back to herbalism, but -surprise- the skin problems reemerged. Now, I'm using aquamarina instead and love it, though you can't get it through amazon for some reason. Check the lush website. I'm sure this won't happen to everyone, but give that pink glop a try instead
This is my third heart rate monitor. I purchased this one because the battery died in my last HR watch. I thought I could replace the battery, but when I tried to replace it, I broke it. Oh well. . .  ---  --- Anyway, I purchased the Reebok Fitness HR Watch because it was on sale (50% off retail). I couldn't find any reviews on it so I "rolled the dice."  ---  --- With my two previous HR watches, it was pretty intuitive as to how to set and operate them without reading the instructions. With the Reebok HR watch, I had to read the instructions a couple of times. After a couple of training sessions, I began to feel comfortable on how to operate it and use its settings.  ---  --- There are a few PROS on the Reebok HR watch:  ---  --- (1) The chest heart rate strap will work with Precor cardio machines with heart rate monitors. ---  --- (2) The chest heart rate strap's battery is easily replaced. (I don't know about the watch.)  ---  --- (3) It has a lot of features that you'll find in higher priced HR watches.  ---  --- Now, the CONS:  ---  --- (1) The heart rate reading is much too small if you're near-sighted or need reading glasses.  ---  --- (2) The shape of the crystal cover causes a glare under certain indoor and outdoor lighting so it's difficult to read the small heart rate reading.  ---  --- In conclusion, because the heart rate reading is too small and there's a glare, I can't read the watch unless I slow down, steady my arm, and position my arm at a certain angle to deflect the glare. Because of this, I'm disappointed with this watch.  ---  --- If you've got good eyesight, you can add 1-star
This is my favorite cardio video right now.  Because the video is only 30 minutes long, I can easily fit it into my day.  I found the choreography fun and uncomplicated.  I especially love the addition of plyometric moves and core conditioning to the cardio.  I can feel those "assets" tightening up
I served in the army myself and although i haven't expirienced war myself i expirienced a lot during my service in the IDF. --- This book takes you inside the heads and lives of the grunts who went through the hell of vietnam. The figures changes during the story and you learn more and more of them, feeling like you are walking in the jungles by them. --- Someone told me this was a "hard book to read" and i didn't know what he'd meant until i finished it. this is one of my favorite books and almost the only one i've read more than once. --- a must for anyone interested in the vietnam war
Attractive wood finish as seen in the picture.  It was fairly easy to put together.  Keeps the golf stuff neat and organized. 
This was the top rated system by Consumer Reports.  I returned it.  The sound quality of the message I recorded as a greeting sounded awful as did the sound of the messages I received. Tried to record my greeting a number of ways, but they all sounded awful.
This is very heavy and hard to fit anywhere for storage. Very hard to use even when you adjust the tension to a low setting. I tried working out on it for about a week and gave up...it will most likely be tossed
I was never much of a Chili Peppers fan over the years, but I thought I'd give them a chance and listen to this disc.And just as I always thought, it's crap. Very few bands have been able to pull off the repulsive people/repulsive music combo as thoroughly as these guys have. I feel like I need a bath after just looking at their picture. As far as the "music" is concerned, the singing is awful(deadpan monotone voice), the instrumentation is very limited, and the overall production is 2nd rate. The ONLY plus, if any, is that the band manages to show some progression on the newer material, which is still not very good. The fact that this band has been successful over the years just proves that a lot of people have REALLY bad taste.         
This gate us a lifesaver.  Not only do I pets, I have a very adventurus toddler.  This gate is sturdy and very durable.  It is very convienent because it is designed to fit in an area that isnt straight.  My living room has a curve to it so it fits great.  A wonderful item.  Thank you
At first spray, this can be a pretty potent cologne, but after 1-2 minutes this fades into a nice rosey spice scent that is much lighter than it's green original polo brother. lasts all day long and into the night. Worth checking out if you are a fan of cool water and lotto, or lighter scented cologne. ---  --- 
Take a brief look at the lives of some Jewish Hungarians during WW2 in Auschwitz concentration camp. I don't think any of us can even begin to imagine the hell these people went through. Watching thousands of your friends, families and neighbors being gassed to death and then loading their lifeless bodies into crematoriums until the only thing left are their ashes you are covered in. It just goes beyond anything I can fathom. These people did what they had to do to survive just one more day in the hell they were thrown into. Would I make the same choices they had? Would it be worth living one more day, doing what they had to do? I don't know, and I do not think any one of us have the right to judge their decisions. I do know this movie does an excellent job of showing how is might of been for those poor souls
I wanted a glass hummingbird feeder and decided to try this one on my window before springing for some of the more glamorous-looking blown glass ones. I mounted it on my kitchen window, under an awning on the northeast side of the house, not at all expecting anything to happen. A ruby-throated hummingbird found it the very first day! ---  --- It took some force at first to separate the mounting bracket thing from the feeder itself. In fact, I had to drop it first for it to break loose and detach! Fortunately, nothing broke. I probably could have just soaked it in some hot soapy water and it would have come apart easily. ---  --- You can't beat glass. I'm just totally getting away from plastic these days...
Castlevania: Curse of Darkness is a game that even the die-hard Castlevania fan might not much get into. Lament of Innocence wasn't a terrible game, but it wasn't great. And Curse of Darkness just goes to show that when a 3D Castlevania game marches forth, it has problems. Sometimes scary problems. Like Lament of Innocence, it had so much potential to be good--this title more so. But it doesn't deliver, and that's a sad revelation to admit to, especially after having so much enjoyment with the DS smash: Dawn of Sorrow. ---  --- Ever since the 1997 all time best, Symphony of the Night, so many main characters in the series have to be like Alucard in SOME way. Hector in Curse of Darkness is no exception. He looks a little like Alucard. ---  --- But we're not here to discuss that. Hector is a Devil Forgemaster, one who has given up his powers. Dracula is dead, but the land is overun with the curse of monsters on the world of Valachia. Hector, however, isn't concerned about what kind of shape the world is in. He's more concerned about an evil Devil Forgemaster by the name of Issac, who has killed his beloved. If you couldn't guess, it's time for revenge. And so Issac leads Hector into a place full of traps and obstacles he must overcome. And by doing so, Hector will slowly recover his Devil Forgemaster skills and whatnot. The story actually unfolds with excellent voice-acting, but there isn't much story. ---  --- Since Symphony of the Night we've been given this Metroid style exploration when it comes to Castlevania. This is marvelous, and once again, makes its way into the 3D world of Castlevania. You explore a large castle riddled with goodies. This includes weapons, subweapons, armor and much more. ---  --- Playing the game can be quite fun. Most of the game, as you might have guessed, is spent running through endless hallways of defeating monsters. That isn't as boring as you might think. You can perform some cool looking combos on enemies, but each one must be finished with the B button. You can also lock onto enemies and perform combos. This makes the camera go crazy, though, but this is forgiveable. Battling without locking on is actually much better, and it isn't too hard to do without. Although, if you want to steal from your enemies, you'll have to lcok on to 'em. Speaking of stealing, it's nice that you can actually do that. Many a time a monster will leave himself open for stealing. This usually occurs while it recovers from taking damage. Again, you must be locked on for it to happen. ---  --- Likewise, unlike Lament of Innocence, they actually use the level up system. In other words, there's actually a point to battling through hordes of monsters this time. ---  --- You also have little helper monsters. You can compare them to the familiars found in other Castlevania games (like Symphony of the Night and Dawn of Sorror), but the better comparison would be Pokemon. They lend their assistance and gain experience from defeating enemies, just as you do. It's nice not to have to go at it alone, but we Castlevania veterans would prefer to go at it alone. Each enemy also drops evolution crystals. Collect enough of them and your monster will evolve. You won't grow to like them, though. That's the sad part, and they don't really enhance the gameplay. The monsters have special abilities, though. Golem like creatures can open heavy doors, imps let you bury underground. But you can't help but admit it would be nice if your little innocent devils were actually characters. Also, no evolution crystal is the same. You can take advantage of the system by collecting different types of crystals and seeing how your little buddies evolve. ---  --- One of the nice things about being a devil forger, you can make your own weapons! And Hector can do it at any time he wants! That's right, no running back to some stupid shop to do it! Monsters often drop raw materials, and you can use them to make new weapons or make your current weapons stronger. You can do this simply by opening the menu. I don't know about you, but that's pretty satisfying to me to be able to do that. ---  --- The weapons have their own little downside however. With the exception of the sword, none of them are highly helpful in combat. You start the game off with a short sword, and you'll grow accustomed to its fast speed and easy use. Other weapons just aren't fast enough, and enemies aren't weak to a certain weapon "type". This makes the weapon crafting system a little useless at some points. Unless you're a person who likes to use "cool" looking weapons as opposed to swift and powerful weapons, you won't have THAT much use for the weapon crafting system, except to power up your sword. Thus, experimenting with weapons garners no fun. ---  --- It is pretty cool, I must say, to be venturing somewhere that isn't Dracula's castle. Instead you actually venture through the world of Valachia. Meaning you'll trek through swamps, mountains, valleys and a lot more. So if you're tired of Dracula's castle, this is quite a change. ---  --- The problem with this "world" is that you don't see enough of it. There's not enough detail to it. You have to follow a beaten path (so it isn't really that different than Dracula's castle in Lament of Innocence), so you can't go off and just explore the places you're at. The game also suffers from what Lament of Innocence suffered from: the lack of detailed enviroments. You'll no doubt run down the same path/hall/corridor several times over. If it weren't for the map you'd find yourself lost, thinking you must be in one of those "looping" ares, or that you took a wrong turn and ended up running in a circle. ---  --- The monsters are also not so great. What I love about the 2D Castlevania games (especially in the new Dawn of Sorrow) is how much variety is thrown into the monsters. The attacks they use on you. Even if they're the same looking monster, they throw in some new attack that you don't expect. Curse of Darkness (like Lament of Innocence) has no variety. You'll run into the same batch of monsters constantly, and they'll never do something new. Later in the game you'll find yourself fighting nothing but reincarnates of different colored monsters that do nothing new. Likewise, all the monsters you'll ever see are encountered pretty early on. The moment you run into an Axe Armor, you've run into 'em all! They'll never change. ---  --- I sound like I'm being picky about the enemies thing, but I'm not. It takes away from the challenge of the game. The fact that reincarnates don't do anything new makes it more true. And that's not the worst part: the game overall just isn't a challenge. The bosses can be, at times, but if you've been playing 3D action games, I think you'll find even the more challenging bosses to be no challenge at all. The early boss battles in the game are fairly easy. Later on, however, they get start to get hard, and that's when battling them actually becomes fun. Again, though, if you're an action/adventure pro, you'll probably beat most of them on your first try. ---  --- I wish I could say the graphics are great. Hey, Hector looks great in combat. But the enviroments don't have enough detail. Too many of them are simple everyday enviroments we've been seeing for a long time now. Where's the detail? You know... like... maybe the leaves on a tree moving? We're at that point where there could be some kind of interation with the enviroment, instead of it seeming like we're running through a still-life painting. Visually, it doesn't look half bad. It's just that there could be so much more. The bosses look cool, and the framerate doesn't slow down at all, but there isn't enough variety, or detail. ---  --- However, I must say this: the music sounds AWESEOME! As usual, the Castlevania games have some of the best music there is to be heard in gaming! Is it better than Symphony of the Night? No, it's not. It isn't better than Lament of Innocence either (which also had steller music), but it is still among the best you'll ever hear in a video game. Likewise, the voice acting is actually really really GOOD! I just wish I could've heard more of it! ---  --- Curse of Darkness had the potential to be a good game. But there are a lot of things that keep it down. It's a fairly fun game to play, but it lacks innovation. You won't be able to separate it from the other action/adventure 3D games. It's got nothing that makes it stick out. ---  --- If you MUST have this game, however, I'd say wait for a price drop. If you're really looking for a good Castlevania game, I'd suggest getting a hold of "Dawn of Sorrow". It's a much better game. ---  --- The Good: --- +Great Music! Some of the best in gaming! --- +Good weapon system --- +It's pretty fun to play --- +You can steal from enemies! --- +Great Voice acting! ---  --- The Bad --- -Little innovation --- -Lack of cutscenes to advance the story --- -Too much of the game gets recycled too fast --- -Too easy --- -The game doesn't look bad, but there's little imagination in the environments --- -Not a whole lot of different enemies --- -It's too easy --- -Boring level designs (not enough of them) --- -You just can't help that the game has almost no innovation! It's no different than your average action/adventure 3D game ---  --- Get Dawn of Sorrow, or one of the other 2D versions of the game. They seem to fare so much better than this one does. Even the die-hard fan of Castlevania has to admit this one is rather bland
I have not been able to get this to work again. It was great for the first week, then it made my computer crash and now I cannot get it installed again. I am not sure I like that
This product is not very good. The speed registers at least 6 miles per hour faster than radar gun. Getting the grip on the ball correct to make it even register a speed is difficult and frustrating. Avoid this ball
The flight into New York had been a long one; but I was gently revived when Kirsten Dunst met me at the airport.  She was to be my escort that night at the Lincoln Center where the President would present me the Distinguished Writer's Cross-the highest award this nation can bestow on an author.  I quickly slipped my only suitcase in the backseat and sat next to her as she drove her Mercedes S class sedan to the Waldorf Astoria downtown. ---  --- "I have to admit that I didn't you who you were until I read STARLESS GRASSLANDS.  I don't mean to embarrass you; but that book changed my life." ---  --- I tried to be polite and gracious toward the compliment.  For the remainder of the trip we had a nice conversation while I approved the fluid motion of her hands and legs as she maneuvered the controls of the automobile.  I very much approved of her legs. ---  --- As I departed the car, Kirsten leaned toward the open door to catch my eyes. ---  --- "Don't forget.  I'll be by at seven so we can go to the ceremony together.  Please be ready." ---  --- I expressed gratitude for her generosity and promised to be waiting for her seven sharp.  The hotel staff greeted me and soon I entered the elevator for a quiet ride to the eighty sixth floor.  As I entered the suite, the steward took my request to have my suit blushed, prepared and returned in a few hours. ---  --- Finally, a bit of peace.  I poured a small measure of whiskey into a chilled tumbler and then walked over to the large window looking out over the city below.  For a few moments I contemplated the remarks I was to make at this evening's formal ceremonies, then I heard the hushed movement of stocking feet behind me across the room.   ---  --- I turned around and out of the bedroom to my left in walked Sandy Bullock dressed in a black sheer see through cat suit. ---  --- "Well, Crabby, aren't you glad to see me?" ---  --- Before I could recover from my surprise another set of feet wisped across the floor from the sitting room on the right.  It was Jennifer Aniston dressed in the same black sheet cat suit. ---  --- "Sweetheart, don't look at her.  Come here to me." ---  --- "Get out!" screamed Sandy.   ---  --- "No, you get out.  It's not fair.  I left Brad for him so I get him!" ---  --- The two of them stood in angry silence staring at each other for a tense moment.  Then Sandy leapt at Jennifer and instantly they were in a bitter fight hissing and scratching each other.  It was a ferocious sight as pulled hair, shrieks of pain, and nylon tearing could be heard.  Then almost a quickly as it began, the fighting pair disappeared into the sitting room.  Several sharp punches were heard then a definite thump as a body fell to the floor.   ---  --- Sandy marched back into the room victorious.  I ran to the door of the sitting room only to see Jennifer laid out on the floor out cold, spread eagle and naked.  Before I could think of what to do Sandy tapped me on my shoulder.  I turned around and there Sandy stood.  A little worse for wear.  Trying to catch her breath.  Nude with her torn cat suit draped across her feet. ---  --- "Forget her.  She won't bother us now." ---  --- Sandy brushed the stray hairs out of her face, smiled and stepped out of her nylon costume.  She posed standing and anticipating my admiration.   ---  --- "Now I'm all sweaty and warm.  I need a shower."  Sandy turned her lithe body and walked into the bedroom and into the bathroom beyond. ---  --- I turned around and wondered what I should do for poor Jennifer still laying unconscious on the floor.  Then I heard Sandy calling. ---  --- "Crabby, why don't you come and help me?  You could soap up my......" ---  ---  --- OOPS!!!!  Sorry!!!  Err...just a little fantasy of mine.  I meant to honestly review this movie but my more realistic nature took over.  I swear my pitiful fantasy is actually much better than the story told here.  You see, the cover of this DVD displays Ms. Bullock prominently with her name in big font letters.  But in truth this movie focuses on Tate Donovan as the main character and only on Ms. Bullock as his unlikely love interest. ---  --- As much as I "love" Sandra Bullock, I have to admit her filmography has not been kind to her.  Her best films have been WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING, WRESTLING ERNEST HEMINGWAY and the much-unappreciated HOPE FLOATS.  Unfortunately for each of these gems are several terrible movies like FIRE ON THE AMAZON, HANGMAN, SPEED 2 and this movie. ---  --- The plot revolves around two "losers in love" who are unappealing both in looks and personality.  Donovan comes across a love potion from a gypsy woman (an unrecognizable Anne Bancroft) and soon both Donovan and Bullock have the most desirable members of the opposite sex at their feet.  All goes well until others find out their secret and Donovan and Bullock discover that their true love is actually between each other. ---  --- The story is predictable and unfortunately not very funny or all that sweet.  Chances are you can find a copy of this DVD fairly cheap and it is not a bad way to kill some time while you're waiting for your own boyfriend or girlfriend to get off work-or your friends to wake up from their naps-so you can really do something worth wild.
Not knowing fully what I was getting into, on a whim I purchased this monopod hoping that is was a half-way decent product, I mean-it was so cheap.  I was pleasantly surprised to find how sturdy the unit was and that what I had was a very high quality monopod.  This was my second monopod and so I had another to compare it with (the other was bought on an auction website).  In comparison the Opteka was a far better monopod in height and robust thickness and I use it exclusively on my miniDV shoots
This movie is a wonderful follow up to the first...Anne has the same charming spirit and the cast is just as wonderful as they were the first time. I highly recommend this movie to anyone
I just recently bought the Blackberry Pearl and I love the device. Its stylish, beautiful, small, and it has some awsome features. However, since i bought it from Amazon, Cingular took forever just to approve me and give me a new number. So I constantly had to call amazon and ask them about my order. Then I receive the phone almost a week later than the day I placed my order and as I follow the instructions my phone didn't want to work. So the representatives told me there was something wrong with my SIM card... when it wasn't. Luckily I called Cingular and a very HELPFUL representative helped me set up my account and ACTUALLY the service when Amazon told me there was something wrong with my SIM card LOL. Overall, Amazon should be more careful how they describe their phone activation process because it wasn't easy. But whatever I love shopping @ Amazon and I truly love my phone and I bet you will love it too. :)!!
THE battery is good after a full charge.  It lacks in holding the promised charge.  I find after 2 weeks it is questionable, depending on how many pictures were taken before the camera sat waiting to be used again. I got over 100 pictures when used in 3 days, Which is more that my AA nimh 2100mah. Which I bought from Walmart {so probably not a super battery}  The wallmart batteries actually hold the charge longer {very sad}.The charge time is not to long when charger from half charge. --- Over all, I hope the next ones I buy will be better than these.  My solution is to carry a non rechargeable battery in my case for when the Delkin dies.  I also try to give it a full charge before leaving the house, as there is no memory effect.  I also recomend checking to see if there is a firmware upgrade for your camera.  Every camera shuts off when the battery is at a different power level.  My Nikon coolpix 3100, seems to shut down sooner than later.  All reviews should mention what camera they are using for this reason.  Have been using 3 months now.
I have gone through my latest copy twice of this magazine. The interesting articles and letters make you feel like you are part of a community, not just a crazy cat person. I like the extensive breeder listing in the back, whether or not I ever will get a pure bred cat.
I have been using Cindy Crawfords tapes since 1993. I used shape your body while I was pregnant 10 years ago ( Don't be horrified )  living in the tropics and with a few adjustments I did that workout in the pool minus the situps combined with walking. I had my first birth naturally and within 3 Hours and had the best legs ever. ---  --- My first impression of Cindy was that she is honest. She does not pretend to be the expert and she really has a Genunie interest in exercising this shines throught on the DVDs.  I have tried many other celebrity videos and you just don't feel comfortable with them. She does not try to exercise and be perfect at the same time. Really  she is there just to help and with alot of sympathy.You cannot help but like her. ---  --- New Dimension is fantastic I have started doing the 10min workout everyday. You do not have to do alot to get results just target the right areas. People can workout for an hour and not get the same results. --- New Dimension is not just a post pregnancy DVD . This is great for women over 35 that want to control their pelvic muscles the other two workouts on the DVD are more than you will ever need to work all your body . I still mix it up with first two DVDs --- I have just purchased the set of three DVds again to replace worn out copies . Cindy looks like she will be in my lounge room for a very long time. --- Please enjoy !!!!!!
The phrase "more efficient sourcing" means that Lands End is now buying these in China. The pants arrived with a strange smell (fishy odor), the fit was odd, and, after one washing, the fabric looked bad. They went back ASAP! ---  --- I bought khakis from Lands End for over a dozen years until this recent product change. Notice the past tense. Ownership by K-Mart Holdings is definitely making an impact on the company
I love the workmanship in this piece. Nicely done, and Silver Insanity has Awesome customer service
Have used this lens from the deer stand while hunting, at sporting events (indoor and outdoor) and at concerts.  Fast focusing and great image stabilization (IS does use quite a bit more power, though).  Have not had one problem with it. Solid build and has a little heft to it.  It is a bit pricey, but I chaulk that up to it being about the best on the market.  Would recommend it to anyone looking for a top shelf lens.
This film is boring, so much so that I could only take 35 minutes of it before I was forced to push stop. This is a soap opera about politics & oil companies. It's weird jump around style is confusing & pointless...do yourself a favor and don't bother w/ this garbage
We had a blast making up our on questions and  playing this game. The guys played it and the guys never want to play games
The reception is much better than my old antenna, however, I was expecting instructions to be included with the antenna.  After some time I figured out how to hook up the tv and vcr to the antenna
I love my treadmill!  My son put it together for me and he had no trouble.  I love all the options on this treadmill.  I use only the basic so far, but I can see the benefit in having the pre-programmed workouts.  I can't wait to get there to try it!  ---  --- It's hard to say enough about this machine.  It's a great MACHINE
This coffee is amazing.. we stayed at the Shore Club in Miami Beach and we had some of this coffee with our breakfast at Ago Restaurant.  Hooked ever since, this is the only coffee I ever drink now.  Starbucks, Caribou are nothing compared to this.  One sip or sniff of the aroma, will get you hooked forever.  If you ever make it out to South Beach, ILLY has a store on Ocean Drive
Jack London needs to be given his proper due. He is a tremendously talented writer and his understanding of life matches his tremendous knowledge of the snow-enshrouded world of the upper latitudes. Although The Call of the Wild is a short novel and on the surface a dog's story, it contains as much truth and reality of man's own struggles as that which can be sifted from the life's work of many other respected authors.  ---  --- Jack London's writing is beautiful, poignant, and powerful, yet also somber, morose, and infinitely real. London doesn't paint pretty picture, nor is the story elevating or uplifting. As an animal lover, I found parts of this story heartbreaking from Buck's removal from the civilized Southland in which he reigned supreme among his animal kin to the brutal cold and even more brutal machinations of hard, weathered men who literally beat him and whipped him full of lashes.  ---  --- Even sadder are the stories of the dogs that fill the sled's traces around him. Good-spirited Curly never had a chance, while Dave's story is only made bearable because of his brave, undying spirit. Even Spitz, the harsh taskmaster, has to be pitied, despite his harsh nature, for the reader knows this harsh nature was forced upon him by man and his thirst for riches. Buck's travails are long and hard, but it is his nobility of his spirit that makes of him a hero, despite the primitive animal instincts and urges that dominate him. Buck not only conquers the weather, the harshness of the men, the other dogs and the wolves he comes into contact with, he thrives.  ---  --- Hopes for redemption with John Thornton are dashed in the end, and that's when Buck finally gives in fully to "the call of the wild," becoming a creature of nature only. While this is a sad ending, the reader also feels joy and satisfaction at Buck's refusal to surrender and his ability to find his own kind of happiness in the harsh world in which he is placed
The most untalented producer in the business. Honestly the only tracks that shine is all the ones with Biggie and Black rob's only one hit. The rest of this is trash. Especially those chickenheads Total. And once again Puff tryin to eat off Biggie carcass. Dont give this bum anymore money, Just listen to Biggies two gems and "f" the rest
Sharp set of shoes.  Comfortable, too, and they fit well. ---  --- But I believe they were shipped on Cinderella's Coach - while the mice were still mice.  It took FOREVER to arrive, so be warned
I can truly say that this products doesn't work. I have silky wavy fine hair and I am a hair food junkie so I used a lot of things, but this don't work. Usually anything can tame my hair but all this conditioner do is make it hard, matted, and tangled. Carol Daughter's products may work for some, but it hasn't work for anyone in my family and we all have different hair textures
I suppose it serves a function for people with bad eyesight or something. But......dear GOD that thing is ugly
I enjoy this magazine profusely! It is beautifully stylized,terrific recipes and good for day dreaming too
The watch is super thin; you barely know you are wearing it.  In two weeks, I have had over 10 compliments
This CD is Dave Bromberg's best effort. Playing solo allows his guitar playing capabilities to be clearly demonstrated.
A friend loaned me her CD and I absolutely loved it......but I could not purchase it ANYWHERE.....my daughter suggested I contact you.....results, results!!!! Thank you!  A most outstanding seasonal soft listening CD
First time I've ordered a product from Leg Avenue - and it'll probably be my last!  I opened up the package and the pantyhose already had 4 "runs" in one of the legs before I even tried them on.  What a waste of money...and if I would pay to ship them back for another pair then I've already put way too much money into, what should be, an inexpensive product
I can't stop eating these babie! ---  --- They're good companion for watching a movie at home. ---  --- Don't forget to bring some to the office
This unforgettable story illustrates the crazy, life-changing adventure of a seventeen-year-old boy who struggles to let go of his fading childhood and accept the phoniness of the adult world. Holden Caulfield's loneliness and lack of motivation combined with a traumatic childhood cause him to leave behind his youthful days at Pencey Prep to venture into the dynamic adult world of New York City. Holden tries to hide his youthful innocence as he mirrors the habits of other adults, going to bars, drinking, and purchasing prostitutes. However, his bickering and sarcastic attitude suggest a hidden desire to stay young, a desire he stubbornly buries beneath his new, mature lifestyle. Holden, like many others, longs to live in a place that is simple and motionless, a place where one needn't worry about the past or the future. Holden also hopes to preserve the innocence in others, such as his sister, so they don't turn out like him, depressed and regretful. Through Salinger's vibrant attitude towards Holden's experience in New York, we readers learn to stop running from our past to prevent losing our youth altogether. The Catcher in the Rye has survived generations as one of the world's best bildungsromans, not because it illustrates the fading youth and growing maturity of a memorable character, but because it demonstrates the confusion of a character as he fights desperately to protect what remains of his childhood
The satin finish and the design are very attractive.  I had to pump each chamber about 100 times to get it primed but after that it worked great.  You might want to prime it with water instead of shampoo to get things going.  The directions, which I lost, said something about priming. ---  --- Installation was easy.  It includes both glue or 4 short adhesive strips.  I went with the adhesive strips and it seems secure.  I figured if I ever have to remove it, I could just pull it off and use Goof Off to remove the adhesive. ---  --- If you fill one of the chambers with body soap, I recommend Neutrogena Rainbath Refreshing Shower and Bath Gel, Original Formula and a natural sponge.  I bought a synthetic sponge that looks like a natural one at Wal-Mart and it's a little rough
I knew that this concert DVD was an acoustic show so I wasn't surprised that the tempo was slow at the beginning. But to start the show with Gilmour tuning his guitar was a bit much.  ---  --- Once he did start playing, Gilmour was having such a hard time finding his rhythm that I found myself praying for the drums to kick in.  ---  --- By the time things settle down, the really glaring problem with this DVD comes to the surface. The mix is horrible. The crowd noise drowns out Gilmour at times when they cheer a song they recognize, he is almost inaudible when talking between songs and at many points the backup singers completely cancel him out. I found myself constantly adjusting the volume which really takes away from the "concert experience". ---  --- There are high points in the show, but the low points are rock bottom. Comfortably Numb is a song that millions of people know by heart. Two versions are provided on this DVD - from the concert and in the bonus section. Neither of the guest singers (Robert Hewitt and Sir Bob Geldoff) know the words, have to read from sheet music and based on their phrasing have never heard the song before. Gilmour would have been better off asking for a volunteer from the audience.  ---  --- The very best thing on this DVD is, oddly enough, in the bonus section. Screamin' Jay Hawkins' I Put a Spell on You, a blues standard performed with Mica Paris and Jools Holland, almost makes the DVD worth buying. Almost.  ---  --- Watch Jonathan Demme's beautiful treatment of Neil Young: Heart of Gold if you really want to see a great acoustic show. That is the gold standard.
This philosophy kit really works for people with consistant light to moderate acne. I've tried just about everything out there-prescription topicals & pills, Pro-activ, and all the over the counter stuff. I have adult acne, I never experienced acne as a teenager. When I first started using Philosophy's kit I didn't notice a huge change in the first few weeks, beyond pimples clearing up faster. Around week 5 or 6, I began to notice that I wasn't waking up to a new zit every morning and I didn't feel oily at the end of the day. Now, I have been using for 4 months and feel like a new person. I don't have to cover my face with concealer or retouch make-up throughout the day. I can walk out the door with just powder on my face for the first time in years! I would recommend this kit to anyone who can't use benzoyl peroxide and is frustrated with all the other products on the market
After playing Grand Theft Auto III, I thought there was no way Rockstar could top themselves.  In fact, when the advance word for this game got out, I actually thought this was nothing more than an ADD-ON for GTA3.  Stupid thought, I know; on the whole, GTA:VC is bigger, badder, and more audacious than GTA3 ever was. ---  --- So, here's the story: ---  --- In 1986, Tommy Vercetti -- a hitter for the Forelli crime family in Liberty City -- is finally released from prison.  Sonny Forelli, his boss, immediately sends him down to Vice City to close a major drug deal being handled by Ken Rosenberg, a shyster lawyer and the Forellis' contact.  No sooner is the deal closed than gunmen break it all up, kill everyone but Tommy and Ken, and take both the drugs and the cash.  Now, Tommy has to recover the money for Sonny...but before long, he decides to make a name for himself in this town.   ---  --- The setting is pure '80s excess, through and through.  If you take the bottomless amoral corruption of Scarface, the day-glo polyester fashion of Miami Vice, and the innate cheesy greed of Ronald Reagan's 1980s American culture, you'll have Vice City.  You'll see it in the fashion sense of the citizens, the local architecture, and the cars tooling around on the road.  You'll even hear it in the radio stations, which boast an array of heavy metal, dance, Latino, and bubblegum pop music the like of which you haven't even thought of since the '80s.  I swear; try listening to one of the radio stations and see if the memories don't come flooding back.   ---  --- The voice acting is, as usual, superb.  Ray Liotta did an outstanding job bringing Tommy Vercetti to life, and in making an otherwise loathsome sociopath into a strangely likable character.  And there are others as well; Burt Reynolds, Dennis Hopper, Gary Busey, Lee Majors, Fairuza Balk, and Robert Davi all turn in great performances.  But Philip Michael Thomas, who played Don Johnson's partner Tubbs on Miami Vice, gets special mention; in more ways than one, his character -- Lance Vance -- is the one to keep an eye on. ---  --- While the main story missions only take up a third of the game itself, it's the addition of a new feature that not only rounds things out, it also adds length to the game, and really makes you feel like you're establishing a criminal empire.  They're called asset properties.  At a certain point in the game, you have the option of buying certain businesses.  Once you buy one of these asset properties, and you complete its mission strand, that business will start generating a daily amount of money for you to pick up.  Some of them are perfectly legitimate, such as the taxi company or the nightclub.  Others are a little sketchy, like the boatyard or the strip club, but others are absolutely illegal, like the protection rackets, the "ice cream" company, or the car showroom.  They add a great amount of depth, and they let you establish contacts across town.  Needless to say, once Sonny Forelli comes to town to "check up" on you, make no mistake...he's now in YOUR town. ---  --- So, if you feel the need to get away from it all and indulge your inner Tony Montana, book a trip to Vice City.  Like San Andreas, it's a great place to visit and unwind...and also like San Andreas, you'll be glad YOU don't live there
I've had an old Weber for 15 years - still works well! However, as it was getting too small for my growing needs and starting to show its age, I "upgraded" to this model. --- The new one has more bells and whistles - I do love the smoking burner/box combo. The rest of the features are nice too. However, this thing is almost impossible to get to 500 degrees to sear a steak or do some other high-temp cooking! It runs through a tank of propane in just a couple of serious days of cooking and once you're at less than 3/4 tank, don't bother with high heat - it's not there!  --- On the other hand - very few flare-ups and mid/low temp cooking is great
Amazon.com usually ships this within 24 hours?  It's been over a week, the item is still supposedly in stock, and it still hasn't shipped.  It's a great product, but buy it elsewhere
This is one of the best-tasting energy/snack bars I've tried.  It has true flavors (think a chewy chocolate brownie with small chocolate chips), little or no "off" flavors or aftertastes, and it's relatively filling, especially if accompanied by water or an additional quick snack, such as fruit.  It's a small bar, but it's packed with 3 grams of fiber (12% of daily needs based on a 2,000 calorie diet), and it's certified 95% organic.  These organic ingredients include organic rolled oats, organic oat Flour, organic oat fiber, organic and milled flaxseed, and actual natural flavors.  Even the sweet stuff is organic:, including organic chocolate (made with--you guessed it--organic evaporated cane juice), soy butter, cocoa powder, cocoa butter, tapioca syrup, and fig paste. CLIF's website proclaims that  "CLIF ZBar is the first kids' snack created to comply with SB-19, California's Senate Bill limiting fat and sugar in foods offered within the state's school system...We source ingredients which do not contain wheat and are not genetically engineered."  Although aimed at kids, adults and teens will enjoy this as well.   ---  --- Ingredients: Organic Rolled Oats, Organic Chocolate Chips (Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Organic Unsweetened Chocolate, Organic Cocoa Butter, Soy Lecithin, Natural Flavors), Organic Evaporated Cane Juice Syrup, Organic Brown Rice Syrup, Organic Tapioca Syrup, Organic Fig Paste, Organic Oat Flour, Organic Cocoa Powder, Organic Soy Butter, Natural Flavors, Organic Oat Fiber, Organic Milled Flaxseed, Organic Chocolate (Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Organic Unsweetened Chocolate, Organic Cocoa Butter, Soy Lecithin), Salt, Baking Soda. For those with allegies, CLIF includes the following caution "Contains soy. May contain traces of milk, peanuts and other nuts." ---  --- Vitamins & Minerals: Calcium Carbonate, Ascorbic Acid (Vit. C), Niacinamide (Vit. B3), Ferric Orthophosphate (Iron), Zinc Oxide, Cyanocobalamin (Vit. B12), Thiamine Mononitrate (Vit. B1), Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (Vit. B6), Riboflavin (Vit. B2), Folic Acid (Vit. B9), Beta Carotene (Vit A). ---  --- Nutritional Information: In one bar (36 grams) there are 120 calories, 3 grams of fat (5% of percent daily values based on a 2,000 calorie diet), of which one gram s saturated fat(but no trans fat), 0 cholesterol, 12 grams sugar, A total of 22 grams carbohydrates (7%), which includes 12 grams of sugar and 10 grams of other carbohydrates, 125 mg of sodium (4%), 110 mg. potassium(3%), 3 grams of dietary fiber (12%) and a gram of insoluble fiber, and the following vitamins and minerals:  Vitamin A (6%), B1(30%), B2 (15%), B3 (20%), B6 (20%), B12 (10%), %). C (35%), Iron (10%), zinc (15%), Phosphorus (20%), and Folate (20%). ---  ---  --- I don't think there's a similar product around that can compete with the taste, purity, and nutritional value of this popular new treat
I am very satisfied with the holster for my motorola phone...I would recommend this holster to anyone who needs one for a work phone that is easy to carry and get to when needed..
The string screws are very loose and the strings won't stay tight. Though I know it is only a kid's guitar, it is pretty useless because the strings won't stay on. We bought two and both are the same way. Stay away from this
i like this car seat. it is very soft for a bab
I broke through the toe on the second wearing.  Lousy product
This is not the same model I bought but it looks like it's built the same way.  I bought the InMotion Trampoline by Stamina and it was completely destroyed in under 3 months with regular use.  It didn't have springs but had elastic bands that ripped off.  When I called for warrantey information, I had waited too long, it is only guaranteed for 90 days. ---  --- I'd give it negative stars, but I have to rate it at least 1 star to get the review to show up
Great magazine for families with kids! My son loves all of the activities that can be done! Great price too
Man!  What's the f#$%ing deal with companies handing over their biggest game franchises to second and third party developers???  Haven't they ever heard the old saying, "Dance with the one that brought you???" ---  --- This game is horrible, and if you say otherwise you're in bad need of therapy because you're so desperate for a video game that you've convinced yourself this is worthy of your time. ---  --- Or maybe your time is truly that worthless...in which case you should contemplate drastic measures. ---  --- First off, the game is VERY linear.  "Call of Duty 2" truly felt like an open battlefield, whereas this one feels like a ride at Disneyland.  Sure the scenery is beefed up and beautiful, but how about those character animations?  The mouths aren't synched to the dialogue, and they do that mindless hand-waving thing when they talk...just like all cinematics did back on the PS1 and N64.   ---  --- The AI is horrible.  In Call of Duty 2 you couldn't just hold your crosshairs in the same spot and wait for the idiot German to pop up in the same place so you could plug him.  In this one you CAN---but you just don't care to.   ---  --- Also---"IT'S GLITCHERIFFIC!"  I shot a German and he flew straight up into the air, completely off the top of the screen!  I snuck up behind another German and hit him with a melee attack----the friggin' dude did two front flips and flew like twenty yards.  Mind you, he was in the standing position the entire time.  Not unlike tossing an action figure across the yard. ---  --- This game left a stale taste in my mouth, and really just pissed me off.  Call of Duty 2 was 360's only killer app.  If nothing else these people need to realize that once you have a great game---all we really want as gamers is a great big expansion pack!  They could've added 12 more hours of additional content to Call of Duty 2's campaign missions and I would've paid $60, cash on the barrelhead son.   ---  --- Way to go jacka@@es. ..
The tin makes the world of difference. I purchased the large tin and have been using it for over 7 months. The spice still smells extremely fresh
I was very excited about this product, given the good reviews. However, I found that refilling the pencil took so much force that I was afraid I'd break it. Even worse, the eraser is useless, due both to the design and the material. If I could find a replacement eraser that was taller & better, this would be a much better product. If I have to carry this plus a separate eraser, it's not really saving me much. ---  --- Oh, and the highlighter isn't a marker. Maybe I'm stupid, but I assumed it would be. It's just an orange ink pen, which is not the same as any other highlighter I'd choose to use
Being an Oriental I am fairly familiar with films released by our geographical neighbours, although not as extensive as standard Hollywood productions. With Japanese films, whether it was made by a Kurusawa or a  more obscure artisan, I can fairly adjudged them on a whole as lethargic in  pace, inconspicuously lacks background music/instrumentals, and are  generally pressed on celluluid films that are simply comparatively  substandard.  Village of Dreams, while touted as an award winner  is a  glaring testimony of this stunted Japanese film-making characteristic.  Review it yourself. The pace alone wantingly needs tighter editing. It was  the same character that can be seen even in Kurusawa's Ran - a "highly  acclaimed" work that in my case, I couldn't even view for the third  time, because even its DVD resolution has a quality that can only be  likened to the eye-view of a person who's suffering his earliest stage of  creeping glaucoma.  Village of Dreams is so "relaxed" as if the  filmmaker expects people like me to have an available time that they  enjoyed in 1940s Japan in an obscure countryside. At the very least, the  straight narrative of this film is a consolation, but with RAN, the actions  were so hard to follow, you'd be puzzled who was fighting and attacking  whom.  The most unforgivable quality of this DVD transfer  is the poor film  stock. The picture approximates that of a "third generation"  recording of a VHS copy. This means that you'll be sorely dissapointed of  having to get a VHS-quality copy COPIED, in turn, from another VHS copy  which was copied from the original VHS "master tape".  Of course,  the DVD transfer is not at fault, its simply that the Japanese despite  their touted techno prowess just couldn't give us a decent film stock, that  could at least preserve their comparatively well-made gems. The glaring  deficiency of films like this comes even more obvious, when shown on high  resolution TVs. I've viewed this film in a 29-inch Sony Wega Flat TV, and  in a 50-inch Mitsubishi projection TV, from a Pioneer DVL 919 and 909. If  not for the antics of the two children leads, Village comes off as  wearisome. I bought this film despite its hefty price tag mainly because  I'm a film collector. Its works like this that whets my appreciation for  world cinema. Unfortunately, Village's poor resolution takes away  gratifying cinematic enjoyment, as well  as negating its  "collectability" factor. This should have looked more glorious if  it could approximate the celluluid quality of examples like  What Dreams  May Come or Dark City, but of course that's asking too much from those  editing-challenged Japanese filmakers.  I want to ask Amazon for a refund  because this is not well worth its price value. I was compulsed to buy it  because of its cover, I thought it was at least as exotically  glorious-looking as KUNDUN, but it proved to be just a small, obscure  production. Critics may raved about it, just like those Canadians did with  BLACK ROBE, but the final word is that they're just run of the mill, albeit  thoughtful, films....
I ordered and paid in full (through Amazon) for a gift subscription to Vogue Kitting last Christmas, 2005. The recipient never received a single issue and was treated very poorly when she phoned to inquire on more than on occasion.  ---  --- It is a quarterly publication but no longer seems to be consistently offered on news stands in major bookstores. Read the policy regarding refunds and cancellations carefully before you give them your money! ---  --- The content of the magazine may be worthwhile but their inability to deliver as promised and poor customer service earn them one star
FINALLY - a way to buy just the Lego bricks to build using your imagination.  I only have one, but no more "kits" for me!!  Even the Lego company on line doesn't have this one!  Highly recommended
We have the 49MHz Whisper Connect and love it (see our review of that one). We needed a second monitor to replace a 900MHz Fisher Price monitor that is 4+ years old, and decided to try this one out. We set the base across the room from our daughter and had her talk at her normal voice, and we could barely hear here with the volume turned up. We thought we must have a defective unit, so we returned it and got another, and we had the same problem. There is no interference or static with the monitor - but also no sound. We're very unhappy with it and would not recommend it
Upon receiving this planter, I was quite surprised at the quality of it for the bargain price. Having no yard, but a heavily planted balcony, I do a lot of container gardening and have purchased many pots, planters and window boxes of various sizes and shapes at local stores. One thing that especially shocked me was the fact that the tray was included at the low price. It surely deserves the "PPP"! Thanks a lot for the pot
These are wonderful sandals. Tried to find flat slingback sandals in the stores but to no avail. Finally did the right thing and went online. Great Sandals at a very reasonable price. You won't be sorry if you purchase these. Very stylish and very comfortable
Our son got these blocks when he was 2 months old.  My husband enjoyed them more at first, but by the time our son was 5 months old he loved playing with these!  He probably couldn't hold on to them well until he was 5 months old, so that is why he enjoyed them more at this age than earlier. ---  --- At 10 months, he still enjoys playing with them.  They have lasted through "both" children.  I would highly recommend these blocks for infants, and so far even into the toddler age, he enjoys playing with them
im really sorry about my review below. my friend did it without me knowing off my accout. im really sorry
This product is great. Its much easier to get in Canada that's why I ordered it online since I am now living in the US.  However after the fact - I did find it available at Cost Plus World Market.  Next time I will pay attention to the volume of the product. The picture is not the right one. This Double size is really waay to much for my use.  I think I now have a lifetime supply.   --- Using custard powder is way better in homemade nanaimo bars than using vanilla pudding mixes.
slippers finally arrived and i was a little bit dissapointed. construction was cheap, goose fill was light and overall flimsy. if you want to wear it twice, then thats what its worth
I couldn't agree more about this product. It's appalling how badly made it is. The concept is very cute - a toolbox that unfolds into bridges and roads for the small die-cast vehicles. My 2.5 year-old has a hard enough time dealing with frustration without this toy adding to it! The bridge on the right doesn't properly attach or stay up and the road pieces do not attach properly. It's also a battle to get the tool box to connect together. My son always wants to play with it, but I can't cope with his cries of frustration when it all falls apart. I think this toy will have to mysteriously "disappear" one night while he is sleeping. They should withdraw this rubbish from the market and refund us all our money!
No, this gun isn't very powerful - but THAT'S THE POINT. This gun is perfect for a young kid to learn about guns.  Slow enough you can actually see the BB, accurate enough to hit a target routinely at around 20 to 25 feet
I ordered this bracelet as a Christmas gift for my best friend.  Based on the reviews, it seemed to be a really nice product at a decent price.  However, upon receipt of the bracelet, I was so disappointed in its quality that I felt the need to purchase another gift to give along with the bracelet
Sidney Bechet was one of the first real fathers of jazz. Burns puts together a great combination of early recordings. Jazz historions note Bechet as one of the only horn players that could keep up with Louis Armstrong. You have to include Bechet in your Jazz collection, and this one is as good as any
I really look forward to receiving this every month.  I am blown away by all their crafty ideas for art projects, organization, and meals.  Really fun
This accessory system does not fit my Kohlcraft umbrella stroller.  I can find a place to put the parent cupholder, but there is no place at all to put the child's snack tray.  The stroller will not close when it is attached anywhere on the stroller.  The whole purpose of spending the money on this "system"  (which was considerably more expensive than others in the store) was for my child to have a snack tray.  Therefore, it's going back to the store.  There are plenty of other cup accessories out there that are far cheaper than this... even the Prince Lionheart cupholder alone was very expensive...  ---  --- The product itself is also very cheaply made.  The "s" hooks look so flimsy I wouldn't trust them... again, they sell thicker, sturdier "s" hooks that look like they will work much better than this, so that's what I'll purchase.  Plus, the parent cupholder is also extremely flimsy... already the "arms" have fallen off several times and that was just moving it from the table to the kitchen counter!     ---  --- Thirdly, I'm not sure if it was the "clips" that came in my packet (perhaps a defect) or if they are all made this way... but it is extremely difficult to get the screws into the clips... and then they didn't fasten correctly.  No matter how I tried (I worked on it for close to an hour and I consider myself pretty good at these things!), I could not get the clips to tighten properly.  They continued to be loose... even with using the smaller screws.  Perhaps my stroller tubing is "too small"??? Very unlikely, but it just might be the case.   ---  --- This is going back to the store, where I will purchase the insulated parent cupholder for $5, a package of two (thick) "s" hooks for $3 and my child will have to learn to "deal" with holding her snack cup and straw cup.  I will save myself $10, a headache and backache from attempting to continue to get this on correctly, and my child will get the added bonus of learning to be responsible for her own items!!!  Do yourself a favor and don't bother with this product!!!
Movie got 2/3 through and just quit. No problem, this is Windows right? Just reboot and start where you left off. Only for whatever reason I can't restart this movie from anywhere but the beginning. I'm not going to watch this moving over from the beginning just to see if it fails in the same place again. Only a couple bucks, but definitely not worth it
I must agree with some other reviewers of this book, and say that it is a very dry list of factual data, interspersed with Bill Wyman's moans and boasts. His gripe with Allan Klein about money seems to be quite valid, but he mentions it about a thousand times. Mick and Keith get quite a pasting- again it seems quite valid, but do we need to hear it so many times?    Bill opines that Keith Richard's voice is weak and that his own songs were ignored by the band. Listen to his only self-penned Stones track of the 60s, on "Satanic Majesties", and you will conclude that this is quite a self delusion- his voice is far weaker, and his songwriting at that time was also inferior.     The book seems to be more authoritative on dates, but we can only take Bill's accuracy on faith. My knowledge of the Stones is not enormous, but even I can see some big factual errors. For example he tells us that neither Taj Mahal nor Marianne Faithfull recorded songs for the "Rock n Roll Circus". A recent re-issue has proved him completely wrong.      As another reviewer rightly said, Marianne Faithfull's autobiog is a much better read
This software is very hard to use. The help video goes too fast, the manual doesn't cover everything and nothing is intuitive. I have used a lot of software and this is just not worth the money
I used Lexar Media Multi Card REader in my P2120 Fujitsu laptop via a USB 2 PC-Card adapter.  It's truly plug-and-play without any need of drivers in Windows XP
This is one of the great biopic films ever made.  More often than not, film biopics are too rushed.  They try and squeeze in every aspect of their subjects lives, and they end up giving short shrift to the person and their lives.  This is not one of those films.  It just covers Woody Guthrie's adult life, from when he hit the road to when he became a big time folk singer, and his passionate defense of the working man.  The look of the film is deliberate, in that it's washed out.  The hoedown scenes at the camp are some of the best in the film.  They're really lively, where the extras and everyone seem to be really enjoying themselves.  The film has a real genuine feel to it, like you're actually watching real people.  David Carradine is amazing as Woody Guthrie.  He makes you think you're actually watching Woody himself.  He did his own singing and stuntwork on the film.  Ronny Cox is excellent as well, and he does his own singing too (remember, Cox played the man who jammed with the hillbilly in Deliverance).  Randy Quaid and Melinda Dillon offer great supporting roles as well.  This is a fabulous film, and it feels short at 2 1/2 hours.      
I got this video thinking it would be like the baby faith videos with fun and creative elements for learning development. My baby watched about two mintues and was gone. I think this is pitched as a baby video but it's really more geared toward older children. None of the elements have anything to do with the music, making is virtually useless as a learning development product. I give it a big "thumbs down". Try any one of the baby faith products like God Made Me, God Made Music and God Made Animals. They're awesome!
Have only used the smaller chicken base.  Chicken came out great.  Easy to fill cooker with whatever savory concoction one likes.  Imparts nice flavor and moistness to the birds.  Easy to clean.  Should not have to pay for two Turkey cookers to get two Chicken cookers, though. 
The only misstep so far in a wonderful series.  I was so eager for the book, I got a copy of the British edition, before it got to the US.  But I was disappointed.  Somehow this just just doesn't get off the ground.  Could Davis be tiring of Falco?  It seems to me that she is.  Maybe it's time to DO something, Lindsey!  Make some real changes in tbe characters' situations or kill them off.  Real dullness in the supporting cast and plot, and the main characters (besides Falso, who always has a life of his own) pall
Yes, Ben Witherington is a (relative) conservative, but don't hold that against him. Yes, he has strong opinions, but don't hold that against him, either, because they are well argued. The fact remains that this is the best overview of "Third Quest" Jesus scholarship I have been able to find. Admirers of the Jesus Seminar may not appreciate his critique, but it is very fair and well-thought out. One of the benefits from a book like this, besides giving interested parties a launching pad for further research, is that the different views of Jesus can help one achieve a well-rounded portrait of the Savior. No one scholar gets it right all the time (not even Witherington, with his own view of Jesus as God's wisdom), but the different insights are valuable, because Jesus is bigger than what any one person can comprehend. That should be a cause for humility (something some Jesus scholars have lacked, at least in print). I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in contemporary Jesus scholarship
I was looking for something portable and to keep the baby close by.  I tried it out with a baby doll first and I ended up covering the Snuggle Nest with my blankets in the middle of the night. 
I've used several types of cervical cold packs over the past few years, both at home and also professional cold packs at chiropractic appointments to help decrease muscle inflammation, and this is by far the best because of its super flexible fabric immediately from the freezer and its ability to stay cold for a longer time if needed
but the stitching was irregular on the front. I thought the company produced good products, but I was mistaken when I bought this item. Next time I'll just go to BestBuy for a camera case
     The bench is easy to assemble, and lid actually --- does work well.  It is not an item that will last --- forever, but it is priced fairly for what it is--a storage --- bench. 
Really dry and just not as good as could be. A disappointment after using this companys other products
I read the mixed reviews on this site before purchasing, so it's my own fault for still going ahead and purchasing!  I was hopeful the product would work for me. ---  --- I've tried 3 of these in different locations in my yard, all with the same result:  mounds of dirt leading right up to the Molechaser!  They seem attracted to it, not turned off by it.  I only wish I could upload a photo of the dirt mounds that literally are less than an inch away from each device! ---  --- This product has done nothing to discourage moles, voles, etc.  In all three locations, the lawn damage continues. ---  --- Don't make the same mistake I did.  Look for another solution rather than this product
Like you (I'm sure) I saw this machine on television (mistake number one) and then ordered it online without ever trying it first. This machine is a joke. If you cannot get your legs over your head then MAYBE this machine is for you. But this is NOT for serious users who stretch everyday. I can do more with my $5 stretch band from Target than I can with this big heavy space-taking piece of junk. The resistance is zero, and just laughable over all. Save yourself the money, and frustration - buy a lightweight no-hassle stretch band!
This concept is very interesting and new fangled (at least to me) as far as plush animals.  The interactive/internet/game aspect is very clever and provides a lot of fun for kiddos.  I got this for my nephew and he likes it.  It keeps him entertained.  One thing--they just don't make stuffed animals the way they used to as far as quality.  Justin is not rough with his toys, and this hippo has already lost some of his hair.  I wish we could find good quality plush anymore.  I hate the idea of disposable toys because I grew up with tonka toys and teddybears that I still have.  I still have my Raggedy Ann and Andy dolls from about twenty-five years ago, and they have never lost hair.  So buy the hippo for fun, but don't expect him to survive
don't buy this sheet!!  it is not much thicker than a piece of tissue paper!  spit up would go right through it. ---  --- i have a much better solution for you--buy a couple of sheet savers to use in your pack-n-play.  they are a couple of $$ less and are sold as "especially for baby"(which is B-R-US house brand).  they are great.  i use them for both my son's crib and for the pack n play. they come in a number of colors so you should be able to match them to just about any pattern
I thought I'd be nice in giving film two stars even though it pretty much deserves none at all. I wasn't old enough at the time, but I'm sure fans were slightly bemused at the re-emergence of Friday the 13th.  Tommy, now a teenager (and a bloody old one at that) is residing at the local mental institution still traumatised by the terror of Jason and also the death of his mother.  Tommy is plagued by dreams and nightmares convinced that Jason is back from the dead.  And it seems he may be right, when a series of murders begins. But who could it possibly be THIS time. Jason is dead, isn't he? --- It's up to Tommy to fight his demons once again and get to the bottom of things before he himself becomes the victim of Jason Voorhees? --- Friday the 13th Part 5 is a perfect example of how sequels in horror can ruin what went before.  The body count in this is ridiculously high and the gore itself leaves a lot to be desired.  Was it really necessary? Is too much, too much? --- The only ounce of credibility in this film is Harry Manfredini's reprisal musical score.  Other than that, you'd be forgiven for skipping this Friday the 13th entry
The idea behind this toy is great & ours has lived up to its durability claim.  My husband did not complain about adding songs to it, so it could not have been too bad.  Batteries:  this eats through them like crazy - and we used Duracell.  Volume:  the idea of volume control is good, but the highest volume is way too low.  I can't even hear anything until I get it to the mid-setting.  My 5 yr old son takes his to wrestling matches to listen while he waits his turn, but the background noise of the gym drowns out the sound in his headphones.  We probably should not have bought this until next year, maybe Fisher Price will have improved it by then
Every listen I get more into this CD. Many catchy songs. I now need to buy more of Donald's solo stuff. Great music
Just received the flex skin and my first thought is that this is way over priced.  This is a $5.00 piece of soft plastic that will do very little to protect the unit.  It will protect against scratching, but only the areas of the unit you're not really concerned about.  The screen is totally exposed, so it can be scratched when in the unit.  I'm sure that's so you can see the screen better, but a clear protective cover (that can open and close) over the screen would have been nice.  Anyway, at $25.00 this is too much to spend.  I'm ordering a leather cover with a kick stand (which by the way you need if you want to stand it up on your desk or on a table) for less than the price of this product.  I feel I just flushed $25.00 bucks down the drain, hopefully you will not. 
These headphones are comfortable, simple, durable, and give some the the best playback I've heard. I have done a fair amount of studio work, and although you can get better headphones, they'll cost four or five times as much
I bought this mic in December and after only two nights of singing, it completely died!  What a complete disappointment.  Save your money! 
The Firms "Super Body Sculpt" is a 40 mins, 3 parts workout which is broken up into Upper Body, Lower Body, and Abs.  Each segment has its own warmup and cool down. It can be performed one segment at a time, or all together for a complete total body workout.  The Upper Body flies by quickly with pushups, lat rows and french presses and biceps.  The Lower Body section focuses a little too much on Squats, and by the end of your last leg press exercise, there are more squats  that will make you want to scream "Enough".  I found the Abs section too short and not enough emphasis on crunches, and too much on obliques.  The stablization exercises are a great bonus to this DVD, and are my favourite.  Overall it is very well instructed.  You can pyramid up the weights if you are strong enough, especcially during leg presses and squats.  I usually do all three segments to get the full benefits I need, and this DVD is great as a beginners tool to a firm body
This is by far the best movie that I have seen that portrays the real life of a Gypsy. Though it is not a documentary, but you will learn a lot about the Gypsy way of life, their music, and most of all FLAMENCO in a very beautiful and touching story.  ---  --- Your breath will be taken away from the very first scene. Awesome sights and awesome music. What can I say! Tomatito performs one of his most beautiful heart-felt solo accompanied with a group of Arabic Musicians. This heavenly moment alone is the reason what makes life so beautiful and precious.
This film has great color production and performance.  The price is also just right.  You can't go wrong with the Fujifilm Superia X-TRA 400
Many years ago, an acquaintance of mine was the property manager of a low-rent motel.  One morning, while he was in the back office behind the front desk, two men jumped over the counter and started beating on the door.  He could see them, but they could not see him through the privacy security glass.  The men continued to beat on the door, trying to get in.  He waited inside patiently, with his Glock pistol.  As soon as the door fell and the men ran inside, he shot them both.  They turned out to be high school teenagers who were trying to break in to obtain crack money.  I recalled that many in the community dissaproved of his actions.  It turned out that he had plenty of time to leave through the back door and call for help.  When asked why he had to kill them, he simply said, "I own the life of anyone who threatens my personal safety.  I did it because it was my right and I could."  Fortunately, it was considered self-defense. ---  --- I remembered that he always carried a short stick, attached to his keys.  It was not until many years later that I finally figured out what that little wooden stick was.  I became interested in self-defense and decided to buy a baton for myself. ---  --- This was my first Kubaton.  I was concerned because this one has a pointed end.  The pointed end, although not sharp compared to a blade weapon, will easily punch a hole through four layers of very heavy cordura cloth with little effort on my part.  I was afraid that if ever I had to use it, the amount of damage it will cause and its design would make it hard for me to claim that I was acting in self-defense.  I bought another Kubaton, from the same manufacturer, with a flat end.  The replacement baton is exactly like this one, except the end is flat.   ---  --- I tested the replacement and it will also punch a hole through heavy canvas.  But it takes a lot more force to do so.  More importantly, to the average person, it looks less aggressive than this one.  If I had to use it in self-defense, a presiding judge or jury might be less likely to think of it as a weapon. ---  --- If you are not concerned about perception, then get this pointed baton.  If it can easily punch a hole through layers of cordura cloth (the same material used in heavy duty outdoor bags, outerwear, and hiking shoes), it can easily injure an attacker who might be wearing several layers of clothes.  But please understand that some might put this in the same category as they would a knife.  That might make it difficult to claim self-defense, in the event that you have to use it to protect yourself.   ---  --- My old acquaintance was well-versed and knowledgeable.  He not only knew how to use his weapons, but he also understood where the line is between self-defense and assault.  He knew just the limits of what he could get away it in the use of deadly force to defend himself.  This pointed baton, made out of hardened aluminum alloy, is probably for such a person. ---  --- MY FRIEND'S TIP: ---  --- Here's a tip from that old acquaintance of mine.  The keys themselves are a part of the weapon.  And you can make them more effective, which will increase the damage from the baton.  Take some keys that you no longer use.  Any metal key would do, but try to find different sizes.  About four of them would do.  Take the keys to a grinder (even a rasp will do) and sharpen the teeth of each key.  Now, put the four keys in the keyring along with your regular keys.  Face the sharp keys in opposite directions.  Meaning two should face one way, but the other two should face in the opposite direction.  The idea is that when you swing the baton like a flail, the sharpened keys would cut into the attacker's flesh.  The keys are faced in opposite directions so that you can do major damage regardless of which direction that you are swinging.   ---  --- CITAN'S EXPERIMENT:  ---  --- Please keep in mind that you can also cut your hand.  I tried this technique.  I wore a pair of leather work gloves and swung against a wooden post.  The sharpened keys bounced back and hit the back of my hand.  Without the gloves, my hand would have gotten badly cut.  For what it's worth, I swung against a large watermelon and the keys didn't bounce back though.  I don't have anything else to add here, except maybe it might be good to swing against an attacker's fleshy parts to prevent the keys from rebounding.  I'm not an expert though.  But it was fun trying it on a watermelon
I loved What The Bleep? And I specifically wanted to learn more about 'creating your day'. ---  --- This video teaches NOTHING about how to create your day - NOTHING. ---  --- It's just Ramtha (JZ Knight) talking about the fact that you can create your day.  I HEARD YOU IN THE MOVIE!  I bought this to give me some additional insights into HOW to create my day. ---  --- It does NOT teach any HOW whatsoever. ---  --- DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO! ---  --- Buy "The Secret" @ TheSecret.tv. ---  --- Buy "The Attractor Factor" by Joe Vitale. ---  --- Buy "Wealth Beyond Reason" by Bob Doyle. ---  --- DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO
Not easy for any beginner to use. Unless you knew exactly what kind of silver you were trying to identify i.e. English, Scottish, Irish... etc, it was a bit confusing. Marks are black & white, some not showing very good clarity and everything is in extremely in small print. If you just want to sort through tons of marks and dates, this may be for you. If you want information about your piece, pass it up
As a social work psychotherapist, I recommend this book highly and with great confidence. I have a number of people I see individually or via phone consultation and have recommended they purchase this book as adjunct to the work we do together. Peter understands and explains well the relationship between our emotional attachments and the "thhings" we collect. Great insight and recommended
Who would ever wear this monstracity? First of all you got no color, no padding, no pazazz! This shirt makes the garbage bag I wear look like a royal tunic. It is also from a company called Jerzees and it's not a jersey? What up with that? Michael Jordan is probably spinning in his grave
John Waters is a very brilliant and odd film director. he brings camp, trash, filth, humor and morality to all of his movies, pushes peoples buttons, goes farther than most dare (and then some) isnt afraid of being censored and does what he does and to me thats brillance. true alot of people will think his work is tasteless stupid and gross but thats the whole point! lol! people who dont have a sense of humor or who are not open minded will not like his movies. these are not for right wing conservatives but they should see them (especially a Dirty shame) to broaden their minds a little more. my personal favorites are Pink Flamingos, A dirty Shame, Female Trouble, Polyester and Desperate Living. Serial mom is also a fav but not in this collection. He has come from underground trash to Queen of filth,trash and crudeness and for not being afraid of being bold, outlandish, outspoken and bizzar, I applaud you John Waters. Brillant
The title says it all: one month the warranty expired, the zoom feature on the camera broke, making a horrible grinding noise if you attempted to turn it on.  The camera is all but useless.  The Fuji shop said they need to replace the lens assembly, at a cost of at least US$120; for that price, I'm buying a new camera, but not another F10. --- 
The Snuzzler works well for our small baby in his Graco Metrolite stroller.  It supports his head well and he seems very comfortable sitting on it. 
After wearing the Betula Birkenstocks for about an hour, the snap button kept coming undone near the buckle.  Happened pretty much every 10 minutes when i walked.  Midwest wont take them back since i wore them.
This polo is absolutely fabulous! I love the length, it comes down to my hips. I bought it in the size I usually wear and it fits great! I wore it under a little khaki jacket with jeans and it looked fantastic. I can't wait to buy it in every color
 ---   This is another "Rip-Off" CD. 3 songs and a Video, don't make this a good purchase. ---  ---   I expect a CD to have, at least, 8-10 songs on it. ---  ---  
Well I got these headphones and connected them and realized when it played the front center channel i only got sound from the front left speaker. Then the rear right channel didn't work at all. After calling tigerdirect to see about a refund. The first customer service rep was Rude and unwilling to help. Said we had to ship it back to them in the orginal big brown UPS box with all the extra millions of packing peanuts. After getting the management on the phone they were more willing to help but its not enough.  The headphones feel cheap and the wires are not color coded like everyone else uses. the instructions are lacking and the speakers that did work in them didn't sound that good at all
This is a brilliant film by a master filmmaker/storyteller.  Dark, moody, exciting (and FAST!), THX-1138 is an amazing example of style AND substance.  So whatever you do, DON'T BUY THIS DVD! ---  --- Instead, spend just a few bucks more and get the 2 DVD version which delves into the making of the film, the early days of Lucas and Coppola, Walter Murch's involvement, and the whole story about American Zoetrope.  It also has a little segment made back in the day about the actor's getting their heads shaved.  All in all, it is a spectacular DVD set and worth the extra few dollars.  (The 2 dvd version also has a much better cover.
For the price, this product should receive the Cruciatus Curse ad infinitum. The material is all synthetic (I was expecting a wool blend, though the ad said nothing about what the hat and scarf were made of), the relatively loose weave means it will not last as long, and one of the tassels fell off the scarf after just one wearing. I dislike being taken advantage of just so I can make my daughter happy. She is disappointed as well. It was a lot of money to pay to get the Hogwarts crest on a patch that wasn't even fully embroidered. J.K. Rowling should be upset that English Woolens, with which this product will be associated by people who are not in the know, will acquire such a poor image because of the greed of the licensing people
This recording is not great company.  I'm really confused: is it a Broadway recording or a very poor amatuer recording?  And if so, did this rubbish actually make it to the Broadway stage?  I feel for the people that saw it, and were expecting the rich full melodies that Sondheim produced for this show.  The Musical Director for this abomination should be called a Mutilation Director, because that is precisely what he did to the music of this show.  So the only advice I give to future Musical Directors that want to revive and revamp a show: If it's not broke, please, please, please don't try and fix it!  Some things are just perfect the way they are.  Don't buy this CD.  I did and it is now a coaster where it gets better use
Purchased five of these sets thinking they would be fun stocking stuffers.  Wanting to check out what I purchased, I opened one of the five.   The geodes are tiny (not as pictured).  It was like breaking open dirt-clods... that have a small empty space inside... but not crystals.  Maybe it was a "dud" box, but will probably be returning the other four.
My son loves music and really likes Dan Zanes.  We started with the videos on Disney and the "catch that train" song really got us singing, so we ordered this CD.  Now my son sings along with it, dances and jumps around.  Dan Zanes really is fun for the family
This is a must for car tent camping. The main burner will boil 2 qts of water in about 5 minutes. Large enough to cook a complete meal small enough to be easy to pack
This is one of those products that is good in theory but not in practice.  I thought, "OOh what a nifty idea, a head bumper!" The whole idea was great; BUT if your baby is a wiggle worm like mine, then the head bumper guard is a waste.  I actually found this item to be more of a hazard than anything.  Because my son wiggles while he sleeps he ended up with his arm stuck under the side guards wrapped in a semicircle around the bumpers.  Don't ask me how he did this.  The good thing was that if he wet through his diaper the pad underneath absorbed the urine.  Other than that it was a hassle to keep in the crib
I am impressed with this product. All the parts were clearly marked. All the parts were included in the box. The directions were excellent. No complaints here
It is difficult not to break them when first trying to open them.  On the flip side once they have been opened once, they don't reclose very well
I purchased this camera for my 6 yr old daughter. It isn't even good enough for a child's toy camera!  --- She had asked for a camera with a flash and screen for viewing what she had taken photos of. This camera looked like it would fit the bill. It was small and "cool" looking, had a dock (great idea), Li-ion battery (great idea) and a skin (great idea.) Unfortunately it lacks the ability to take decent photos in varied environments (We are not always outside in the sun!) If they would put a better camera in the same package it would become very desirable. --- Save yourself the grief and buy something else. I'm getting a 5MP HP (for less money even!
A Man Escaped is one of those films that improves with repeat viewings. Bresson makes a strange choice in omitting the opening chapter of the memoir the film is based on which deals with the hero's curiously distant emotional response to killing a collaborator, which does throw some light on the sudden apathy and inertia that paralyses him once he is on the brink of making his much-delayed escape, but in other respects it's a perfectly contained and executed movie.  ---  --- The performances are very strong (Bresson was still aiming for naturalistic performances at this time) and the Christian allegory - that we want redemption but instinctively back away from it - is not overstrained: although this time round I noticed a few more references to religion than I recalled, it's there if you want to see it but never at the cost of turning the movie into a sermon. ---  --- New Yorker's source material is not especially good, but considering how bad most 35mm prints that go round the revival circuit are, it may well be a case of making the best of what material was available to them
I thank the creators of this film which took me back to the days of growing up in Detroit.  All the time time I was learning every new Motown song and every new dance step to go with the newest hits, I had no knowledge of the Funk Brothers. I grew up on Detroit's "North End" and a lot of the Motown stars came from this area. I connected to the film immediately when it opened to snow-covered English tudor homes on Detroit's Northwest side. The film has wonderful themes: fame, success, heartbreak, the beauty of friendship among musicians, failure to be recognized, recognition much too late, and attempts of redemption, if not apology. I think the whole city of Detroit, or at least my part of it, was heartbroken with the news that Motown was moving to Los Angeles. In the film the musicians are given their due, a la their Cubano brothers and sisters in "Buena Vista Social Club.
This was the break through record for Pink Floyd that would place them in the super-league. The strength of the record lies in the song writing that is simple yet engaging and Dave Gilmore's guitar playing and voice is superb. Production wise this is well polished and the presence of the sax and backing vocalists just give it that little extra commercial potential. Overall the record works well as a whole yet I do feel 'Money' seems out of place. The problem with records like this that it is too easy to enjoy and all the sharp ends are neatly filed off and well packaged for your consumption. --- Now don't get me wrong I think this is a magnificent record but is it really Pink Floyd's greatest album, I tend to think not. Is it the greatest record of all time? Most certainly not. Because a records sells 35 million copies does not make it automatically great. Because everybody and their grandmother thinks it's great, does not necessarily make it great. The problem with this record is that it sounds of its time, not that that's a bad thing, its just that it does not transcend time. The real indication of a great record is how many people it inspires to make records that sound like it. I can't think of many records that sound like this without sounding retrogressive. Some records released at the same time: Can's "Future Days"(1973); Nue!'s "2"(1973); King Crimson's "Larks' Tongues In Aspic"(1973); Robert Wyatt's "Rock Bottom"(1974); Tangerine Dream's "Phaedra"(1974) are by far more influential and enduring than Dark Side. If you don't own Dark Side then buy it because it is a very good record and deserves its five stars, but make sure you buy 'Piper at the Gates of Dawn' also. 'Piper' is Floyds greatest, most influential and definitely one of the greatest of all time. Besides, how many people who think 'Dark Side' is Floyd's best have actually heard 'Piper'.
Dragons are certainly among the most quintessential elements of the fantasy genre and their likenesses comprise one of the cornerstones of the art associated with it. DragonArt: How to Draw Fantastic Dragons and Fantasy Creatures is both an enjoyable browse and a useful guide for anyone interested in creating their own dragons or other fantastic creatures with pencil and paper.  ---  --- DragonArt is divided into three major parts, Fantastic Dragons, Unique Details, and Other Fantasy Creatures, along with an introduction, a section on how to use the book, and a brief guide to fantastic creatures.  ---  --- Lessons in this book are progressive in nature, beginning with fundamentals and moving into increasingly advanced aspects of dragon design, all illustrated with step-by-step illustrations that are punctuated by helpful tips and tricks throughout. And author/artist Jessica "NeonDragon" Peffer has a clear, easy writing style that can be easily comprehended, absorbed, and acted upon, an example of which follows below.  ---  --- "Okay, so we're going to discuss the anatomy of a creature that exists nowhere but in our minds. Sounds kind of silly to say that something made from pure imagination does not look correct, but that will happen if your creature doesn't look believable. To help make your dragon as real as possible, base its structure on real creatures," she writes at one point (page 44). "The ideal dragon is likely a mix of cat, bird, and reptile body types. The trick is choosing which parts to keep and which ones to throw out. You want it to feel like a single creature."  ---  --- This advice, incidentally, is very reminiscent of that given by Leonardo Da Vinci in his notebooks for drawing creatures of this ilk, making Peffer well read or naturally very insightful, either of which speaks well for her. Under "How You Should Make an Imaginary Animal Look Natural," the increasingly famous Renaissance man writes, "You know that you cannot invent animals without limbs, each of which, in itself, must resemble those of some other animal. Hence if you wish to make an animal, imagined by you, appear natural -- let us say a Dragon, take for its head that of a mastiff or hound, with the eyes of a cat, the ears of a porcupine, the nose of a greyhound, the brow of a lion, the temples of an old cock, the neck of a water tortoise."  ---  --- DragonArt also includes guidelines on drawing a number of other sorts of fantastic creatures, including basilisks, chimeras, gargoyles, and griffins.  ---  --- For those interested in applying the guidelines presented in this book, a companion DragonArt Kit: How to Draw & Paint Fantastic Creatures that includes a compressed version of the book and some art supplies will also be available soon. Author Peffer is also the creator of the popular fantasy art Website NeonDragonArt.com, which can give anyone potentially interested in this book the opportunity to get a sense of the kinds of creatures they can learn to create themselves.
Yet another historical novel into which a lot of research and work was clearly put, but the result is dissatisfying largely because the author doesn't know how to write. ---  --- My single biggest objection to this book is the constant and annoying use of the author's alternative grammatical rules.  Comma splices and run-on sentences are not, and never will be, acceptable to me.  Occasional use can be overlooked, but Shaara peppers every page with them, tacking four or five or more predicates on to the same subject.  The effect is so glaringly obvious that it becomes difficult to continue reading. ---  --- The following example is made-up, but it is a good imitation of how Shaara writes: ---  --- "He turned in the saddle, rode toward his headquarters over the ridge, refused to look back toward the man receding in the distance, focused instead on the day ahead, forced himself to confront the bigger problems at hand." ---  --- One often finds whole paragraphs composed of several run-on sentences in a row like this.  The result is a book that reads like a rough draft, or maybe not even that;  it reads like a collection of notes preparatory to writing a rough draft.  I don't understand how authors get away with publishing such half-finished work, and I don't understand why readers put up with it. ---  --- Another problem is the lack of convincing characterization.  Everyone is vaguely noble here, with the exception of a few complete cads.  Washington loves his wife and longs for peace and home.  Cornwallis loves his wife and longs for peace and home.  Greene loves his wife and longs for peace and home.  I think you get the picture.  Few characters stand out on their own.  Even Lafayette is just another young officer.  The author assumes that we already carry our own perceptions about the major characters and will plug them in at the start of the book.  And Shaara's attempts at making his characters witty never work.  The result is a cast of characters that is tedious and dull. ---  --- Beyond that, I'm doubtful about the author's device of switching focus among the various characters in each chapter.  It's fine when we leap across the Atlantic and jump into Franklin's mind.  But the rest of the time, it doesn't work well.  I find that I sometimes have to flip back to the start of the chapter to remind myself who has the focus.  Either I'm a lazy reader (and I'm not), or the device isn't working well.  In addition, this device constrains the author to keep the narrative focused almost entirely on Franklin in France, and Washington, Green, Cornwallis and Howe in America.  That means that we get only glimmers of the happenings in Parliament and the royal court in England, and the continental congress in America.  In effect, this novel is really about Washington's military camp and Howe's dinner table, which makes the narrative unbalanced. ---  --- Some aspects of the story are interesting.  I enjoy reading about Washington's maneuvers, and the repeated frustration at coming up with an empty bag and finding that the British have eluded him.  I learned a fair amount about just where the various forces were, and when.  But I wish now that I'd just bought a decent beginner's history on the war.  Most of the book, as literary fiction, left me cold
My son likes this item.  The cars also fit his train set from imaginarium.  The only thing I didn't like about putting this together was the elevator.  Very tight fit and doesn't like to go up or down easily.  But everyone likes playing with it, from the 18 mo old to the 10 year olds
Is there anything more sanctimonious than filming your last concert and inviting a bunch of fellow overrated hacks (Clapton, Neil Diamond, Joni Mitchell) to the occasion, as if it's some monumental event? Please! As if the Band were anything worthwhile in the first place. Sorry, but the whole concept of a bunch of Canadians (well, four of five anyway) writing this stuff about Americana always came across to me as pretentious -- and it doesn't get much worse than that stupid shot of Levon Helm wheezing through "The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down." ---  --- These guys were just the beneficiaries of Rolling Stone/elitist rock critic propaganda. (And to think they made fun of prog bands for writing inane lyrics -- huh!) I think Martin Newell put it best when he called the Band "dreadful bearded ghastliness."
This is a pretty cool game that kills off the lonely, boring hours of my life, but I feel that some of the levels have too long of a time limit--Not that I can finish them that quickly, but I think they should be designed to be shorter levels. For instance, I think the Make the Moon level gives you 25 minutes to complete it. Well, that's just great if I have 25 minutes to kill, but that's quite a bit of time to just sit down and space out the world while I roll junk up into a ball. So like 10 tries on that level kills off 4 hours of my life, which gets me closer to my sweet, sweet death, but sometimes I like to have my playtimes in shorter fixes. For those times, I play Zuma, but I wish I could play a shorter version of Katamari
We bought this for my 7yr old son, and in 2 days he had totally destroyed it. Thank goodness we had it on a tile floor. He kicked the bottom and it broke letting out all the water! What a mess. Not worth the money
Received exactly as stated. My only complaint is in the description- they don't state the length of the cable. My tower for my computer is in another room that I keep at 65 degrees which is maintained constantly. I had to extend this cable by soldering on another 3 feet of wire, as the usb ports that are connected to my computer are mounted on my wall. I projected the cable to be about 6 feet, and if you do yourself, you're in for a surprise. This cable is only about 3 feet long, otherwise everything is fine. One last thing...The description doesn't state this but, the cable actually comes with the drivers for the phone models, which really helped me. ---  --- On a better note, shipping took a mere two days compared to the six days USPS estimated
Loved this camera the first month or so that I owned it.  Two years later my feelings are very different.  Batteries need to be recharged constantly.  Camera rarely turns on after being off it's dock for more than an hour.  All I can get is a flashing red light signifying that the batteries are dying.  Zoom is worthless, pictures turn out very blurry and pixelated.  Flash is also way too bright, half of my pictures are annoyingly "white" looking because of this.  Definitely going with Canon on my next purchase
My 6 & 8 year olds sons received this toy for Christmas. They are HUGE Pokemon fans so just the fact that it has Pokemon pictures on it made the toy worth it. Fortunately, it also happens to be fun to play. 2 to 4 players try to allow the fewest balls possible past their own paddles. The fewest points wins. Each player has their own scorekeeper for up to 5 games. Setting up the game after every round gets a little tedious, however it's not so bad if everyone helps. The 2 best things for me are that I don't mind playing (unlike the actual Pokemon cards which are a boring nightmare for me!) and it doesn't require batteries!! My 3 year old daughter likes to play too although she loses every time. We just don't tell her. --- If your kids like Pokemon, this is a good toy
I am a grandmother of nine!!! I heard a man playing harmonica in a furniture store while his wife shopped and it was wonderful! Instead of being annoyed, everyone within earshot was all smiles and a small crowd formed. I wanted to be able to do that also as I love music. I had tried piano and was all thumbs- but this Lee Oscar Major C Diatonic Harmonica is just the berries. It took me some time to figure out the breathing but there are lots of sources for good instruction. I would practice in the evening while my husband read. I kept saying "Honey, do you know what I'm playing?" He would say no. After about a week of this routine, my husband started to play "name that tune"! I have been so thrilled. This is a great harmonica with beautiful tones and the best price around. You won't regret this purchase if you love harmonica. I especially like the fact that the reeds can be replaced, if necessary, by unscrewing the case. This Lee Oskar harmonica is great- but the bottom line is practise. At some point I know I will feel comfortable enough to play in the hardware store while my husband shops
I had a lot of fun with this stove while it lasted but it did not last long -- about six months! I live on a sailboat and I used it every day; maybe someone who goes camping once a year will have a better experience. The burner did not simmer well (the flame kept creeping back up) but the grill worked great until the stove itself died. It seems to have a design flaw -- the regulator has an unusually narrow diameter tube and the propane tubes inside the stove are flimsy and wobbly. I called Century and they said this is the way the stove is supposed to be. Hmmmm. I did not think it would last long but I liked it so much that when it died I tried out another one. This one was immediately defective and I took it back. Neither Century nor Coleman seems to make a tough propane stove any more. Camp Chef may be a better, though much more expensive, choice for a person who does a lot of camping
This movie is by far one of the greatest movies ever made.  --- You will laugh all the way thru it..and enjoy when things were so much simplier in Hollywood
If Shakespeare could come back to life and see what they made with his play "Othello", he would remove Heaven and Earth crying out for justice. Be an actor in a play of Shakespeare it's difficult and only the best ones can do it, not mediocre actors with face of children. What's Martin Sheen doing here? He should be in better movies and in this trash, if you want a good "Othello" adaptation, get the movie with Kenneth Brannag and Laurence Fishburne, are good actors and a better movie
This adapter vignettes badly at wide-angle settings on my A700, so much so  --- that the field of view for which there is no vignetting is essentially identical --- to that without the adapter at the widest setting of the regular lens. --- Thus absolutely nothing has been gained by using the adapter. Canon, normally a --- responsible firm with many excellent products, is beneath contempt in marketing --- this lens.  I called Canon customer service and spoke with a sympathetic --- representative who took the matter up with "someone else".  The outcome was that --- they admit that there "is very little increase" in the non-vignetted field of view --- by using this adapter.  She said she would put my comments on a company-internal --- problem compilation called "customer voice".  I can only hope it reaches someone --- high enough to do some good
I couldn't watch this till the end. Bad production values, gimmicky, desperate to make a point about violence and voyeurism and evil and wanting to make it evah so clevah while my neurons slowly commit suicide from the énnui.  ---  --- If you wanna go all deep thoughts on violence and still get shaken - both intelectually and viscerally - try something like Miike's "Ichi the Killer". Makes this movie look so, so needless. ---  --- The leading man looked geeky and occasionally cute. 2 stars for the eye candy
This watch is attractive, fairly heavy and well made (esp for the price). One small complaint is that the glow in the dark hands barely show up. 4 1/2 stars
This book is nothing more than a chaotic brainstorm session with no pertinent information at all. You could save yourself time with a pen and some paper and a group of friends because thats all this author did. Book doesnt SHOW you how to start up any of the ideas it just lists them. It also has a plethora of grammatical errors and is almost as if the editor didn't even bother to read it before sending it to the presses. It is a complete waste of time and not worth the ninety cents it costs to buy it used.
The slippers are great; comfortable and good quality. Just like the pair I purchased in Lake George a few years ago. Buying them online was so convenient
Great tripod. We're using it in a television studio w/Sony VX-2000 cameras. They work great
The packaging the bracelet came in was quite upscale, nice black leather case, MUCH nicer than the bracelet deserved, however. --- The bracelet itself is light weight and the heart attached is ridiculously cheap. It is not rounded as pictured, but flat like a dog tag (only much smaller). I'm using mine as a base for a charm bracelet but I would never wear it by itself. I understand though that it is NOT an expensive bracelet and the weight is probably about right for .925 silver at that price
The video editing part of this software is completely useless.  It didn't come with a manual and I ended up buying on my own a book about how to use it.  It hasn't made a difference.  The software is completely uncooperative.  My computer more than meets the minimum requirements for running the program.  If you bought this software for the video editing, I recommend using the disc as a drinks coaster and buying something else
A little less psycho babble and a bit more logistical information would have suited me better.  Ms. Cantrell spends the majority of the book being a relationship/marriage counselor, and though it's true issues become larger in smaller spaces, there are more issues for women cruisers than just their relationship dynamics.  As I said, practical logistical information would have suited me better.
This was horrible, I installed this and within a 24 hour period, I was slammed with pop-ups and SPAM....And good luck trying to remove it.  Very dissatisfied customer
My husband and I just bought the Family Feud 2nd Edition DVD TV Games. ---  --- I have to say we both LOVED this game when it was first on (and on GSN as repeats) and I like the computer version. ---  --- We played this once by ourself and a couple of times with friends and we all have found that this game was boring & as someone said they can't believe they put this out. ---  --- If you are going to get this game then buy the computer version. ---  --- You have  --- 5 rounds ---  --- Round #1 --- Round #2 --- Double Money Round --- Triple Money Round --- Fast Money Round ---  --- You have Team A and Team B. ---  --- If you get one wrong answer and you click wrong then it says go for steal. --- HOWEVER, you only get one X. ---  --- Per Guide...IF an answer is revealed that Team A did not have written down, they press Wrong Answer button and pass the remote to Team B. --- Team B now has the opportunity to steal the round. ---  --- So most of the game was passing the remote back and forth. ---  --- IF the steal answer matches any one of the remaining answers they steal the round (even if you-Team A had that written down) and takes the money for any answer the other team has answered correctly (even if they got 4 out of 5 and both Teams say have the same answer) ---  --- The game itself was simple and basic. --- There was no real fun to it. ---  --- We tried to play it with others and they said afterwards that they found it boring and not all that fun. --- One person said they would have more fun watching the game itself on TV over playing this version of the game. ---  --- You get two markers (red and blue) to write on the two wipe-clean score cards. The negative on this is that the markers do not write all that good on these cards even though they were meant to. ---  --- Another thing is that the same game will come up more than once. --- We had the same question and answer come up even though we only played twice. ---  --- This is the 3rd or 4th DVD game we have been given or bought. --- This is the only one where we disliked it so much after playing it a couple of times that we are giving it away as we will not be playing it again
Wired Magazine has proven to me something it had never even occurred to me to imagine: That there is a level of cynical, style-whoring, inaccurate, myopic snarkiness that goes beyond merely "trading substance for style." Wired is consistently behind the curve these days, but that doesn't stop the publication from spinning every article like a golden truth you were too lame to know. In articles about controversial subjects, one side is routinely saddled with straw man arguments that are so blatant and artless that I find them offensive even when I disagree with the parties who have been set up for a fall. Just as often, features which don't discuss a contentious topic still have an edge to them, making fun of a person, group, or idea in a way that isn't enlightening or even humorous, let alone warranted by the subject matter. --- Generally, Wired is as mean-spirited as it is self-congratulatory. This attitude appeals primarily to the demographic of tech wonks and IT industry tourists professionally and personally deflated by the bubble burst, desperately trying to assert their relevance and relive their high-flying, know-it-all glory. Any content is easily outweighed by the sheer volume of half-truths, shoddy reasoning, and straight-up falsehoods which could easily be revealed and corrected by a casual investigation of the subjects treated in pages choked between high gloss, Yuppie/GenXer-targeted corporate mind-poison (advertising). --- Isn't the world of technology interesting and magical enough without mixing the spin, double-talk, and factual misrepresentation of a presidential debate with the impotent, absurd bravado of Battle Bot pre-match trash talk? People know little enough about how tech rules the world and how it can, quite plausibly, save it. This magazine could evangelize for technology's promise and educate about its current and future potential. Instead it concentrates on one-shots written in a style that passes for "hip" that forwards an attitude rather than a message, with an emphasis on sensationalism over accuracy, having more in common with advertising than edification
I was very disappointed in the content. There were not enough color plates and transparency in the color was lacking. Many of the instructions were used with black and white sketches and plates. Many of Kautskys subjects and scenes appeared to me to be "pre watercolor career" pencil sketches which I recognized. ---  --- Dark somber and sparse in my opinion
I have a one yr old who enjoys Babybug and a 2 yr old who enjoys Ladybug. These are just THE BEST children's publications. We save every Babybug for posterity because the art is fantastic. Can't recommend these enough to family and friends.
Pre-seasoned would be easier but twice the price too.  To avoid a smoke filled house you can season on the grill but make sure you can control the temp, too much heat and you cook all the seasoning off.  As far as performance it does everything a big heavy pot is supposed to do.  The basket is funtional for deep frying but not steaming.  Nice piece of cookware
I was impressed by the value and quality of this book.... Outstanding!!!! ---  --- It is all his plays and poems in one place with a nice look and feel to the book (for the price) you can't beat it. --- 
This magazine is devoted to American inventions and technology that have affected our lives.  In essence, this magazine is a historical magazine about American technology.  Within each issue are multiple articles about a historical invention.  The articles can either focus on the technology or focus on an individual who has been a key contributor to the advancement of that technology.  Typically, each issue also has an interview with an inventor or inventors whose contributions have materially affected our lives or society.   ---  --- The scope of the magazine is broad.  There have been articles on the Trans-Canada highway.  Another recent issue had an excellent article on tunnel boring machines.  In yet another article the development of refinery cracking was described in the context of the development of higher performance engines.  The contribution of high octane gasoline to the winning of the air war was mentioned, an interesting piece of trivia of which I was previously unaware. ---  --- The scope of the magazine is beyond the physical sciences.  Biology and the development of medical technology are also covered.  While the magazine is written at a level that an educated non-expert can understand, some of the biology related articles challenge my attention. ---  --- This magazine is an excellent source of technological history.  However, while the technical jargon used is that appropriate to a technology, this magazine is not light reading for those unfamiliar with a specific field.  As an example, I had to read portions of the article on refinery cracking a couple of times to understand the general description of how the cracking process works.  Therefore, while I highly recommend this magazine to anyone with an interest in the history of technology, realize that for some readers, for example elementary school students, this magazine could present a reading challenge. ---  --- Most articles also provide pictures or other artwork.  Frequently this artwork is unavailable from any other magazine source because there are so few magazines that deal with technological history.  The quality of the images varies because many of the pictures have not been well-preserved, but in many cases they are the only pictures available. ---  --- This magazine frequently mentions the Inventor's Hall of Fame in Akron, Ohio, which is sponsored by the United States Patent & Trademark Office.  A number of articles have covered inductees to the Inventor's Hall of Fame, showing that while the articles are historical in nature, they are also currently relevant. ---  --- There are a large number of magazines that are either about technology, or have had articles about technology.  There are a large number of trade magazines that cover technology.  Sometimes these magazines even have articles about the history of an invention.  However, the "American Heritage of Invention & Technology" is the only magazine of which I am aware the covers the history of invention and technology.  While the focus of the articles is American technology, it is inevitable that the relationship of foreign invention is covered occasionally as well when that technology was important in the development of American technology.  I consider this magazine to be excellent for anyone with an interest in historical technology, and is an excellent complement to other historical magazines.
i like a little bit of it, doesent mean its good, i wont throw it away or anything, ill just let it sift...wait...and look at the album cover most of the time. slayer is getting better though
Apparently she has loaded this stroller down with dolls, purses etc and has not let it out of her sight since it was delivered (on time incidentially!)
I really like this conditioner from Lush. I wash my hair everyday, and because of this (and long soaks in the bath) my hair gets pretty dry. This conditioner is absorbed really quickly and doesn't have an overpowering scent. I am not a huge fan of coconut, but this and the shampoo makes my hair smell like a tropical cocktail which I think is really nice. I wouldn't use it every day and don't recommend it unless you have dry hair that needs a bit of extra care. I have used American Cream but I think Coolaulin is better, at least for my hair. I have thick, straight, mid-length hair. Great conditioner to make hair soft but strong, and also shiny
this ninja sword is nice and has a light on it that makes it even coole
This shaving brush is perhaps the most inexpensive way to get a pure Badger bristle shaving brush. I've now been using it for a year and a half, and it has not shed any real amount of its bristles like the cheaper brushes on the market. The brush head remains densely packed and quite soft. Hopefully, it will remain that way for some time to come. In the meantime, I do enjoy the close and comfortable shaves that are aided by this brush. Because of it, I have sworn off of canned shave gels for every situation except travel. They just can't compare to your average $1.50 cake of shaving soap and this brush. This was a very worthwhile purchase for me
I was a huge fan of the jam , but Ive grown to despise Paul Weller and this CD strengthens my view. This is a covers cd and hasn't got a patch on albums like all mod cons or sound affects.With paul weller everything is about a  quick buck and ripping off a loyal fan base , with over a dozen jam compilations ,rarities, box sets and dvd's in the last few years.[since he bought the exclussive rights to all the jam recordings from the rest of the band].This album is bland  so give it a miss and spend your money on the new stiff little fingers cd which features bruce foxto
My grandson loved this beginners set of 500-plus cards. And what a price. About a penny apiece.
The back panel broke when taking it out of package, that is the packaging though not the clock.  It is in working order and keeps one 'on time'
This thing is a waste of time effort and money.  It falls apart the minute the child tries to swing the baby, not to mention it is too small for a two tear old to play with
This is Celestial Seasonings at their best-a plump bag of fresh tasty peppermint leaf, which brews up to a clean delicious cup of tea! Peppermint is one of the most enjoyable herbal teas with a naturally sweet, clean taste. ---  --- Peppermint is an herb that has many uses in traditional herbal medicine. It is reputed to relax the muscles of the digestive system which helps relieve nausea. Peppermint combats flatulence, promotes bile flow and digestive juices, and has a mildly anesthetic effect which also eases indigestion. It is supposed to relieve anxiety and tension, soothe headaches and calm symptoms associated with the menstrual cycle. ---  --- Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface
In 1976, MY FAIR LADY returned to Broadway, in a revival touted as the "20th Anniversary" production.  Perhaps most famously, this particular revival was the first big professional splash of a young soprano called Christine Andreas...   ---  --- At long last, this much sought-after cast album gets its CD premiere.  Christine Andreas is one of the best Eliza's ever captured on disc, and Ian Richardson's performance as beleaguered tutor Higgins is full of wit and humour.  George Rose (in a Tony-winning turn as Eliza's dustman father) is very enjoyable in his main numbers "With a Little Bit of Luck" and "Get Me to the Church on Time".  Jerry Lanning also makes for a fine Freddy, with the winsome "On the Street Where You Live". This recording also features the "Embassy Waltz" sequence, which was never included on the OBC, and only featured as a bonus track on the reissue of the OLC. ---  --- The production itself heavily recreated the original production, complete with Oliver Smith's sets and Cecil Beaton's costumes.  Hanya Holm's choreography was revived thanks to original dance captain Crandall Diehl.  Christine Andreas picked up a Theatre World Award for her breakthrough performance.  The show opened at the St. James Theatre on March 25th 1976, but later moved to the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre where it closed the following year after 377 performances.   ---  --- The following year, Andreas returned to Broadway in another important revival, the 1978 production of "Oklahoma!" in which she made a thrilling Laurey (cast album available on RCA); before cememting her position as Broadway's ingenue of choice, with the role of Frankie Frayne in the 1983 revival of "On Your Toes" (cast album available on Jay/TER).  More recently, she played Marguerite St. Just, in the original company of Frank Wildhorn's flawed "Scarlet Pimpernel" (cast album available on Atlantic). ---  --- I heartily recommend this particular MY FAIR LADY
I also purchased this product & was extremely disappointed when I found out it did NOT work.  Like the 1st reviewer wrote, it basically is a mini-fan that moves BUT it does NOT cool the car down at all!  There was absolutely NO difference in the temperature of my car after I installed it!  DON'T waste your money
I bought my wife a Nuvi 350 for her birthday last August (overall, we love the Nuvi, but the mount...no). The biggest "advantage" of the Nuvi over other GPS systems is its portability. Unfortunately, the suction cup appears to have been designed to subvert this feature. The cup sticks to the first window it is attached to very well...and then won't let go. When we tried to transfer it (after being attached only a couple of days), it left pieces of itself to the windshield and was very difficult to reattach to another windshield (though with difficulty and repeated tries, we have been able to move it).  ---  --- What this means is that you need a mount for each car you want to use this in. The mount and the charging/power wire (which you will also need since it is cumbersome to remove from the mount) are pretty darn expensive ($60-70) which is ridiculous for a "portable" system
I played "Atmosfear, The Harbingers" on VHS in the mid-90s and several years later bought a copy of the game through ebay.  Then, I saw this DVD update and gave in to temptation when the price was marked down.  Here's my judgement: 1) The mechanics have been simplified.  This has it's pros and cons.  It could have been made easier to learn without removing as many components.  2) The gatekeeper has less of a nasty/funny balance in the DVD update.  3) It is a major upswing to have his dialogue randomly disbursed. ---  --- One reviewer seemed to think the game was boring.  I'll guess, instead, that the people he parties with don't have the attention span for board games.  Too bad for them.  Atmosfear - The DVD Board Game get's a B+ from me
i think the people who give one stars aren't following the directions...wash your car at sunset and it dries perfectly (even in texas)...i don't think it really matters how you wash it; using the filtered water and not drying the car in the sun is what gives you no streaks or spots...the only problem i have is that it uses more soap than stated on the product...also the filter doesn't as long as i would like...this might be 'cause i was washing a van and not a smaller vehicle..
This is a great film with a bad guy that you root for from start to finish.  Action packed, and very smart.  Great cast too
I love this game I had it for SNES and it is one of my favorite
I've owned many pens over the years, expensive and cheap, but this Parker stands out as my "everyday" favorite. Yes a Mount Blanc is fine, but I've never felt comfortable carrying one around in everday work since I could lose it. The parker, on the other hand, is like a good pair of blue jeans--comfortable and accessible. Additionally, the styling will grow on you--it's unpretentious yet refined. A true classic
The ideas behind 15 minutes aren't bad at all. Take one Robert DeNiro, put him in New York, mix him with some American-dream hunting Eastern Europeans on a killing spree, and try to provoke some emotions, and have a sly dig at the American justice system. Lets see...nothing happened...only repulse. ---  --- If, like everyone else, you plan on watching this film because DeNiro is in it, you will be dissapointed. He puts in a tired performance, almost as if he knows the film is a load of B.S. The attempt to be hard-hitting goes horribly wrong, instead it's just repulsive over the top violence, and its pointless...naked prostitute gets hacked to pieces, why? There are ways to create provoking films with such violence but they have to have meaning, such as 8mm (the horrible subject of snuff movies, hard-hitting meaningfull film), 15 minutes is far from meaningfull. We all know there are some deranged psychopaths out there doing just that, but when converting it to a film, it needs a deeper meaning, otherwise it turns into melodramatic Hollywood [...]. ---  --- If you like brain-dead gore and violence, lack of plot and cringing melodrama. Go ahead
Item never came.  However in their defense refund was promptly given out.  I only wish that I had a chance to receive this one
I already have a single jogging stroller (not a BOB) and have been happy with it. We are in the process of adopting our second child, which we had less than 24 hours notice about, so a lot of money is going to legal costs, baby stuff, and my time off of work, and as a result I was concerned about spending this much on a stroller, but is was worth every cent. With the BOB Duallie, I am ecstatic, overjoyed, delighted, thrilled and looking forward to my next trip out.  ---  --- For my first trip out, I put my 2 year old and 11 week old in and went for a six mile walk. The trip was so smooth, both kids slept for most of the time. The seats recline enough so that my baby is nearly flat, no problems with his head bobbing around (pardon the pun). The shocks give this stroller an incredibly smooth ride, which transits to less work for my arms. I didn't realize how much effort went into the other stroller, pushing it and turning it. The smooth ride also allowed us to walk faster, a plus when trying to lose weight. ---  --- The stroller can turn in circles on itself, allowing for extremely sharp turns. Very nice, especially when inside a small store, like Starbucks. The windows up top are well placed enough that I can actually see my kid's face, not just their little bodies. The straps are the easiest to adjust of any stroller I've used. There is extra padding along the shoulder straps to cushion the kid's shoulders. The straps at the waist don't come out of the sides, (this is kinda hard to explain) the strap is attached in the center of the seat, and the sides come around the child, more like a belt and allowing for a snugger fit. Even my 70 year old mother had a great time pushing the stroller.  ---  --- As for the Mesa Orange, it is more like a burnt orange, with brown trim and I am very glad I got it! It is not at all like the neon orange it appears in some of the photos. Be sure to get the tray, I forgot to order it with the stroller. The storage is a little shallow, but being double wide, there is still plenty of room for stuff.
This is a great item for any collector or new fans to the X-men. All the older along with the newer issues look great. The CD includes all issues of the Uncanny X-men (1-461) along with Giant Sized and annual issues. There is also comprehensive biographies on the more popular characters and artwork and layouts of the Xaiver Institute. Could it of had more content, maybe, but this will keep one busy for a long time. With easy maneuverabiltity, this is a highly addictive CD with virtually months of entertainment
One at the front: The really own words of the master are excellent. One must make sure that only 43 sides of the only 7 x 5 inch small book are interviews with Bruce Lee. The rest consists of interviews with the former  interviewers. However, as a paperback this book costs not really a fortune.  But the words of the master are absolutely worth-while, as already  mentioned at the beginning
Yes, it plays videos (DivX + Windows Media tested so far). ---  --- Yes, it plays and sorts your photos. ---  --- Yes, it plays MP3s and sorts them by their ID3 tags (artist/genre/album/etc.). ---  --- Yes, it comes with a good TV audio/video out cable (letting you use the Zen like a high-def digital video player). ---  --- Yes, you can download your CompactFlash card directly onto the Zen hard drive. ---  --- Yes, it syncs with your Outlook tasks and calendar.  Wha?  Yeah.  It's hidden in there too.  Along with an MP3 alarm clock. ---  --- If you're going on vacation with a digital camera anytime soon, this is the multi-tool for you.  Leave the laptop at home.  The Zen has plenty of battery life and plenty of room for music, movies and photos to keep you moving for days when you're unwired from the office
I opened one packet (which was quite large for a serving, and shared it with 3 others in my office. We all took one spoonful and in unison said it was terrible. No one could continue eating it, and I sent back 8 of the 9 packets. Not edible, in our humble opinion.  --- Sorry
I think this is a great film.  Many critics and a few reviewers always complain about it's running time (128 minutes), insisting it's too slow.  Almost ALL of Clint's films (the ones he's directed) run long.  The running times range from just over 2 hours to just under 3 hours (the longest being Bird, at 2 hours, 40 minutes).  Sure, the film isn't PC, but it was made in 1975, when you didn't have to be PC.  But there is one thing that almost everyone agrees on...the mountain climbing scenes at the end of the film.  These are nervewracking and incredibly authentic.  Clint did all his own stunts in these sequences, and many professional rock climbers and mountaineers have praised these sequences.  And they are very intense to watch, because you know the actors are really up there.  No CGI in those days.  This is one of the reasons they work so well.  CGI looks fake anyway.  It makes movies seem like cartoons.  People know it isn't real.  CGI reliance should be reduced in Hollywood, as it takes the tension out of action scenes.  ---  --- Check this film out.  It's worth all of its 128 minutes.   --- 
Because of tummy troubles, my doctor ordered me on a very bland diet.  Well this stuff is JUST what the doctor ordered, as it is almost completely tasteless.  I can't give it a one star which qualifies as  hating it, as I can't hate anything that has pasta as one of the ingredients, but it is not good.  It makes Kraft Mac and Cheese seem very exciting!  I would not reorder and would fear ordering anything else from Annie's.  This would only be for young children who hate anything with a taste to it
I had seen the "gold/orange" face version of this Casio watch for years but didn't know it came in black (and white) until I found it on Amazon. I really like the classic good looks of this watch... nice rugged case, smooth-clicking rotating bezel, sturdy band, etc. For <$60, this watch truly delivers awesome quality and value. The digital features are great too. I've received a few compliments from co-workers on this watch already. Overall, an awesome watch for the money and I couldn't be happier with it
Thanks for carrying this coffee. Our local stores only carry the Medium Roast & Cappuccino. It's nice that you carry such a variety
Does a good job for what it was designed for... did have some trouble "recognizing" certain types of batterie
What a shame this DVD transfer is so aweful, because the movie is great. I have seen this movie before on SBS TV (Australia) and have been wanting a copy since. But this DVD looks like a transfer from an already poor quality VHS copy. Very disappointed
Who would give the green light to this?  ---  --- It is a total remake of the 1968 classic. The only difference is that there is  a slight revamp to reflect modern times.  ---  --- Since it mirrors the original then it deserves what the biggest complaint hsould be of it...it pales in comparison to the original. This was really weird to remake this movie.  ---  --- "Dawn of the Dead" was cool b/c it had a new, fresh spin to the story. This has no scares, no atmosphere, no innovations and no riveting performances.  ---  --- Skip this one 
How many times can you wear out the same story line. Kahlan lost, Kahlan found, Kahlan lost again, Kahlan found again. Or Richard lost, Richard found, ohp...Richard lost again, Richard found again. Goodkind has run out of ideas. He should put the Sword of Truth series down and move on to something fresh.
They sparkle well and look as good as anything else I have seen at the mall stores.  I like the non-cup style studs, as I think they allow more light to flow through the stone.  Save your cash and get these.  She will be very happy and you can spend the extra money on fishing lures or something.  ;-) ---  --- DO NOT go to Jared's jewelers if they are near you...they are evil people. 
  I bought this watch about 7 months ago and had all the issues listed to some degree or anouther but all in all it was still a good watch for the price.  That is untill 5 days ago when all the digital functions on the watch quit and then a day later went blank leaving me with a standard watch. But I guess you get what you pay for
I bought these for a trip to Costa Rica and used them every day. They are comfortable, easy to focus, and a great choice for the price. These are perfect for folks like me who are interested in casual use for travel, concerts, sports, etc
The strap on mine broke and I was very quickly sent a replacement.  I expressed my concerns about the size of the belt( I have a small frame and it is big on me) and I was told a newer design was in the works and they would send it to me once it's done.  Very friendly, amazing customer service, that's hard to find these days! 
This suit is exactly what I ordered -- small enough for training/racing but not as small as a "traditional" Speedo suit
I have very fond memories of this short lived Irwin Allen classic.The picture and sound on the dvd's is better than i remember.The video transfer is very nice and the sound is crisp albeit in mono.I give volume one of the "Time Tunnel" five stars for pure television enjoyment.Volume one contains the first 15 episodes of the show,The unaired extended version of the pilot,Irwin Allen's behind the scenes home movies, visual effects,camera test,still galleries and promotional tv and radio spots.Once again it is lacking in cast interviews. many of the actors from this show are still alive,so why didn't the studio interview them for the dvd set?.It would be a welcomed addition to any release to see the actors today and get their thought's on the show.My only gripe is that this show only ran for one season,so why split it into two volumes?.Surely the studio could have compiled all 30 episodes into one boxed set at a reasonable price
Hi, ---  --- I am highly regretting buying this mat. ---  --- It is too bulky to carry. ---  --- And it came on sale in Big 5 for half the price of Amazon
Dear Film Company Jackasses, ---  --- Surely you know we already hate you for your greed - Why do you add insult to injury by taking fine films like "The Great Santini" and cutting them to Full Screen? ---  --- Yet another fine film marred, no doubt, by some big company's desire to cut corners. Burn, Hollywood, burn
Typical Aegs shoot 280-310 and most fields that are moderated have a 350 fps limit so 400 fps aegs is great if u wanna play by yourself or in a non official place.....i also sure hope that a sniper can shoot 500 being they are normally single shot.....theyre not in the same categlory so your not comparing apples and apples.... this is a very nice gun....it is expensive for the parts included and the functionality...this gun is defidently not a beginner gun so i only reccomend it for people who have owned 2 or more aegs previously (AEG-TM ICS ,CA, AIM M4,G&P,G&G,Ect...
I have tried EVERY type/brand of harmonica holder for the last 8 or 10 years and FINALLY found one that works great and doesn't look like some type of orthopedic device. --- I will caution anyone using this harp holder to be careful when adjusting it not to bend the flat stamped spots that keep the springs in place. I managed to break one that way but was still able to finish the show in spite it being broken because it's made so well. --- www.dalemarsh.com
The program seems to be much more accurate.  I am still learning but I feel it was a worthwhile investment.  I can write my e-mail much faster now.  I highly recommend it and I feel it was worth the cost
I give this movie 1 star because it lies to the viewer. This movie is NOT Bram Stoker's Dracula, but a rip-off of the character and then puts the modern spin on the story. If it was named something else or even kept the name Dracula out of it to begin with but called him a different name I'd give it 5 stars. ---  --- If you want to see the real Dracula story first read the actual book by Bram Stoker, then watch the silent film Nosferatu. Nosferatu is the only Dracula movie that gets the story right. Dracula is a monster, he's not a star crossed lover at all and wasn't intended to be. People wanted there to be some hidden message so they could justify a reason for their otherwise worthless literature degree but there simply isn't one. It's a horror tale, not a vieled porn book, and certainly not a love story. If anything the ones that fail to understand Dracula time and again are his victims who fall prey to his seduction by being anthropomorphic toward him
I bought these because they come with foam inserts to help collect leakage. I'm a 38 DD and use the large flange for my medela pump, so I too found the sharp edge that contacts the breast was cutting into my sore areola/nipple. The ameda shells had a round edge and were much more comfortable, although leakage city!  My sore nipples got nearly instantly better using my brest friend (great proper latch!), and treatment for a mild yeast infection. Hope this helps
I have been suffering from depression since I was 15 years old. My mother bought this bracelet for me at the age of 21 as a surprise (after some hinting; I was patiently waiting to buy it on my own!) I must say it is one of the most beautiful and meaningful gifts anyone has ever given to me. I don't believe I have taken it off for a single day in the several months I've owned it; it fits perfectly, matches everything and its beautiful message keeps me more centered and hopeful. It also keeps me feeling close to my mother while I'm away at college. She doesn't know it yet, but I hope to buy her the same bracelet for Christmas. It's a simply amazing gift for yourself or someone else
The railings on the Schwinn 820p did not line up with the screw holes on the frame by several inches!  It was impossible to assemble. ---  --- With any quality control at all, these measurements are checked on every item that leaves the factory.  Human error is then not a factor.  This is a defect that should never happen. Schwinn/Nautilus has zero quality control.  That is simply a fact of the most basic quality control standards.   ---  --- You are therefore definitely taking your chances with this or any other Schwinn or Nautilus product.  With zero quality control, no telling what else can prove to be wrong. ---  --- And though the warranty says "1 year on parts", the warranty then goes on to say that there will be a charge for the installation of any defective or replaced parts.  So what is the 1 year warranty on labor?  Nothing, obviously. ---  --- I wish I never had purchased this product, myself
My children have loved playing in this tent. I like it also because it is not huge and doesn't take up a lot of room, but it is also not made out of very durable material.  I picked it up to move it out of the way and it ripped.  It is easy to pop-up and down, just will probably not have a very long lifetime with kid's play
While my wife refuses to put it on her white van, she loves it and even I get a kick out of it
This book is terribly organized.  I'm not sure what happened in writing this book, but it seems clear that Professor Jones did not compile this in the chronological order that it is printed in. ---  --- My main complaint is that rather obscure concepts/people/events are repeatedly referred to, and then only later does Jones bother to define them.  (I would almost prefer that he not define something at all, rather than offering a definition 100 pages after his first reference to it!)  The fact that the book has an index only further infuriated me - clearly the author/publisher knew where all these terms were located throughout the book, yet did not bother to offer a definition in the appropriate/first reference to the concept. ---  --- Examples are numerous, but here are a few: --- **robe nobility: referenced on pages 139, 152, 183.  Defined? (pg. 183) --- **sans culottes: first referenced on page 189, defined on page 231. --- **Louis-Sebastien Mercier: referenced on pages 11, 138, 178, 189, 200, 204, 212, 213.  When did Jones provide information (that he was a "journalist, dramatist and observer of Parisian mores") on just WHO Mercier is?  Page 215. ---  --- Aside from that, there are some plain old errors.  One such is in the text box on Saint Genevieve.  Jones mentions that she negotiated with Frankish military chieftains in the 570s and 580s.  She died in 512AD, so the negotiations seem improbable.  (470s & 480s would be correct, but I should not have to figure that out.) ---  --- The redeeming quality of the book is that if DOES offer information on Paris if you are willing to sift through the above mentioned annoyances.  And Paris is not such a bad subject
First thing to do is to make sure which lens you are buying. The kit lens comes with Canon 20D, 30D, 300D, or XT is the lower version, non USM one. On the higher version USM ones, you will see the red color "USM" at the front of the lens.   ---  --- According to the reviews, compare with the non USM ones, optically they are the same. However, the USM motor does focus faster and much quieter.  ---  --- People complain about the build quality. Actually I feel that it is really not that bad, much better than the Canon 50mm f1.8 II. The USM auto focus performance is fast, never hunt, and much quieter than the 50mm f1.8 II. It fits nicely on the XT. ---  --- Do not compare this hundred dollar lens to other lenses cost three times or more. We have to compare apple to apple. If you know the limitations on this lens and use it wisely, the images will come out nicely.  ---  --- 1. This is not the lens for indoors low light conditions. If you need to take lots of indoor pictures and the flash is not allowed, go get a different lens. (For example, I use a Canon 50mm f1.4 for this kind of situation.) ---  --- 2. The distortion on 18mm is quite a bit. Avoid taking strait lines (like buildings) pictures on the edge while wide open. However, this can be easily corrected on computers. ---  --- 3. Step down the aperture to F8 or F11, the resolution will be improved a lot even at the corners.  ---  --- Overall, the performance is very good for a hundred dollar lens. It is very light weight and highly portable while traveling. This fits my needs as a cheap but fast with good image quality walk around lens. 
when i ordered i didnt read the word double...so when i got it n put it on it was pretty thick and i was like whooa..but its good stuff just heavy for me so im ordering a regular one now
I got this for X-mas and I am a huge Spyro fan! I started with the second one and this is now the fifth release not counting gameboy games, and the second on Playstation 2. The last one, Enter the Dragonfly wasn't SO successful and I feared there wouldn't be another; but here it is! And SO many things have been added. Buying items at item shops, keychains for keys to open boxes, riding around in the professors new gadget ball, mini-games featuring not Spyro, but his friends,etc. i kind of miss flying Spyro through the rings in the speed race, but...This new Spyro is clearly trying to keep up with newer platform games that others seem to enjoy, but luckily they have kept things from being too hard that you give up eventually and you don't have to worry about wandering around and getting lost in the game. Spyro must learn new tricks like spin pole,etc. as he moves along, and he even meets little dragons like him- Ember,Flame. Hard enough to keep you playing to get through the challenge, but it never seems overwhelming. Some of the mini-game's second levels are a pain, but you can come back later. The strategy guide is also helpful. This time, I don't think anyone can complain that Spyro hasn't evolved or that it's the same old thing, but Spyro fans love Spyro even if it was the same game but with new adventures and levels. He's Spyro! Hours of enjoyment
Daylight savings time in the US has changed.  These watches continue to use the old daylight savings time rules.  While you may not mind having to manualy set the watch for a few weeks, twice a year, it kind of defeats the whole purpose
I have used this pillow for the last 2 months, with 2 to go.  I do like the shape of the pillow, I just wished it was a little longer.  I had been trying to use a king size pillow to cuddle with, but it was TOO big and hard to turn with.  This pillow makes it easy to keep next to you and to turn over.  I would just like it to be longer so I can have the little end between my legs, and the rest up higher so I can cuddle with it.  When between my legs (which helps) the rest of the pillow only is around my stomach and I wish it came up to my breast area so my arms could cuddle around it a little easier.  I would still give one to a pregnant friend as it is nice to sleep with.  Beware, my husband calls this the "Sperm Pillow", but if you can get past that, it's a nice pillow. 
The plot is quite good. However, the style and the overall structure are somewhat weaker that in later Grisham's stories. Still well worth the time
This language learning software is the best I have ever tried.  You can work with the Lesson material in several different ways, utilizing your favorite method of learning.  Expecially great is the speaking unit which allows you to match your pronunciation with that of the instructor.  The package is well worth the cost
This is a great and stylish watch.  I always get compliments.  It is heavy, sturdy and looks much more expensive than what the actual price was.  It looks great with any suit and looks really good with a nice blue shirt.  Highly recommended.  The stainless steel is much shinnier than what the picture shows.  Ignore the comment below.  You will be happy with this watch!
The review before this one is what got me interested with this produce and so I decided to buy it and let me tell you, it was the best choice ever. I have no real experience with any other wipes, but have read reviews of all the promes other have given like wipes dry out or turn color...THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN WITH THIS ONE. I love that I just put the whole pack in, plastic and all, and it stays nice and toasty for my son's bottom. He loves it and no longer has to deal with cold wipes anymore. I love the spring inside to keep the wipes on top. I love that it heats from the top. The wipes never turn yellow and is ALWAYS moist. I also love the little handle on the top, so I just have to pull the plug and easily carry it to another room if need be! The product is hight recommended
This is the Japanese version of breadcrumb (pan=bread, a Portuguese loan-word, and"ko-"  is "child of" or of "derived from".) Panko are used for katsudon, tonkatsu or cutlets served on rice or in soups. The cutlets, pounded chicken or pork, are coated with these light and crispy crumbs and fried. They are not gritty and dense like regular crumbs. They are very nice on deep fried shrimps and decorative for a more gourmet touch
I bought this product for my 3 month old for Christmas and when I went to play with it, the remote didn't work. I did everything it said to do and it still didn't work. So, I took it back and just exchanged it for another thinking it was just faulty. When I took it out, the remote to it also didn't work. It says it has to be on "Play" (not Try me or Off) and it has to do it's short musical fanfare after you push the button on the front and then you can use the remote but nope. You should be able to control the volume, the song options, and be able to switch from colors to music but no. It just plain doesn't work. I really want it to work because it would be great in the car but sadly, I will have to take it back but this time I'll get my money back......I do not suggest buying this product
If you find iMovie complicated, this product is not for you.  If you prefer automatic quick solutions this product may not be for you.   ---  --- If you find that you would like more control of your video/audio than you find in iMovie but don't want to spend a lot of money, boy have you come to the right place. ---  --- I take quite a lot of home video (new baby and all) and found that iMovie would frustrate me when I couldn't do some more advanced tasks. ---  --- iMovie is a great intro product.  If you are new to video, use it until you find that you feel limited (many will never will get to that point). ---  --- When (and if) you find that you feel some constraints in iMovie, then move up to FCE. ---  --- A note for most, iMovie and FCE typically are not for DVD/Hard Drive camcorders.  They don't have the output necessary to directly connect.  You may want to check with your camcorder manufacturer to see what they have to convert the DVD/HD to content that is usuable in these products
Unusual and fresh tasting. I really, really enjoyed these nut blends. I will definitely order them again
The music on this album is performed so exquisitely; the orchestrations so subtle and yet illuminating, that one is almost tempted to forget what a "What for?" musical this is.  ---  --- Donna Murphy plays the title character of Fosca, a hugely unprepossessing woman who suffers from more maladies than there are stars in the sky. She lives in a remote miltary outpost where she falls in love with the handsome, virile Giorgio. Giorgio in turn is having a torrid affair with the beautiful, but vapid Clara, a married woman back home. However from the time Giorgio comes into Fosca's sphere, she becomes this relentless succubus in her pursuit of him. She shows up EVERYWHERE he happens to be; her ferocity matched only by her inexhaustive capacity for self-pity. To depict Fosca musically, Sondheim comes up with the most monochromatic score of his career. Everything is SO lugubrious, dark, portentous, tragic; punctuated by militaristic strains (with snare drums)because the soldiers like to...umm...march.  In the end, Giorgio is worn down enough by Fosca's attentions that he succumbs. He believes he has fallen in love with her, shortly after which she...dies. ---  --- As I mentioned earlier, the material is beautifully performed (Marin Mazzie and Jere Shea render the opening "Happiness" with a marvelous sense of delicacy and sensuality. Donna Murphy evokes the proper pathos in the haunting "Loving You."), but you come away wondering what the point of it all is. If Sondheim is trying to show us how love is largely a chronic disease, then he succeeds admirably
I am totally a fan of cloth diapering now that I've actually done it.  I must admit I was very apprehensive before I actually used them because I thought it would be so much work, but it really amounts to doing a load of laundry every other day... not hard.  These diaper covers are fantastic.  I have not had a single leak with them.  When my daughter was first born, a friend gave us several packs of newborn disposable diapers that we used for the first few weeks, and we had numerous leaks.  We actually used the newborn size of Super Whisper Wrap for the first two months and are on the small size now.  She was 6 pounds 11 ounces when she was born.  I use the chinese prefold diapers with them.  I tried two different types of the Gerber prefold, but they're just not as absorbant and were quickly saturated.  What sold me on these covers is how I can wash them with diapers when they are soiled and I don't have to hand wash them or anything
The last reviewer didn't see any point to this software. Partially that's true---you don't need it to create your photostamp, you can do the same thing online. However, there is one big plus to the software product: buying a single sheet of PhotoStamps direct from their website costs $24.99 + $2.99 shipping, at this writing. In contrast, Amazon is selling this "boxed" version ---which includes a free voucher for a single sheet of stamps---for seven bucks less than that. Do the math
I have been a faithful subscriber for approximately 10 years.  This is the magazine that impatiently wait for every month.  It has beauty tips, interesting articles, fitness information, etc.  I even gave my mother a gift subscription.  It's the best
Just today I randomly selected a movie, that movie was "Henry".  I had never heard of it before, and I figured that I was in for your average, run-of-the-mill low budget slasher flick.  Though it is low budget, it is by no means your ordinary serial killer movie.  In fact, the gritty film and minimalist effects only adds to the stark realism of this nightmarish character study. ---  --- Meet Henry, a very quiet and serene man with vacant and staring eyes as well as a calm disposition.  Watch as he goes to work, watch as he hits the bar with his buddy Otis, and watch as he calmly and systematically butchers random people.  This film does not exploit the violence though; it is very frank and direct, treating it as though Henry were doing nothing more than cleaning the dishes or taking a stroll in the park. ---  --- This movie is a lot of things, and when it was all over, I just had to sit back and take a few breaths, have a cigarette - and try to gauge my reaction(s).  I was surprised to note that while this film is disturbing, it is also pretty funny in some parts, though only funny in the blackest sense of the term.  There is no social commentary in this movie, nor does it provide any closure.   ---  --- The DVD is great, awesome extras including fragmented interviews with the genuine serial killer Henry Lee Lucas, awaiting lethal injection on death row.  Very fascinating
WATCH IS THE BEST ON THE MARKET.  I'VE HAD IT A MONTH NOW AND LOVE IT.  THE COMPLIMENTS KEEP COMING IN AND AMAZON'S PRICE WAS THE LOWEST I COULD FIND ANYWHERE BOTH ON THE NET AND AT THE DISCOUNT STORES.  IF YOU WANT TO CATH THE LADIES EYES, THIS IS THE WATCH FOR YOU
A great exercise tape--plenty of variety and feels like it is doing the trick.  If only Denise would come into the house and make me exercise daily, this would really work
I got this set as a party gift for a sleep-over for my kids. --- They loved it and the price was really hard to beat
Pros: Uses less batteries than the Space Shuttle... (6 AAs) ---  --- Great idea gone to H*** quickly due to LACK OF PRODUCT SUPPORT! Apparently the person in charge of designing and marketing tapes for these units suffers from Attention Deficit Disorder and is totally unable to remotely consider any meaningful COMPLETE LINE of tapes. Red, blue,white pearl (paper?) - Yellow smiley faces. Green metalic. Black on clear - but no white on clear... ---  --- There appears to be little, if any, hope for those who might actually like to COLOR CODE products in any single medium - plastic, paper, polyester, metallic,etc. Just whatever come to the designer's head is what's released. Five types here. Two there. One over here... No rhyme nor reason. ---  --- Dymo has done themselves NO FAVORS HERE
I have had this awesome little device for about 5 years now.  In that time there have been TWO attempts by car thieves to take my car (a Honda Civic).   ---  --- The first attempt it looks as though they saw it and moved on (door was open, things shuffled about).  This was while it was parked at my school in the midst of a string of Honda Civic thefts (there had been no less than 10 thefts of modified civics in the past two months--which is what inspired me to buy this).  Given the context of the situation and since nothing else was taken or disturbed, the only logical conclusion is that they were after the car itself. ---  --- The second attempt was by a much more aggressive would-be thief.  This one worked at the clutch lock for a good long time.  When I got to my car the next morning, the clutch pedal covering was broken off and the pedal bar itself was bent slightly off to the right, however the lock remained solidly in place.  They even broke into my trunk to retrieve the tools to try and pry it off.  They had no such luck.  The pedal cover was replaced for $10 and all was well. ---  --- I would trust any car to this in any situation.  Certainly you should use an alarm as well, and be conscious about where you leave your car, but this is a fantastic deterrent. ---  --- This product is the best 60 bucks I have ever spent on my car.  GET IT
Drummer Hoff is an unusual story that uses repetitive phrases and rhyming to tell the story of Drummer Hoff, the man who "fired it off." In this story, a group of men are preparing to fire a cannon. Each man brings something different. One man brings the barrel, one man brings the carriage, and at the every end of each stanza it says "but Drummer Hoff fired it off." ---  This story uses childlike drawings to demonstrate the pattern of rhythm in the story. The colors are fairly bright which in turn give the story a comical appeal. The story itself doesn't have any significant moral element to it...it is just a fun book. The rhyming in this story is very catching and the pictures really make the story very humorous. By the end of the story the reader can see that the big explosion has just caused a big mess. ---  --- Children will like the flow the story and parents will enjoy reading it aloud. A good holiday gift.
The texture of this cleanser is waxy.  I could barely get it off my face, and I broke out badly after using it.  I double checked the packaging to make sure it really was supposed to be a facial cleanser, and that I hadn't mistakenly put some other product on my face.  It smells wonderful, though.  I tried to think of alternate uses for the product, but finally threw it away
At first loved it because the travel system, with stroller, is so light and doesn't look doudy like other systems.  --- But: the harness buckle is so difficult to fasten that the baby gets irritated before we even get to the car. The straps never tangled, but it is extremely difficult to adjust as needed. The carrying handle has to moved up/down with two hands, a button on each, that must be simultaneously pushed to lower the handle. Difficult to perform when you're already reaching into the center of the car to even get to the baby. --- Yes it is a trendy color with the gray, but it is not cotton and is not padded well and does not breathe! It is horribly hot for the baby. Still love the stroller by combi, but I never recommend the car seat to ANYONE. Luckily, time to move 5 month old to a larger seat anyway.
The leather case works great.  Easy access to buttons, space for business cards and SD cards.  Ah!... the smell...leather.  Five stars
Fantastic.  Speed of delivery during Xmas. WOW.   Will use this store again.  AAAAAAAAAAA++++++++++++++++
The trilogy just stunned me and I worked at trying to understand its complexities. Then I read this book, and everything made sense. At first I declared that the trilogy was better than 'The Lord of the Rings' but could not explain why. This book nails it. It will be wonderful if you read the trilogy, read this book, and share everything with your children. Remember when 'expanding your consciousness' was all the rage? No? That's OK.  All these books do it with a basis in science. Buy the darn books. Buy them for your friends
This earrings were much larger than they seemed.  They sparkle and catch the light like prisms.  They made a fabulous present
I already own a Syncopro Shaver so I decided to get one for my dad. He had been asking about electric shavers for a couple of weeks prior to me purhasing one for him. The reason I choose Braun is because I love my shaver and have never had any problems. Just keep it clean and buy the replacement parts when needed and you'll be ib great shape. I love the way it shaves nice and clean!!!! I trully recommend this product.
Cheap! but still useable. Inside had a stained piece of paper/cardboard?... Flimsy leather. Not recommended
Your site was the only place where could find  a replacement for my lost Nikon UC-E6 ---  --- USB Cable for my Nikon Coolpix 3100.  Even Nikon could not satisfy my request. ---  --- THANK YOU ---  --- Cynthia Valesi
I am by no means a computer idiot, I audit computer systems security for a living. I have had to contact customer support (webchat) at least 3-4 times during the first 30 days of installing the software. The install was on a brand new system (Windows XP Pro), with all of the Microsoft patches and service packs and little to nothing else installed.  ---  --- First Pest Patrol would crash numerous times a day until technical support walked me through a complex workaround to prevent an Active Protection error window appearing over 100 times every 10 minutes (which you had to click to clear each one). Second, the firewall would tell me I was not authorized to visit certain webpages until technical support walked me through a complex process of deleting certain files created by the firewall and resetting the firewall after a process involving safe mode. Third, Pest Patrol never would run a thorough scan. I'd receive two separate errors that either said a fatal error occurred with the Pest Patrol GUI, or that system resources was not available. I contacted the customer support and they told me that yes, sometimes Pest Patrol doesn't work at all unless you use MSCONFIG to disable all startup services (systems.ini, etc) reboot, run Pest Patrol, then use MSCONFIG to enable the startup services. It was a canned reply during a live web session, which means that the operators were probably used to giving since it likely occurs to many people. ---  --- I haven't tried out the third solution yet because I wanted to remind myself to write an Amazon review. ---  --- If you are looking for simplicity, or don't know much about computers, look elsewhere. Otherwise you will be in for one major headache trying to implement several technically involved workarounds. I'll give it two stars, since it didn't cause my dog to choke, explode my house, or cause irreparable damage to clothing (which is my one-star). 
This effort shows it's age. In addition, there is a uncomfortable tone in the narration that smacks of a reliance on a pseudo-scientific method somewhat reminiscent of Mengele. I suppose it's possible for it to be taken as tongue-in-cheek by those at the post-graduate level of study at the Cheech and Chong School of Anthropology. However, I have to admit I was unable to prevent myself from throwing this one in the trash after one viewing
When this show was on back in the day on Fox I couldnt believe I was actually watching something I could relate to. There doesnt seem to be really that many Tv shows that deal with dark and The Real Life experinces of Real People. If ya ask me when it was on. It was actually something that gave me some relief. I deal everyday with some experinces re-lated to the show. Its somewhat of a constant battle. Enough about me. Im really glad all 3 Seasons are out. And im also glad I didnt have to wait many years either. One thing I didnt like about Fox when Titus was on they kept moveing it around. It wasnt fair for the show. Then the next thing ya know there were some repeats then it was gone. Im not really happy with Fox cause Titus still should be on tv or had a much longer run then it did. I hope Chris shows up in something else soon. Hes got one of those faces ya never forget
I did the research on this product and it was one of the best. I don't know that to be true due to the fact that the software that they sent me was a demo version that was outdated for use. I have to buy another software package to opperate the product that had stated in the description that the software was included. One if not the only reason I had purchased it. I e-mailed tiger.com and received no reply. If your going to sell something false advertisement is not the way
I am having the same problem.  I ordered this product from Amazon on August 26.  It is now October 26.  I have not recieved it yet.  I have never had this problem with Amazon before.  I may have to cancel my order too and go somewhere else.  It is a shame, because Amazon does have the best price I have found so far.  I gave it 5 stars only because I had to give it a rating.  I wanted to be fair to the company, but I have honestly never used one
I never subscribe to anything! This magazine is great. There are usually quite a few recipes with ingredients that are easy to find and a nice mix of healthy recipes and indulgent recipes.  I'm on a health kick right now and find  most cooking magazines aren't that useful to me. I might enjoy reading them but I don't actually use their recipes. I've made 4 of the recipes out of this last Everyday Food issue and they were very healthy (lots of veggies, chicken, brown rice, salmon etc.) tasted really good, and were also fast which is a bonus for me. I'd give this magazine 10 stars if I could :-
This is a great tool. This help people to get back on track "physically". It is hard to find effective training tools. This one is great for those who need back door training. Simple to use and Rock Hard! Up yours
Got this ring last Christmas for my wife. It still looks very nice and looks more expensive than it is. She gets lots of compliments on it when she wears it
Flying Down to Rio is the film that marks the first pairing of Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire. The two are not the main attraction though; the film stars Dolores del Rio and Gene Raymond in a tempestuous love affair. Raymond is a band leader who always falls for beautiful women. Del Rio is engaged to a man in Rio de Janeiro but secretly harbors feelings for the American. In a back and forth romance, the two occupy plenty of the film. The rest is taken by extravagant musical numbers including "I Like Music," "The Carioca," and "Orchids in the Moonlight" on top of a wonderful number that exhibits chorus girls dancing on top of airplanes! ---  --- The cast is good and the story is pretty standard, but it is the music that spices up the film. Definitly take a look at this movie, which is filled with inuendo only pre-code films could get away with and music only those early musicals featured
The installation instructions require you to tighten the fitting to the point that you break the little black intstallation tool.  Once the tank is empty it can not be refilled unless the station has an adapter.  I have not found a station with one yet.  You can not get the adapter off the tank with out the tool you broke.  They dont sell the black tool and it's designed so nothing else fits.  You have to purchase the whole fitting just to get the tool.  Another $17.00 down the drain. After my third one, I finally fabbed a tool out of a bolt head by grinding the head into the right shaped triangle. 
This book is outdated for the 21st century. The basics are there and in great detail but most of the information is useless for today
do not waste your money. I wish I could give it zero star
I had never read any of  Vernor Vinges books before, but i had heard he was an excellent author, so I thought I would try this.  Boy, am I glad I bought it used on Amazon for about only $4.  I simply had no idea what was going on in this novel. The plot is unintelligible. I dont know what the Bioweapon  the jacket refers to is? I dont know what "the Rabbit" is.  I see that numerous other reviews here, did not know what was going on either. I do not understand how someone could write so incoherently.  --- The concept of someone who had Alzheimers getting cured & entering a future society is great - but it never goes anywhere.  The only reason I did not fall asleep, was that I was trying to figure out what was going on, but I did could not  even finish this book
I thought the steaks were really good. They were tender and delicious. They were a little small for my boyfriend and cooked up fast. I thought they were the perfect size for myself. Delivery was fast

My wife has purchased and worn this style for many years; however, the items received were nothing like the picture.  The pictured item was exactly what she wanted, lace waistband AT (not below) her waist and high-cut leg openings; the delivered item was an entirely different style with an entirely different (and unsatisfactory) fit.  She'd opened all the items to check them individually before discovering that items had to be unopened and in the original shipping packaging in order to be accepted for return
Malfunctions: --- 1. The port for connecting to a PC became loose and unreliable, frequently disconnecting while I was trying to transfer music. --- 2. The little knob stopped working properly:  it was no longer possible to fast-forward. --- 3. Finally, the screen cracked for me and no longer displayed anything. ---  --- Design issues: --- It would be nice to be able to access music by ID3 tag (i.e. artist, genre, song title). --- It takes a long time to start up, generally ~20 seconds but up to ~2 minutes if you just changed the music on it. --- It's nice that you can delete music on the player without having to connect it to a computer, for instance if you have it on shuffle and you come across something that you never want to hear again.  However, the interface to do this was so inconvenient (including audio playback stopping and long lag times) that I rarely used this feature in practice. --- The earbuds that come with it didn't stay in my ears well; I bought new ones. ---  --- Good things: --- I loved the fact that it had an FM radio and a voice recorder (the reasons that I bought it). --- It's easy to access the hard drive from any computer, without any software needed. --- The large storage capacity proved fully necessary. --- You can change playback modes with a single button press (shuffle versus ordered, all songs versus current folder only). ---  --- My basis for comparison:  I've also owned a Creative Zen Jukebox (which I liked a lot but which I sold because I wanted the FM radio and voice recorder on the iAudio) and, currently, a used fourth generation iPod, which has been working well so far except for some occasional quirks
1. Packaging was shabby. --- 2. The finishing was pathetic with threads hanging out. --- 3. The quality and feel of the cloth was the worst I have ever seen. --- 4. DONT be deceived by the pictures. --- 5. The end product is not worth a gift or personal use nor 25% of the actual cost
Xenosaga: Episode 1 took us in. Although the flaws in that game were many, the story was sufficiently entertaining and interesting to warrant the praise that was given to the game, and the clunky play mechanics. ---  --- Xenosaga: Episode 2 was awful. Plain and simple, it was awful. Any of the interesting cliff-hangers from episode 1 were either answered stupidly, or not at all. The game not only possessed a lackluster storyline, with extra characters introduced merely for confusion's sake, but I have NEVER seen a battle system more user-unfriendly, and more monotonous and clunky than that of episode 2. At times, I wanted to throw my PS2 against the wall, particularly when fighting the patriarch. A terrible game which seemed to kill the series... ---  --- ...until Episode 3, which is a throwback to simpler RPG fare, and works quite well. In Episode 3, the battles are actually interesting to fight (at least early on - I enjoy the use of the boost counter for once!). No more will you guess at whether Shion's attack is useful against enemy A, or whether you should switch to, say, chaos. Instead, characters are divided into three classes: attackers, defenders and supporters (healers). It's a pretty simple system, no? ---  --- Also, the story kicks back into high gear. I won't spoil anything, except to say that finally, the Testaments, which were alluded to in Episode 1 but completely ignored (other than tangential referral) in episode 2, have returned, and let's face it: Wilhelm is a much more compelling character than, say, a young Albedo. Finally, the wheels which began spinning in episode 1 come full circle. In fact, it seems as if episode 2 could have been skipped entirely, with no loss of continuity. There are numerous nods to Xenogears in this game, and by the way, the gear sequences are actually quite fun (the character battles in episode two were only trumped in boredom...by the gear battles). ---  --- In any case, Xenosaga 3 is a worthy addition to the library. It has flaws (again, it would be nice to have action sequences and movie sequences move more seamlessly, although it's infinitely better than episode 1 or 2), but it's a fun game
I wont buy this title until they release the original WIDESCREEN version
I own a black '02 Jetta TDI and am anal about maintenance, including the exterior. I'm always looking for the one wax product that best suits a black car, and have found some that work well. The NXT Gen Tech Wax isn't one of them. One requirement for me is a wax that doesn't leave a white residue to clean up and detail out. The NXT box clearly states that it leaves no white residue, but I'll attest to the fact that it certainly does. In that respect, it's no better than any other wax that leaves a residue. But the worst is the film it left on my car's finish. I waxed my car with NXT, then went on a 150 mi trip to visit relatives. I went in and spent some time with them, then we decided to go eat and take my car. The sun was shining, and as soon as I walked outside and looked at my car, I could immediately see a haze on the hood, top, and trunk lid. I did plenty of polishing after waxing, so it shouldn't have done that. I borrowed a towel and wiped it off, but it returned. When I got back home, I used alchol to remove the NXT, returned the NXT to the store, got some Eagle One Nanowax, rewaxed, and it's gorgeous....with no haze or swirl marks and absolutely no white residue. Good riddance to NXT
I have a 10 month old and a 3 1/2 yr old who both love this tunnel!!!!! 
I bought a Canon Powershot A70. They say your best camera is the one you use most, and man I use it. I'm a high schooler, so I dont have much money, but with the A70, I can attach this adapter (LA-DC52C) to my camera, and I can have more photographic freedom with lenses, for alot less money. YOU HAVE TO HAVE THIS ADAPTER FIRST. Then any lense which fits (most), can be used... GOOD IDEA CANON!!!
very nice flooring for the price. easy to put together. I use it as weight room flooring in an exercise area I have set up in my garage. If you are looking for aerobic room flooring, I would recommend buying the 20mm version
i love my Jotter.  I have had it for over three years.  It glides across the paper and leaves a strong signature. Love it
This is the best !!!  Best store,  best service, fast service, and great packageing.  I will shop there again and recomend it to everyone !
This camera was the best "little" camera I have ever owned. --- It is so amazing. --- It takes fantastic pictures and it is cheap
My 2.5 yr old son loves this puzzle.  I help him put it together and he just loves the challenge and the construction equipment.  I like how tough the pieces are- they have held up even when stepped on and chewed on by a baby.  Very nice
These freeze dried strawberries are fabulous.  I use them in everything from cold cereal to oatmeal and even as an ice cream topping.  Most recently, I've chopped them up and added them to a batch of Rice Krispy treats (receiving rave reviews in the process!)  They're also great to snack on plain.  They have a light, crisp texture but they are not crunchy and they absorb moisture immediately.  Although 8 ounces doesn't sound like much, you really get a very generous quantity of these lighter-than-air strawberries.  I recommend this item highly
I bought this for my 15 year old son for Christmas. He loves it and he's got me hooked. The game is everything they say and more! You will not be displeased if this is the genre of game that you like! The only accessory that we need is another gun which we have already ordered
 People actually gave this movie 5 stars! Are they for real? If you want a good shoot'em up action movie with lots of hip hop and blunt smoking then this movie is for you. It is fun to watch, but to say it is true to life is like saying cabin boy is politicaly thought provoking. It is a fantasy about how rappers wish there life styles really are. Their are so many Scar Face ripoffs it's offencive, and the conclusion is so weak it looks like they said "Okay, we don't have much film left, we gotta' rap this up real quick. DMX, find religion...and cut." Rent the movie, try to figure out what the hell the jamaican guy is saying, ignore the horrible acting of Naz, then return it. And when you review it please don't give it five stars, those are supposed to be for the cream of the crop, not just some "Phat movie you and some down ass playas' watched while moms was outta' da' house.
very clear,bright day, strong magnification quality seems to be good . very well priced at around $100.00.i will know more over the passage of time .my firstimpression is good mj schra
This keyboard folds out well and I liked the feel of the keys. ---  --- However, the IR connector needs to be in direct connection with the IR port in the PDA.  For the iPaq, this port is at the bottom of the handheld.  The 210 degree arm does not rotate to this area.  In order to have the proper connectivity, you have to turn the handheld on its side.  This then requires another software program download (not freeware that I can find) to rotate your screen to the landscape view, unless you can read sideways without getting a headache. ---  --- Before buying this product, check your handheld to see if your IR port is between 4-8 o'clock - if so, this may be a difficult keyboard to use
Great value - great taste for sports drink-fare.  This is the only drink I use these days on the trails.  Very easy on the system!  No bad after taste. The 4.5 lbs cans are an awesome value. 
This album is ridiculous.  I almost want to say part of SRV's soul is in this guy...he is that good.  Honestly I think this album rips apart his previous two.  My hope is that Jimmy, DT and APO will bring out a 4th release...as good as this album or better! ---  --- THIS IS ONE OF THOSE GREAT ALBUMS WHERE EVERY SONG IS GOOD. BUY IT. --- YOU LIKE SRV, BUY IT. ---  --- Double Trouble must have brought part of SRV back, because this album is just plain sweet
It is the finale, and we have all been waiting, the tornement ends with team togouro at defeat,this is a must get dvd...
I've always fondly remembered this movie. Bette Midler and Danny De Vito have perfect comic timing. :-D 
Fit snugly over the seats in my brand new 2007 Toyota Corolla S Model. Very comfortable material. Nice colors with black background. I love it
This VERY expensive cable is already in the package if you purchased the Forerunner 201.  You won't need this unless you somehow lost it.  Damn, it is expensive!  This is a cable for goodness sake
This is the second Suunto Vector watch i have owned. Only because the first one was lost. The only two draw backs of this watch is battery life and my band broke twice in two years. Seems to me they could offer a much longer life battery and a band that would hold up alot better. the battery lasts about 6 months only.For the price of this watch ($230) you think tehy could do alittle better. ---  ---  Other than that i love the watc
A great magazine filled with real world testimonials, expert advice, and everyday contributors.  Gearheads will enjoy the balanced product evaluations.  Frugalheads will enjoy advice on frugality. There are scheduled events and photo essays.  Part glamour shots promo - part hardcore dirt and sweat trail runner fanatic
I've tried all kinds of bibs, but nothing works better than Pampers Bibsters.  Right size, great pocket to catch crumbs, covers my 18 mth old, soaks up spills. I use them full time, not just on the road. 
This album gives me goosebumps.  I got it because of Eric Dolphy, but there is a lot more to listen to on this album than Eric Dolphy alone (though he's excellent as usual).  The inclusion of Booker Ervin gives the album the perfect texture, as his style in many ways contradicts that of Dolphy. Although the styles are different, they complement each other perfectly.  Mal Waldron is a great composer, and many of his most excellent ideas appear on this album.  The song "Thirteen" is a fine example...you'll just have to listen to it.  Everyone on this album smokes.  Get this...you wont regret it
The 1 star is for this 5 star CD box set being no longer available. Does anyone know why or if it will be reissued soon? I have the Highlights CD and the "Live at the Plugged Nickel" double LP - but not being able to buy this is disappointing and puzzling. ---  --- Thank you in advance for any help. ---  --- Scott K Fis
Never Be Sick Again offers a major breakthrough in medical thinking regarding health and disease.  I am a biochemist doing medical research at UCLA. A friend gave me this book to read, and I was very skeptical.  After reading it, I couldn't stop thinking about what it was saying.  I even lost sleep thinking about it.  After many weeks, I have come to a conclusion - the author is right.  There is only one disease and there are only two causes of disease - revolutionary!  Once you understand this simple concept, it changes everything.  If your mind is not closed to new ideas, the profound insights in this book will change your life for the better.  It will give you the power to both prevent and reverse almost all disease.  With this new understanding, from now on, I will approach my research in an entirely different way.   --- C.L
Nancy Drew: Last Train To Blue Moon Canyon (13) ---  --- -Before I Begin... --- My review will be spilt up into sections and have a in-depth look at that topic. If you hate reading medium/long reviews or just don't have the patience I would not continue reading, but if you want to learn the most about the product before you buy it you'll continue. ---  --- -Gameplay & Interface --- This is a point-and-click mystery, the arrows and hands are simple and easy to use. They also have made and improvement in the arrows since the last game. The hands manipulate items or add them to your Inventory(Toolbox). When playing the game you also have a panel at the bottom of the screen including a: Inventory(Depicted as a toolbox, which I think should be a backpack instead) a Camera Cell phone and a Journal, Help and a Menu Button (Other games have a Coin Purse when money is used in the game). The Main Menu is pretty simple. However, the loading and saving a game is a little clunky and you can't delete saved games. It also prompts you about your decision; it makes saving/rewriting games take more than one click. For this type of game the interface is perfect, but I'll knock off a star for the irritating save/load page. --- **** ---  --- -Plot --- A fairly used plot in this series, finding treasure. But Her Interactive made this treasure finding story a little more interesting. Jake Hurly, a miner and owner of a custom-built train, falls in love with a young French woman named Camille on the way to finding gold. Camille later dies, Jake possibly finds treasure but he is nowhere to be found and his now "haunted" train is found out in out in the Nevada desert with the engineer dead. Many years later, Lori Girard (Daddy's little fame seeking, rich girl) finds the train and puts it back into shape for a trip to Copper Gorge, Colorado. She invites infamous guests along on the train to find out what happened to Jake Hurley and where his mine is using the clues Jake left on the train. A pretty simple treasure story (This series often uses that story but in different ways) now turned into a intriguing mystery, good work Her Interactive. The game also has some side mysteries like Lori getting kidnapped and someone throwing an emergency brake(Both happen to be publicity stunts). But you find who did those things only minutes after each event happened. What I didn't like was there was not really a culprit because there was no crime committed. The very end is when a crime is attempted after you find out who the culprit is. The Jake Hurley part of the plot was fantastic but the sub-plot(s) weren't very exciting. --- **** ---  --- -Characters --- I loved the characters, but you couldn't really interact with them as much. Lori Girard was one of my favorite characters, I loved watching that dumb blonde trying to get publicity and how she always kept forgetting Nancy's name. Since Lori is the hostess she was probably the main character. Tino Baldcucci is a great character as well. He is a Private Investigator but all he really did to get such fame was being at the right place at the right time. He is as conceited as Lori, you'll probably interact with him a lot more than John Grey. John Grey is the first black male to be in this series, he is the host of Ghost Hunters, a cable show on the verge of cancellation about ghosts. He's a pretty good character but not a leading role unfortunately. Then there is Charleena Purcell a romance novelist introduced in Nancy Drew: Secret Of Shadow Ranch (10), who is nice and very smart. She is in the process of making her book that's on a deadline, who you'll find out used one of Lori's story ideas in her latest book without permission. I like her better now then when she was in ND 10, to bad she has no memory of that game.  And finally there is Frank & Joe Hardy. These teenage brothers work for American Teens Against Crime (ATAC) and who were invited because their dad was friends with Lori's dad. The boys were nice enough to invite Nancy along as well. I personally liked this addition to the game because you get to play as Frank as a short-order cook. They really don't have much to do with the case, they are just a good source of info. I am looking forward to playing as them more in Nancy Drew: Creature Of Kapu Cave (15). I really didn't like how there was not a lot of character interaction in this game. But when you did interact at times it was really fun. That's something to add to ND 16 and beyond. --- **** ---  --- -Setting & Graphics --- I love being on a train, the feel was so exciting. Seeing the scenery pass by in the windows were great. The cars were so detailed and beautiful. I think my favorite place in the train was the Projection Car. Later you stop at Copper Gorge, a little town in Colorado. There was the mysterious crypt and a Museum/Taffy Shop that was cheesy but enjoyable. The crypt was small and there wasn't much to do, but I mean in real life all you do in crypts is mourn. The graphics were great. Very realistic. Its amazing how much the graphics in this series keeps getting better and better. This was probably the most unique setting in the series. I personally love trains, boats and planes so this made me really happy. --- ***** ---  --- -Puzzles/Activities --- The puzzles were fairly easy. I liked how a lot of the puzzles were combined into one to find where Jake's mine is. What was disappointing was the repetition of the puzzles. There were about four or five pipe sets you had to connect which got a little annoying. You also had to retrieve a lot of items like gemstones, tools, duct tape, a pen and other stuff. I don't understand how they made finding the gemstones easier than playing an almost impossible game with Tino to get a simple pen. Some of the puzzles were unique, like Camille's doll sorting puzzle and her favorite dance step, playing "Camptown Races" on the piano, and using metal slugs in a mathematical way to open doors on a scale. But some of these activities needed no skill at all like combinations, a word search, and a two memory games. This game had variety but also repeated some puzzles as well which brought down its score. --- *** ---  --- -Ending --- Once you find out where Jake's Mine your sent off there to get a head start for a "treasure". You'd think that after all the puzzles you went through you would think finding the treasure in the mine would be somewhat harder than everything else. You open the entrance, memorize a couple things, follow some lizards and then use the info you memorized. Not that difficult if you are smart. Then you find the "treasure" and your so called "culprit". You wouldn't know this person is the culprit when he/she finds you in the mine and talks to you, but then he/she loses trust in you and you get caved in. Then you get out(I thought this was fun to do, felt like a roller coaster) to stop the "culprit". I liked the ending and what the treasure was but getting through and out of the mine was relatively easy. Although the culprit was kind of obvious, I liked what the culprit's plan or goal was. Overall it was good ending yet a little easier than I thought it should have been. --- **** ---  --- -Overall --- This was one of the better Nancy Drew games out there. Definitely one to add to your shelf. The flaws in this game don't affect the game that much as they could have if the setting was different. The plot was pretty good and most of the puzzles fit into it. I enjoyed this game a lot after I played it more than two times. I think any game needs to be played more than two times to get the full experience. Some parts of the game are really exciting compared to other parts. The repetition of some of the puzzles isn't too bad. This game is outstanding but there is never going to be the best Nancy Drew game. It really depends on your opinion. ---  --- Add all these up and divide by 6... --- 4 *'s (Gameplay & Interface) --- 4 *'s (Plot) --- 4 *'s (Characters) --- 5 *'s (Setting & Graphics) --- 3 *'s (Puzzles) --- 4 *'s (Ending) --- = 24 Stars Divide By 6 (Categories) = 4 Stars ---  --- Thanks for reading
City of the Dead can't really be called a zombie story.  It's really a cheesy action novel that just happens to have beings called zombies in it.  The zombie aren't really undead like in the Romero movies, but are corpses possessed by demons.   ---  --- I really didn't find any part of the novel scary and it doesn't seem like the author was trying to make it scary.  He seemed to take the route so many Hollywood scary flicks take and just tried to gross out his readers through descriptions of the decayed bodies of the demons.   ---  --- The action is clunky and not very exciting.  His hero's are constantly stopping to argue about things like how Jim's ex-wife raised their son while being hotly pursued by hundreds of demons.  There are too many parts that require suspension of disbelief: a military Humvee could never catch an Explorer SUV, the hero's escape a fire by climbing across a ladder to the neighbor's house with the demons somehow not noticing, they're being chased by dozen's of demon vehicles on the road but second's later after crashing they have somehow lost them.  And I have to ask why Keene included the descriptions of Necrophilia in the novel.   ---  --- In the end City of the Dead reads more like a cheesy Schwarzenegger/Stallone/Norris movie than a horror novel
We got this for our shower. Our son is now 2 and the only thing we've used is the nail clippers. Which I actually really like the shape of them cause they are a lot easier to hold then just the tiny clippers, especially if baby starts to squirm a little. I couldn't even tell you where the rest of it is. The spoon thing and dropper for the medicine is cheap and useless. Any baby medication you buy you'll get a dropper for which works way better. The bulb didn't work well at all, just keep the one you get in the hospital, those work best! And if my little guy was sick he didnt appreciate having to sit still while I tried to take his temp. I recomend a therma scan for that. Just a quick beep in the ear and your good to go. ---  --- So basicly, I would recommend to pass on this item and just get a pair of nail clippers.
I have white everlast boxing shoes & they are very comfortable & I thought these ones were the same. the difference is that the other ones have soft parts in it where the feet move when boxing.  ---  The black ones are uncomfortable in the back side where the division of the shoe is.  They don't move well.  ---  plus they charged almost $ 20. for shipping. so I ended up paying a lot for them.
The best sprouter I've found.  Does a great job of growing sprouts, but very overpriced for its cheap quailty and build.
Got my Chillow a few months ago and wish I had not waited so long! It is great! My own personal "thermostat" having gone haywire years ago, I have wished for something to help me sleep and be cool. This is it! First, it allows my husband to cuddle up next to me without my pushing him away cause he's so darn warm and I just can't take the extra heat. Second, I have wished for a firm pillow forever!! and have tried many different pillows and a great side benefit of the Chillow is that it makes my pillow really firm. It can be a bit too cold for a minute or two, but it evens out before long. For those of you who have that problem, you might consider doing what I did. I purchased a "Bedsack" quilted & zippered pillow cover. Put the pillow + the Chillow in that and then in a pillowcase and it's just perfect. Might also help the vinyl scent that some of you complain about. I will agree that the Chillow makes my pillow very heavy, but that is my only complaint. And I'm not carrying it around so the weight is really not an issue.  Other than that, I wish I had purchased one of these Chillows long ago. It is a menopausal woman's dream come true!
Budget Travel is a quite a neat colorful magazine and is loaded with exotic far-away landscapes that do what they are designed to and give one a lift into dreamland. I also like some, not all, of their articles which tend to be well prepared and nicely written. ---  --- However, at the same time, it does need better organization as compared with (Horrors)Conde Nast. ---  --- I am diverting a bit but you may as well know that accessing your web site is impossible - I cant access it!!
I am a product junkie and I never would have believed I could fit all my stuff in this bag, but I did!  This bag is amazing and takes up so much less space than the assorted bags I had been using!  I am getting one of these for each of my sisters..
This bench is a must have for outdoor sports. This is the second instabench we have bought as the other one wore out.  It is sturdy and can comfortably fit a coach along with many players on this bench.  The bench itself is a little heavy and bulky but portable enough to throw into the car and go.  The frame is made well.  There were only two issues that I had with the bench.  The first is that the plastic material on the bottom of the seat separated from the top seating material.  Second is the carrying case ripped after a few months of carrying it back and forth to the fields. The top sides ripped along with where the shoulder strap meets the material on the bag.     therefore the rate of 4 stars
I purchased these strings through the Amazon affilaite at TelsonUSA They are EXCELLENT strings that would cost three times as much in the music stores.
I ordered this for the "mocha" flavor but really cannot say that I found it.  I will say however that this does make a very nice smooth cup of coffee, so much so that although I ordered this for "after dinner" coffee, I have been making it for breakfast
This thing was such a waste.  It does not get cold enough to do anything.  It also won't stay flat against your face to give any soothing sensation to your eyes. Overpriced and worthless item
We have this up on the wall for our baby and use it as a diaper changing night light.  The luminosity is just right for changing baby but is not too blinding for sleepy eyes.   My 9-year daughter also loves to cycle through the phases before bedtime.  ---  --- The room has to be very bright for the night light to turn off automatically.  The remote is very handy and we liked the 3 viewing options. ---  --- We'll be getting this as gifts for our friends and their babies.
I don't know about the people who gave 1 or 2 star reviews but this product is the ONLY thing that saved my hair. I did everything from getting a curly perm to stripping the color. I used coconut oil, frequent trims, keratin treatments and NOTHING worked. My hair still kept breaking and splitting like clockwork. When I used the product, 3 treatments later and it's never been healthier. The product is very oily, so USE SPARINGLY when you use it as a gloss or leave in conditioner! ---  --- P.S. People with healthy, not-so-damaged, and normal hair do not need to use this stuff. Because if you do, you'll get silly comments from a tree-hugger that has nothing to do with the product. This product is only for heavy duty damage! By the way, the ONLY thing good from John Frieda is Frizz-Ease...
I was expecting much more from this flash, I already started looking for the better one. If I knew this was a closeout item I'd never buy it. It died on me with no indication, sent to canon fixed and returned with a big scratch on it. Now it does work but sometings wrong with recycle time even with brand new duracell batteries... --- Save money and buy 5XX series flash..
 GOOD SOUND AND COMFORTABLE FOR THE PRICE . LIKE THE FACT THAT THE CORD IS ON ONE SIDE AND DOES NOT GO AROUND YOU NECK 
When people talk about buddy-buddy films this one gets overlooked.This was a refreshing break from the Eastwood mold,stepping down from the Dirty Harry altar, to switch sides of the law or God(as a preacher).This has a loaded cast, Clint Eastwood, Jeff Bridges(Oscar nominee/robbed)to George Kennedy, as another evil meanie.The oddball teaming of Eastwood and Bridges seals the movie as an enjoyable romp, where cross-dressing,wearing disguises and other stuff plays second-hand to the relationship which is supposed to be mentor/rookie but becomes Laurel/Hardy too often.The story itself wanders off in various directions until it comes home with unexpected sadness, marking the arrival of the versatile Bridges.Like "Collateral," where Cruise lets Jamie Foxx run with the movie, Eastwood generously let Bridges vamp for effect. Such a free-wheelin' script has not hit the screen in a long while.
extra clips are neccessary!  --- the gun goes through ammo --- and the clip only holds about 45 rds
This is a typical (semi slapstick) Gaiday film. It is corny, well produced, and will please anyone who enjoys the upper crust of silly comedy. The subtitles are just fine. You do not have to understand any Russian to laugh at this movie. Buy it, and enjoy
The Uno's MIDI input did not work with my Roland A-37 MIDI controller keyboard, even after downloading the latest drivers.  Using Cakewalk (Home Studio 4 running on a Compaq V2000 laptop) to record and view the individual MIDI events, I could see that some of the note-off messages had been improperly decoded by the Uno as note C-zero.  This caused those notes to ring indefinitely and caused an ultra-low note to sound... very unpleasant and obviously unusable. ---  --- The MIDI output did work fine driving my Roland Fantom XR and Roland JV-1010 with no problems. ---  --- After reading another Uno & A-37 user's identical problem (on Amazon), I returned the Uno and purchased an Edirol(Roland) UA-25 audio/MIDI interface.  It works perfectly with all of my equipment including the A-37
It looks nice and the color of the phone looks better but it scrachted and broke easily. The shipping was fast and the price was right
Yum! Fond childhood memories and sweet almost guilty pleasure is created whenever I use this. It smells wonderful. Deliciously scented bubbles blossom on my mesh sponge. This shower gel cleans well without being harsh to sensitive skin. I don't like it as a shampoo as much. When I do use it to wash my hair, I'm sure to follow up with a conditioner. It's a delightful product and I'm pleased with my purchase
This watch is great. It recharges itself, self adjusts with the atomic clock, world time, auto lighting, etc... just to mention a few features. As this is from the G shock series, it is really sturdy and scratch/water/weather/heat/shock resistant! It has both the digital and the analog hand to view the time(whichever is convenient). This synchronizes with the atomic clock(time and the daylight savings) which means you need not adjust the time. Another interesting feature is that if you tilt your hand in the dark towards you then the watch lights up showing you the time! ---  --- There are a few cons. There is no seconds hand on it(but there is a digital second indicator). This watch is slightly heavy and huge. But after a few months you get adjusted to it. You need to go through the manual as there are so many features and you have only four buttons
This wallet is so big for passport and don`t fit my documents from Brazil. --- Maybe is good for another country`s document
Este CD es excelente! Se los recomiendo a todos los que les guste la musica buena. Robi es un gran poeta y filosofo
My new Shoe Wallet is even better than I expected!  It securely fastens to my running shoe; holds my key, emergency cash, and identification; and most importantly, serves as a safe place for my iPod Sport Sensor.  Best of all, my iPod works efficiently and accurately in the Shoe Wallet without my purchasing Nike-branded shoes. --- I'm a very happy consumer!
I love this cover because it is so comfy for the baby! I have had my boppy for almost a year now and I used it the whole time I nursed my baby. Love it
In this part of the world weather forecasts are either scarce or highly inaccurate.  So far this product has worked great.  Its forecasts are quite accurate so you can plan on taking an umbrella with you in the car if it predicts rain, or if you need to wear your bermudas to enjoy the sunshine.  I had an indoor/outdoor thermometer manufactured by radio shack, and this unit can actually read that outdoor sensor so the addition of the two sensors that come with this unit allowed me to know the temperature indoors and in my patio, garage and the kid's bedrooms
I'm sure there are those who'd wax philosophical over the subject of filters and how one brand is "much better" than another, but for my Canon EF-S 10-22mm on a 20D, I figure Canon would be fairly good at making a filter that they're willing to have branded "Canon." It fits fine, doesn't interfere with the lens hood, looks clear, seems to attenuate that nasty ultra-violet part of the light spectrum and perhaps best of all, protects the front element. What more would one want
This snack is superb in several ways.  First it is very good tasting.  The flavor is very much like a soft peanut butter cookie.  Nutritionally, it has quite a bit of protein, very very low in simple carbohydrates (or sugars) and is high in fiber.   ---  --- I carry these with me to work and eat one in the morning and one in the afternoon to help me keep away from junk foods and excessive caffeine.   ---  --- These would be excellent to carry with you on a hiking trip
The details are all fine if you don't know the middle east - but are not well researched and inconsistent.  I won't bore you with the list.   ---  --- All the big picture takeaway is that the middle east and big oil are a complicated business with many parties that have a big stake.  Tell us something new.   ---  --- The overall storyline does not have much else going for it - I was expecting more intrigue, a more synthesized story line.  A disappointment. 
My complaints about this stand: --- 1. By far the worst thing about this stand is it leans too far forward.  There's not enough counter-weight so a slight pull on the bike will cause the thing to tip.  If it wasn't for this, I might say, "well I guess it's alright for 79 dollars." --- 2. The clamp isn't strong enough to hold the bike securely.  If you clamp to seat-post for example it will rotate on the seat-post. --- 3. The thing that tightens the clamp is made of plastic.  I'm assuming it will break fairly quickly. --- 4. The rotator is made of plastic - I haven't tried rotating on the seat post where it would put any weight on the rotator, but I doubt it will hold it. --- In my opinion this product should not be sold.  If you just want to clean your bike on a stand, it's fine, but for anything that requires any force like taking the pedals or crank arms off, forget-about-it
NO TECHNICAL SUPPORT THAT'S WORTH ANYTHING!  PROGRAM DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY! VERY USER UNFRIENDLY! OTHERWISE I WISH I WOULD NOT HAVE PURCHASED IT! NEED SOMETHING THE AVERAGE COMPUTER NUT CAN USE EFFECTIVELY
I don't usually like these type of movies, but this is a can't miss...you'll laugh
The new age herbalist is a great book. It has a ton of different herbs and tells the uses of each one. They also warm you about anything dangerous  about all of the plants. Very useful book perfect for anyone from beginner  to advanced herbalist. I use this book all of the time
The writing was very disjointed in my opinion.  I had to read and re-read many sentences to figure out what the author was trying to say.  It was a struggle to read. No likeable characters.  I made it to the part where it was introduced that Madeline slept with the ex-husband and current wife.  Give me a break!  I moved on immediately.  Too many good books waiting for me to waste time on this absurd tale
Laptop Mag can be best described negatively: it's not a really serious computer magazine.  It's more or less like Consumer Guide, which is basically paid advertising.  This means you can't really trust the article here because you don't know if they are not written by unbiased writers.  In the end, I feel this is a waste of money.  Besides, you can get all the info for free on the web, from CNET or ZDNET, anyway
I called Nature Made and inquired about their procedures to test their product for mercury. Their Fish oil is USP tested for purity and potency. There isn't any "mercury-free" fish oil, however, NM contains only .01 mcg / g of mercury. Very low level and certainly not toxic. I'm keeping my bottle of it and will take it confidently. FYI: they have a great website that contains all this information
I used to use Mac's Glass lipgloss before Juicy Tubes were around. Any time the wind blew I had hair stuck to the incredibly sticky gloss which, as you know, is extremely unpleasant and annoying. Juicy tubes stays on, but doesn't have the overly-sticky feeling which is wonderful. ---  --- I don't wear much makeup and find Juicy Tubes to add that "something special" to a dewy face. I recommend Daiquiri or Berry Bold for the most natural looks. Daiquiri is more of a straightforward shine while Berry Bold gives you that red lipped childlike look we all used to have naturally. You will adore this gloss. I can't live without it
I've owned and discarded numerous chargers.  This one is great - the retractable wire is very convenient for storage and use.  It looks pretty fragile, but so far it's held up to pretty heavy use.  Many of the other chargers I've owned have also had problems keeping a consistent connection - no such problems with this one
I saw this movie when I was about 15 or 16 and that was a long time ago.  I ordered a copy through Amazon and when I watched it I remembered everything in the film especially Queenie hiding in the woods. I like this as it was directed by Charles Kaufman, brother of Lloyd Kaufman who made the Toxic Avenger. I give this film a rating of 5 stars and as it is a Troma Inc. release, this is one of the best Troma films I have seen
I picked up a 1 Oz tin of same brand for 14.99 in Dallas are
Long before the advent of the written word sacred knowledge was handed down through the generations via the vehicles of ritual, song and dance. I have come to believe that the 'old ways' were in many cases the superior mode of transmission. Mere words could never convey the multi-faceted beauty, wonder and awe that can be expressed in sacred song and dance. This point is made crystal clear in this exquisite production of 'Holo Mai Pele.' ---  --- 'Holo Mai Pele' is an exciting and exotic multi-media production that I found absoultely engrossing. The director seamlessly moves the viewer back and forth between the preparation of the event in the dance studio, the on-stage performance and beautiful film footage of the enchanting Hawaiian landscape. The on-stage performance is also greatly enhanced by a large screen behind the dancers showing footage of volcanic eruptions, lava flows and lush tropical rainforests. All of this is underscored by an intermitent narrative explaining the history of the hula and the mythological tale of the volcano Goddess Pele and her battle with her youngest sister Hi'iaka. The narrative is the perfect compliment to the production and in no way detracts the viewer from the performance. ---  --- This DVD serves as both a wonderful introduction to the novice in Hawaiiana and a much needed and revered document to the initiated providing a performance that attests to the power and immense beauty of the hula and its embodiment of the Hawaiian 'Spirit of Aloha.' Truly a sacred visual document to be treasured.
A recent reviewer noted that she had trouble finding information on skin rashes in this book. I had to post a review responding to her review because this book has tons of information on skin and scalp conditions in the table on pages 404-412, which talks about everything from impetigo to eczema. The information on teething is a bit more meager. I agree that this is something that the author needs to expand upon in the next edition of this book. But I still think this is an outstanding baby book. It provides tons of information and is reassuring and contains just the right amount of humor to keep you reading at a time in your life when it's hard to find the time or energy to read.
this product is great the only problem I have is that upon downloading the drivers for this item I get a warning from my server stating that this devise does not have an Id certificate and it advises me not to use this item for it may damage my computer. I want to use this item but I am afraid to please verify you certificate so I can complete my downloa
I like this humidifier alot but now I cannot find replacement filters for it. I only had it for about 3 months and now I cannot find replacement filters. This unit was not cheap either, it did cost money and now for it to basically be brand new and not to be able to find filters is really fustrating. I would not recommend this humidifier for this reason only
Fable has reached the point where all RPGs dream of going. It's absolutely the pinnacle of the Adventure criteria. The creators put you in the game, they make it fun, and they make it interesting. Fable is the game that absolutely defines the whole light side/dark side thing. Because no other game concentrates on the subtle, small, important details and leisures quite like Fable does. People will learn to adore you, and people will learn to fear you, you have a life, you're not just some dummy on a string being instructed on exactly what to do.  ---  --- You hear that? Fable is life. It's adventure. With a hint of unrealism, just to the point to make you eternally amused to never decease until the fat lady sings.  ---  --- Battle System: 9. It's not guns, it's not shoot'em up blowing their brains out. It's classic swordsplay and acrobatics, blocking, stabbing, leaping, lunging, ducking, dodging, running away, nothing to say except 'die'. Not to mention, you can eat pie. And it's all realistic, hitting someone in the back, the head, the torso, all cause different amounts of damage, there's decapitations if you're lucky. And the game even keeps track of your decapititations, how cool is that? There's archery, shoot someone with and arrow, the further you pull back your arrow, the more damage it does, but the less accurate it is. You see? Realism. Plain, clear and simple, just like the drive-thru guy ordered. ---  --- Leisure and life: 9. Flirt with chicks, flirt with guys. (Eww..) Flirt with chickens. Whatever. Flirt with anything with a face. Get a special haircut, facial hair, tatoos, some chicks find them attractive, some scary. Some may think you're Michael Jackson with a sword and get the heck away from you. Hey, that's life, right? One of the first games ever to allow you to get married to any woman, (or man) and actually have sexual intercourse with them. Yep, you heard me, sex. Don't get cought up on the kinkiness boys, it lasts for 5 seconds when the screen goes blank, it's only for crickets and giggles. Buy a house, rent out your house, live in your house, steal from anyone, kill anyone, picklock doors, fish, dig, kick chickens, abuse your wife, whatever you wanna do, you can probably do it in Fable.  ---  --- Main adventure: 10. Yes, this game is not all just chicken-kicking. There is a plot. Filled with with surprises, cliff-hangers, and ultimate rewards.  ---  --- Gameplay: 4. Quite possibly the only downside to this game. It's TOO EASY. I completed the game naked and didn't die once. There is no way to change your difficulty. This does, however, make the game much more fun as you don't have to reload and just get lucky in order to defeat an enemy. But in all sincerity, you may very well just whiz your way past this game in mere hours if you put your mind to it.  ---  --- But then again, that is why I am thankful for all the bonus material in the game, because the actual game itself can go by pretty fast.  ---  --- It may seem confusing and hard-to-get at first, but all RPGs do, so just stick with it.  --- 
I've always been a fan of Roger Moore's James Bond, but what I've discovered in recent years is that only a couple of his Bond movies were, like, actually good.  "The Spy Who Loved Me" is not one of them.  Oh, sure, it's fun -- almost ALL of the Bond flicks are fun -- but it's basically just a kid's movie, and that's not necessarily a good thing. ---  --- (1)  Stromberg is a lame villain.  Yes, his underwater lair is well-designed, but it's silly.  Not as silly as that ice palace in "Die Another Day," but pretty silly. --- (2)  Barbara Bach is one of the very worst Bond girls.  She's not an ugly woman, to be sure, but she was a terrible actress; she sounds like she's reading -- poorly -- from a cue card in ever single scene she's in. --- (3)  Jaws is a stupid character.  Having metal teeth wouldn't actually make you capable of biting through metal.  The metal you were biting would resist, and you'd end up just tearing up your gums.  I don't expect realism from 007 movies, but I also expect them to not be outright idiotic.  (That said, Jaws is effectively used, and Richard Kiel was excellent in the role.) --- (4)  The disco score is terrible.  TERRIBLE. --- (5)  The plot is nothing more than a rehash of "you Only Live Twice," but on the ocean rather than in space.  Certain elements of the big final shootout are even the same in both movies!  Embarrassing. ---  --- I love Bond, but this is not one of the highlights. ---  --- The DVD is good, with a couple of fine documentaries, but the commentary track grates, because the director and other commentators spend WAY too much time patting themselves on the back for the great job they supposedly did.  Even if that were true, it'd be annoying
The lens fulfilled all of our expectations as to quality of portraits and field of view flexibility. --- The stabilization aspect is a great help, although it doesn't compensate for someone pushing the shutter too fast in low light conditions. --- Highly recommend this lens as the standard use lens for the Canon Rebel XT
He's always been a Colts fan but with their Superbowl hype, this football couldn't have come at a better time.  Happy Birthday, D!    Can't offer anything but good reviews on the quality and look of the football
This is a fantastic product at an incredible price. I am amazed by the quality and the free shipping makes it even better. It has completely eliminated my lower back pain, the chiropractor never did that. Buy this table
We baught a bunch of these fish for our 8 year old.We have a inground pool and thought they would be lots of fun!! Okay we took them out of the package, and had to rearrange the batteries 82 times before it would even respond to the water!!! When we placed it in the pool all it did was go on its side,in circles. Nothing was "realistic" about these things!!!! I should add that it was not just this one, but all of them!!!Do not waste your money or time buying these!!
This book has a volume number - it is one of a series of monographs that have been published.  I am looking volume 231, but since you don't mention the volume number I don't know if this is the volume I'm seeking.  I will go elsewhere for my purchase
This is, without question, the WORST book ever written on one's financial life.  To begin with, it's useless: ZERO information, ZERO new analysis of old information, ZERO advice, ZERO interesting anecdotes.  Additionally, it's rambling--meandering from summaries of old data, to poorly written schmaltzy 'new age' feel-good blathering.  What exactly is this guy's point?   No way to tell.  --- Seriously, this book is SO BAD that all the people who allowed their names to be associated with blurbs on the cover have, in my opinion, lost all remaining credibility.   --- What a waste of my $16 and 4 hours.  --- I want my money and time back.
I would give this kit zero stars if I could. The instructions say that it takes 6-8 weeks for the seeds to sprout. I kept them in moist peat and warm temperatures for over three months after the recommended period of refrigeration.  Not a single seed sprouted. I finally had to throw out the whole kit when mold took over. Complete waste of time and money.  ---  --- But if you're feeling lucky, you should know that most of the seeds in this kit aren't much bigger than pinheads, and they all come packaged together in the same tiny plastic bag. So if you want to have each type of plant growing in a different section of the plastic tray provided in the kit - like that shown on the box cover - you need to separate out each seed under a strong magnifying glass.  And even then you won't be successful, as most of these seeds look just like ground pepper.  I accidentally spilled a few on the floor, and after sweeping them all up I literally couldn't tell them from the other debris in the dustpan.     ---  --- By the way, it takes a minimum of 6-8 years living in ideal growing conditions for any of the plants in this kit to reach the sizes shown on the box cover. These are NOT plants that can simply be put on a windowsill. They need an environment that is not easily provided in the average home - LOTS of very bright light (about 15 hours a day), LOTS of humidity, an acidic growth medium (such as sphagnum moss), and about 80 degrees. And even then, these are VERY slow-growing plants.  ---  --- To keep the humidity level high, you'll need some kind of terrarium, preferably covered to keep the humidity level high. But if you use incandescent bulbs to provide the necessary level of light, the amount of heat they produce can easily raise the temperature to lethal levels. For this reason I recommend a combination of fluorescent bulbs and a moist/dry heating pad at the bottom. Be sure that whatever heating pad you use isn't the type that shuts off automatically after one hour of use.  ---  --- Some warnings...  --- These plants flourish only in a very limited range of environments and nourishment.  The care you would normally give a houseplant will - in all likelihood - kill these plants: ---    NEVER feed them animal protein (like hamburger). The fats in meat aren't digestible and can kill them.  ---    NEVER use tap water to water them. The mineral build-up can kill them so use distilled water only.  ---    NEVER feed them insects that have been killed by insecticides, like RAID. Carnivorous plants should be fed soft-bodies insects like small slugs, ants, termites, etc., rather than hard-shelled insects such as beetles. Well-stocked pet stores will carry dried mealworms, but even these will need to be cut into very small pieces. Just as a baby needs tiny mouthfuls of food, so too do Venus flytraps.  ---    NEVER fertilize them. These are very slow-growing plants and any attempt to force them to grow will kill them. 
This watch is a good size, pretty comfortable, and nice looking for a sport watch. But resetting time or date, or figuring out how to turn off the alarm when you set it by mistake (when you were trying to figure out how to reset the time and date) is super frustrating. The buttons are impossible. I've had it with mine and will buy another product
The case does not fit and the battery is incorrect for --- the DX759
  I had to work with a pc and windows because of my profession......architect..  My firms have always used architectural desktop.  Unfortunately, it only is compatible with a pc.  NOW  !!  finally I purchased an exquisite iMac.. and when need be, I can run architectural desktop on it in windows to get a few things done..    Apple vs PC ? --- No comparison.... and my iMac is so sexy it makes me smile.. so kill me.  
Expensive, but I use it for aerobic and occasional high impact exercises as well as yoga. Very satisfied
Before purchasing this watch, you should go to a store and take a look. This watch is HUGE. The temperature feature works fine until you wear the watch, then because of your body temp. you have no idea what the temp. is. The barometer feature is displayed in millibars, not something I am acquainted with. I could not get the compass feature to work correctly. ---    It took approx. 3 weeks to be delivered ( free shipping ). I returned the "watch" and purchased a TIMEX, paid for shipping, and it was at my door in 4 days and works perfectly
This is such an good industrial album, that I was sitting and listening to it and all the adjectives that I wanted to use seemed not good enough. However, if I have to put one then it has to be these, brilliant, astounding, stupendous and awesome. This is probably one of the best industrial albums of all time. The first track is good and then it just gets better and better. In fact the first track is not as good as the other ones and could have been replaced with another track. The book-let is ok but the lyrics are missing, but still it is an important release since it showed that inudtrial bands are tallented muisicians and can sing. Minphaser, Life Line, Guna are some of the best made industrial tracks ever with the intricate layers of sounds, bets and samples. The keyboard sounds are constantly amazing and this is an album not to be missed if one likes industrial music
I loved the first Xenosaga. Then, this arrived. Episode 2 isen't a bad game in terms of the story, the intro is absolutely DYNAMITE. Then you get into a battle. Now, if you like tactical stuff, this is a good game for you. But if you're trying to fight your way through a hoard of enemies to get to a save point in record timing, I say save your money. Gone is the amazingly well-done battle system in the first episode. In its place stands a completely out-of-nowhere new way of battling that takes 15 minutes to get rid of a couple of easy enemies( the easy ones in this game have around 2000 Hps). Ridiculous, but that's not all. The enemies have weak "zones" that depend of the height of the attack that you input.The zones are A,B and C, A being the highest. Triangle=C, square=B and Circle=A -SOMETIMES-. See what I mean? It's completely screwed-up and you have to become deeply --- addicted to the game to understand its full potential. And if       that wasn't enough, they changed the voice actors too. Kos-Mos's  --- voice sounds more like an operator than a robot's and Momo sounds like a brat. At least, chaos' voice has improved. I'd prefer playing episode 1 twice than playing this. I just hope Namco comes out with a better sequel, otherwise spend your moey on something else (like Shadow Hearts, for example).    
I've been a subscriber for several years now.  I was trying to decide between maxim and stuff.  I chose maxim because the info is very random and entertaining (i.e. how to do doughnuts in your car, ect.)  They do have some photos of actors and such, but many were of people from other countries and just other pretty girls you may have never heard of... I would suggest this magazine
I got two of these for the front seats of my Toyota SUV. They are very cute, just like the picture, but the backgrounds are a jungly green, not black, which I expected from the picture. However, the green goes great with my interior, so I'm very pleased with these seat covers
Complete waste of money.  I purchased my copy at Wal-Mart but wanted to warn others before they made the same mistake I did.  The graphics and templates they use on the package to lure you in are nice and tasteful.  The actaul program is SO not like that.  The graphics are down right cheesy, and low budget.  Having only paid $9 for this program, I feel like I was completely ripped off.  I'll for sure be calling the company and asking for a refund. 1 star seems like too many to give this awful item
I bought this product because it has two most important things I am looking for: portable and the splash guard.  My son feels very comfortable with it that he has been using this since last August when we got it.  The parts are all plastic for easy cleaning. The cushion part of the seat and the the splash guard are all one piece, unlike some other potty seat where the splash guard is an attachment.  So that's very easy to clean.  The entire potty can be disembled to be cleaned and sanitized from inside out, no hard to reach spots.  The seat is soft and contoured with oval opening which is best, unlike a lot of potty I found with a circular small opening.  The seat can be put on adult toilet seat which I started training my son after several use to avoid cleaning the bowl.  The only thing I wish is that this product comes in just the seat without the bowl, then that would be even better!  
I discovered this album some years ago as i'm workin' in big music stores i've got the opportunity to listen to so much music....well!! this album is a very difficoult one to find in a record store nowdays, and every time i have it in stock i play it straight away and some customer who listen to it buy it instantly,Blakey and Potato are swingin' so much in those "salsa like" rithms Mobley is -as usual with Art Blakey and K.D.- in such a great shape givin' a wonderfull touch to evry note he plays,basically one of greatest Blue Note of all time!
I was (and still am) a huge fan of "Mr. Show".  It was the only reason I kept my HBO subscription.  It's hard for me to believe that the same talent that created "Mr. Show" produced this weak offering.  Might be the least funny comedy CD I've ever heard.  Virtually all the material in the album has been done before, and much better, by other comedians.  Most of the bits just lay there and die.  Mr. Cross seems to realize this and tries to make up for it by saying f*ck a lot.  Sorry, it just doesn't work.   ---  --- Don't waste you money on this one.  Get the "Mr. Show" DVDs instead and forget this ever existed.   
This is a very nice watch. The pink mother-of-pearl face is lovely to look at and the leather strap is very soft. The date is a little small but the watch is so nice that I didn't even care. The only complaint I have is that Amazon sent me this watch with a dead battery inside. I had to get a new battery on my own, but as soon as I told Amazon, they credited me the $10. That was great, but they should have sent me a watch in working condition. Otherwise, the watch is highly recommended. Even nicer than in the photo
this was the first digital camera i purchased. i am an adventurous person and  wanted something that would stand up to my lifestyle. this camera wasn't it.  ---  --- the good ---  --- *it is compact, which is pretty convenient ---  --- *it has several camera functions that have the potential to work well if you are techno-savvy.  ---  --- the bad ---  --- *after snorkeling with it for 30 minutes, the camera leaked and broke. olympus replaced it, but only after my 2 month stay in costa rica was over.  ---  --- *the functions are unreliable and difficult to use. rarely if ever do i get them to work how i want. the pictures always need touched up afterwards, sometimes seriously. ---  --- *the zoom sucks. don't expect to get those awesome close ups they advertise unless you have some serious patience. ---  --- *the image stabilization is a joke. you need a tripod or surgeons hands to take pictures that aren't blurry.  ---  --- *the user manual left me with a lot of questions
We bought two pairs of these (his and hers - sizes Large and Regular) direct from the manufacturer. The gloves in both sets were of different sizes, and workmanship on everything was poor and clearly would not stand up to regular use. Too bad, because the concept is great.
very very not user friendly.... no instruction to install. worked after it got installed but doesnt work with the wireless internet in my house. Decided to resell it. could be its only because i'm apple-illeterate...
I would have to say that out of the countless bands i have heard over the past few years Into Eternity is one of the best and has one solid album here!! I think they have something a lot of bands do not have and the one cool thing about them is Tim Roth seems to give a real crud about his fans as he does guitar videos on his website to show you how you can break down his guitar riffs and that to me as a guitarist is so helpful (ive learned some of their songs this way) and this shows how he is not afraid to be the nicest guy and actually take that kind of time to be close and original to his fans.you just never see that these days. And the rest of this band has so much talent, Stu can scream like halford growl too and has a high vocal range and it makes them sound interesting. Plus jims drum work, how can anyone say this dude isnt one of the better drummers, he is so tight but can slow it down and tempo change very well. This album plain rocks,  It should be known as these guys were on Gigantour and rocked there too. Be cool if them and annihilator went on tour.  I have become very fond of them and hope they stick around and keep making great albums in a world overflowing with the same ole un-original bands that all sound the same!
This will be short.  It is worth the price of this album just to hear the Branford and Harry Connick Jr. duet Carolina Shout.  That being said, all of the other tracks on this album are excellent. From Jungle Blues to Doug Wamble's solo guitar on Autumn Lamp, with this record you get a pile of blues and at the same time gain an appreciation for Romare Breaden's art.  A must have.  Branford keeps outdoing himself
Being a Starsky and Hutch fan since I was a kid, I was looking forward to playing this. The graphics are "cartoon" horrible and the need for "VR" points becomes annoying after awhile. The bad guys are like something from a Chinese Kung Fu movie, you can shoot at them accurately and it takes all day to kill them...and that's with playing with a PS2 gun (I can't imagine shooting with a controller) which makes you lose the mission because you are down on "VR" points. The dialog gets annoying too and you can't skip hearing it either
I was hoping that "Socermania" would be on the "Extreme Sports Fun" DVD but NO! Instead disney had to put on all of the same cartoons that were released on the "Disney Treasures" this also goes for the other two DVD's Extreme Music and adventure fun, allthough 'Pluto's Blue Note', 'Donald's Dilemma' 'No Sail' 'Old Sequoia' and 'Trailer Horn' are on DVD for the first time but with the new Disney Treasures "Disney Rarities" and "The Chronological Donald volume 2"(which might I add could use a lot of improvment on the restoration) who needs these DVDs, so I suggest not to buy these cheap DVD's and buy the Treasures in spite of the bad restoration
Highly recommended!!!! My wife uses this pack for nursing school.  As you can imagine she carries A LOT OF "STUFF".  This pack makes it a lot lighter on the shoulders than a normal pack would because of the padding in the straps.  I would recommend this to anyone who is a student and is looking for a durable pack for school
Quite disappointing if you are expecting a film true to the book. Hopefully they will remake the movie soon, because the technical capabilities back in 1966 did not do the novel any justice
This is the original version of this film with David Niven, Peter Sellers, Woody Allen and other very familiar faces.  The film is nothing at all like the 2006 version which was very good.  But Ian Fleming intended his 007 to be a non-serious serious agent.  Excellent film and I heartily recommend it.  My 20-something grandson is a 007 fan and he really liked this movie; had to have the DVD after seeing it on TV
OH YEAH! This is the film which set the standard for the women-in-prison genre. The Big Doll House has everything you could possibly need if you are WIP junkie: cat fights (one even takes place in the mud), group showers, sadistic guards, scantically clothed gun toting babes, lesbianism, torture, and Pam Grier. OH YEAH!
This is a great idea for a product! For those of you who don't wash your hair every day, this is a great way to keep it looking and smelling fresh on days you don't wash it. I used this after 5 days without washing, and while it might have worked better within 3 or 4 days, it still freshened my hair and made it beautiful! Well done
This soap washed really well, but after I rinsed it off, it felt like my skin had a soapy film over it. It also made my skin feel "stipped". I did not really like this soap and instead recommend Basis facial products instead
I love the look of this watch!  I have enjoyed it for almost two weeks now and it has kept perfect time to date. ---  --- Originally I was attracted to the Seiko SKX173 which I came across first.  However I was concerned that the physical size of the Seiko might be too large for my wrist plus reviews indicated its automatic/mechanical movement might not be as accurate as I wanted.  ---  --- Later I found this Citizen watch which looks virtually identical, yet it is smaller (diameter 38mm vs 43, height 10.5mm vs 13.5), and has a more accurate battery-driven quartz movement. ---  --- It also has a longer warranty (5 years vs 3) which probably indicates that the movement is more likely to be trouble-free than the self-winding Seiko. ---  --- The only negative I have encountered is that it (as well as the Seiko) come with a fairly bulky rubber strap.  While this is more comfortable than I expected, it does tend to interfere somewhat with the drape of the cuff when wearing a long sleeve shirt.
Santa brought this for my 5 year old daughter for Christmas and she loves it.  She takes it in the car with her with her baby doll and belts it in with the seat belt.  One of the things I love about it is it isn't too heavy for her to carry.  She can carry it with her baby doll in it without any trouble.  It is also very sturdy.  She has even sat in it herself and it didn't break.  I would recommend this doll carrier.  It is great for little people who enjoy pretending to be mommy and daddy
Well made tool.  Can seem to be a bit heavy.  Cleans well.  It was shipped lazer fast
If you don't tend to care about writing, then this would be the magazine for you.  Save your pennies and indulge on something else maybe
My little guy loved this from the start.  This is a versatile toy that lasted many months.  The mat is machine washable, so it became our take along for travel.  The hanging toys are on rings that detach so you can rearrange them for variety and take them anywhere, such as on the car seat or stroller as baby grows.  He's now 2 yrs, and the mat is still a wall hanging in his room!  This was a great investment
Poor construction, software that is difficult to install, unable to run when installed, and requires you to purchase a license to get a working copy.  Buy something else that actually works
Let's just be honest: this film is terrible . . . and not in the way that "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!" is so "terrible" that it's great . . . more like the way "Caddyshack II" is so terrible that the director should forever live in shame . . . ---  --- I was a kid when this film was released. And, while it was not particularly exciting then, it is insanely tedious now. It is a genuine test of patience . . . but with no pay-off what-so-ever. ---  --- Here's some potentially helpful information: ---  --- The slasher film can branch in two directions: supernatural (Friday the 13th II, Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street etc...) and crime/revenge (I Spit on Your Grave, Friday the 13th, TCM, Scream, Urban Legend ect...). This one falls under the latter heading. And while realism can render a more potent effect ("This could really happen!"), this film simply fails to engage the viewer ON ANY LEVEL. ---  --- The goal of a slasher film is two-fold: to horrify and repulse. This does neither!! The "horror" element is non-existent: there is no point in expounding, since there is nothing to examine.  And, if you love gore (and who doesn't?) try another film. The "murders" are barely visible (literally) and so sloppy that they solicit no response other than a yawn. Many of the film's problems are technical: the cinematography is just horrendous. The entirely film is extremely underlit, the colors are needlessly washed-out, and the film stock is grade "F." And this, as you know, is not because the film is over twenty-five years old . . . the problem was always there. ---  --- There is ONE "good" moment in the entire film . . . when the school's "bad boy" has his head lopped-off and it clumsily thunks down the prom-court walk-way. Still, it is more comic-relief than genuine horror. ---  --- The soundtrack could not BE WORSE. I am not referring to the disco tunes (we accept those since this film was made at the end of the disco period), but the tracks made for the film . . . they sound like they were squeaked-out by The Carpenters. So, imagine lots of disco punctuated by lackluster, psuedo-thoughtful ballads (like the final song on the track). Words cannot explain how wildly offensive it is!! ---  --- Did I mention that Leslie Nielson has a meaty role (yes, THAT Leslie Nielsen from Airplane, and Naked Gun)? He plays a tough-minded principal who is tormented by the death of his daughter. I know, it SOUNDS funny, but IT'S NOT!! Trust me!! ---  --- If you dig watching unattractive teenagers "disco the night away," hey, this film is totally for you!! But if you are looking for a decent slasher film from the early middle-period of its reign look elsewhere (like Halloween, Friday the 13th etc...) ---  --- I'd be willing to get all Ed McMahon's Star-Search on you and give this "film" a 1/4 star. But it is an important milestone in the slasher sub-genre (I will not spoil the film and tell you why, though). So if you are a slasher enthusiast or a horror scholar, watch it . . . on picture-in-picture . . . maybe after a few drinks . . . on a day when the cable is out . . . on fast-forward!
I am so happy with this purchase.  The order was shipped promptly and even included free samples of tea bags.  The box is beautiful and the tea selection is excellent.  Highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a great gift
This was an excellent sophomore season for a great series
These are my single favorite pair of underwear. Not your typical jock but much more comfortable and stylish. I'm in the military so at first I thought "thongs are not for "real men" but after wearing these I found they are, and a lot more guys wear thongs and jocks than you realize. I wear these for every day activivties, sports, work, and leisure. There isn't much fabric so they're great under jeans and my girlfriend thinks there sooo sexy. After wearing them for a while it's like nothing is there because they support you only where you need it. If you've never owned a thong, I think you should give these a shot.I definately recomend the 2xist Y back thong
I am totally satisfied with the merchant and the product
My son wanted this piece and we have enough of the other pieces to incorpate it into the track system we have started and my son loves it and plays with it so I have to say it has exceeded my expectation for the value it added to our GEO Trax railroad
On the front of the box it says it can be used for Professional photo editing and has 20,000 Professionally Designed Projects, when I received the box it had a disclaimer that the photos cannot be used for products for re-sale, I purchased this product to do a work at home video and spent all morning evaluating the different software's and now I find out it is totally worthless to me. I went to there website and it says allow 4-6 weeks for a refund! I am going to turn them into the FTC for false advertisement
we bought this thinking the suctions would keep the darn thing on - boy were we wrong!  the suction cups are so weak that my cat jumped onto the toilet seat and knocked it over.  save your money
This book was written in 1982, updated in 1995. It has a whole section on cameras, which isn't useful since most of them are outdated. Doesn't even mention digital cameras. Since it specifically discusses the mechanics of cameras, I found this book to be disappointing.
This is basically a commercial pitch for Dr. Murad's spas and products. Unless you are planning on buying his regime, he gives very, very scant information about how you could accomplish the program using other, less expensive products.  --- Don't expect an easy how-to giving you day by day advice of supplements and skin care. It's not here. I decided to buy this based on other's good reviews. Now I'm thinking that they were written by employees. I was very disappointed
I was looking for an inexpensive but functional leather briefcase and this was exactly what I was looking for.  I have more than three electronic devices that I need easy access to - and the case has three outside pockets big enough to hold my devices.  The only thing missing is an outside place to put a pen or pencil.  I don't know how durable it will be, but I'm hoping, very!! ---  --- For the price, this is a good buy
Love the shirt!  This was a birthday present for my son.  We are so impressed with the quality that we will definitely use this Amazon site again
I bought thes earrings(and pendant)for myself. They are absolutely beautiful, they have so much shine and sparkle to them. Everyone keeps asking me where i got them, i'm reluctant to tell but I do. :-
I have returned this item to Amazon; I paid $43.99 when they had it in stock. The audio out on this dock is a stereo mini (1/8") jack, the connection is terrible from then getgo, with low volume, distortion, and noise when the jack is jiggled. ---  --- I would highly recommend the dock they're currently selling at Radio Shack for $29.99. It has RCA outputs on the back and excellent sound quality, it charges, and the remote has a menu button
This is the best value you can get. Awesome picture with 10,000:1 Contrast Ratio. My XBOX 360 looks amazing with 1080i resolution. Definitely worth the money. You would not be disappointed with this TV.
I have been searching on line and elsewhere for a good camcorder as 1) a replacement for my JVC GR-D70U, which died, and 2) to go online with a video blog.  After much study and evaluation, I chose the Canon ZR800 based on a salesman's recommendation, frustration as to the number of choices which are available, and the presence of an external microphone jack (which was one of my "must-have" options).  After returning home, I read the review by Miamian "New Reviewer", and felt trepidation.  After charging the battery, I tried the camera.  Lo and behold, Miamian is right.  There is an obvious noise when recording, which was not present in my JVC.  Hoping against hope, I played the tape back, and, just as I feared, the tape had a pronounced hiss.  This is not just tape hiss, but a much more pronounced noise, which transfers to the TV when watching.  It rendered the camcorder totally unacceptable. I took the camcorder back, and, like Miamian, ordered the Sony DCH-HC38.  (I know, it doesn't have an external microphone jack, but after all this confusion, I give up!! Why don't they make more cameras with them??) ---  --- The plus signs of this camera are that its menu is much more intuitively laid out, and selection of the desired item does not even require looking at the instruction book.  The joystick selector is so easy to use, to select play, rewind, fast forward, stop, pause in the playback mode,  and is also is used to select various menu items in other modes.  The wide screen viewfinder (LCD) is so nice to use, and easy to see, all others (in 4:3) become passe'. ---  --- I didn't have any chance to evaluate other aspects of the camera, due to the unacceptable noise which demanded rejection of the unit.  The picture looked OK; it did not greatly impress me, however, and the automatic focus appeared to be slow and very noticeable in playback. ---  --- In essence, caveat emptor; especially if you're hard of hearing.  Others watching and listening to the tape will not be
This is completely junk.  Don't buy it.  It colapsed in a 5 mph wind (with out the sides attached)
For starters I love Bun B and Pimp C and UGK and all that but the thing that kills it is Lil Jon yelling "gansta grizzel" like 10 times in every track. I love lil Jon too, but they coulda done without it. also they just rappin over other peps beats, it just sounds like a mixed tape kinda deal. but heard rumor that bun b is bout to come out with an offical bun b record, not a mixed tape, or nothin like that, but only reason why i gave it two stars is just cuz they got tight flows on the tracks, but not their own beats, and lil jon coulda just shut the hell up on those tracks. just keepin it real. i wouldnt spend the money, id just wait for bun b to release his own offical cd, or till pimp c get out and ugk hooks it back up
I thought these wipes would be a handy solution for the office or situations where I don't want to carry around a bottle and a microfiber cloth.  But contrary to what's promised on the package the wipes left big watermarks on lenses, which ended up dirtier than they started. ---  --- The wipes work okay on a computer screen, though
I've found the BEFSX41 (v2.0) to be very problematic.  With firmware version 1.50.18, some distributed network software such as bittorrent will cause the router to reboot itself every 5 minutes, bringing down the entire net.  With the newer firmware version 1.52.10 it fixes this problem, but within a day starts to block or deny connections to our web server (passthru tcp port 80), making the router totally unusable.  Tech support was friendly and helpful, and the only solution they could come up with was to rollback the firmware to 1.50.18 for our websites, and upgrade each time to 1.52.10 whenever we had the need for distributed networking.  So now we upgrade/downgrade the firmware sometimes several times in a single week, and each time we do it brings down our net. ---  --- I've also found that some of the setup options are restrictive compared to other brands.  You cannot assign a static ip to a local computer by specifying its MAC address.  Instead you need to set the ip of the computer manually and this makes things very difficult for our laptops that need static ips.  Also, it appears that you cannot map two different external ports to the same internal port number, even though they map to two different computers.  This makes it impossible, for example, to allow remote desktop access to two different local computers at the same time
I only have the basic and its good but i've seen this and it has to be the #&@*ing koolest thing you can have right now. I highly recommened it for begginers to experts
I purchased this pair of earrings for my 5 year-old granddaughter to wear as the flower girl in my niece's wedding.  When the purchase arrived, they were too small for my granddaughter.  Therefore I had to return them
As an asthmatic with a sulfa allergy, I thought I was limited to naturally dried fruits, which are tasty, but not aesthetically appealing. I'd been looking for some way of getting my fix for dried fruit without running the risk of (at worst) a trip to the emergency room. ---  --- I'd found a number of other freeze-dried fruits, but most of them had sugar added, something I try to avoid. I ordered this product (Orchard blend) with the hope that it would be flavorful. Wow, was it! ---  --- Aside from being good as a quick snack for when my blood sugar starts to drop, it's also fantastic when mixed with plain oatmeal to give it a little something more. ---  --- I'm extremely pleased with this product and I would recommend it to anyone that has been avoiding dried fruits because of a sulfa sensitivity or allergy
I tried this on the day I got it to see how it felt.  The velcro is so strong that when I tried to take it off, the velcro ripped the top layer of the material right off.  I would not advise buying this.  I was dissappointed in the quality of this product.
Bike lock manufacturer Kryptonite recently revealed that tubular cylinder locks -- which this model uses -- can be very easily picked. Kinda defeats the purpose of owning this in the first place.
Just purchased this for my 7 year old son that has cerebral palsey- He only has use of his right hand- this cartridge is perfect- game does not allow mistakes and can play this cartridge with only one hand and not both. Since my son has use of only one hand he has trouble playing the other vsmile games- he's hooked. Is very engaging also where some of the other games fall short
This is a nice tea.  Not bitter, I don't need any honey or sweetner at all.  I'll be getting more of this for sure
My husband likes watches and is a bit of a geek, so this was the perfect Christmas gift for him.  I was a little bit apprehensive when I recieved it but it works just like it should.  It is not apparent from the discription, but this watch does have the date feature.  I couldn't have gotten him a better gift for the price, he wears it every day
I have owned one for the past 4 years (haven't turned it off since the day I bought it) and it's still projecting strong as ever.  I bought one for my friend for Christmas also and he loves it just as much as I do
I really can't understand why all the reviewers are going crazy over this record. First off, I bought it without hearing anything by them before, but it had been highly recomended to people who like Tool and Mars Volta by Amazon!! They couln't have been any more wrong. So, why did i personally find this so painfull? --- Well, the whole thing in general is quite painfull. First off, the musicians. The whole band sound like studio musicians. No obvious indivuality or anything new to offer. Then we get to the vocals. The closest thing I can compare them to are Alison Moyet or Anthony and the johnsons. I don't mind Anthony and the Johnsons, but this guys vocals and the music just don't rock. Which is fine. It's ok not to rock! But why the hell, being a Tool fan and Mars volta fan, was I recomended this? It's bland, it's week, and the dubby bass, boring guitar playing/sound... weak vocals.. Actually, forget it. The whole package. It is just lame
These dolls rock! I love Nona. She's really cool! I also love Tess. She rocks! If you put them together, they're double cool
the taste is not bad. u can drink 2 glasses and not get sick of it. i gained 5 pounds in the first week of using it. i went from 140 to 145 using n-large 2, eating a lot, and working out.
these gloves are pretty good gloves, if you're wanting to get started in boxing or working out with heavy bags this is the way to go. they are very traditional yet slip on design
Great product.  Son enjoys being in the chair.  He especially likes the toys that attach to the side of the tray.  Only thing I don't like is it is difficult to clean in the creases of the seat cushion
I bought this DVD because I was getting sick of the other DVD's that claim to be pilates workouts. This pilates work out is very imformative and very beneficial. I am actually seeing results from this workout after only 3 weeks.  Karen also keeps you motivated to continue.  Not to mention the benefit of getting two 50 minute workouts for the price of one. Beware that you need a resist-a-ring for one of the workouts though, and those can be difficult to find. Great, great workout and I would recommend it to anyone
  I got this as a gift for my neece, she loves it, her parents love it too. She is now three years old, She got it last yr. for Christmas,...I was over to see her yesterday, and it still is like new. The velcro is very strong.. and it's a very safe toy.. Her baby brother, now is playing with it too, he is one yr. I recommend to all! Great buy.
This a great priced cd, but the content is why it is so cheap. It's a true-amateur album. Beethoven Lover is over her/his head. This is the real world, not a fantasy-everyone-likes-every-type-of-music world. Deal with it and agree with me. It isn't so great
The LCD is easier to use than the earlier version that relied on audio clips to switch frequency. You may have to experiment a good deal to find a position where the signal reaches the car radio adequately, like the 1960s rabbit ears tv antennas. Even then, if you are in an are with good FM radio coverage it's going to be hard to find a frequency where this will work. Mostly you can't use this with a cover on and you'll need a car charger if you want to use it for long. The all-in-one modulator and charger that clips to the docking connector is a better solution
one of mikio naruse's last masterpieces was 1960's "when a woman ascends the stairs" - it is also one of only two of the great director's films currently available in any video format in the u.s. but wow, what an introduction it is! this seemingly modest film about a woman on the edge of a precipice, winding her way through dismal back alleys and cheap bars in search of an out is one of the great character pieces in world cinema. crisply shot in black and white widescreen (which is admirably reproduced in this edition), this beautifully directed and acted film is an absolute must for anyone interested in movies. the sadness lies in the knowledge that this kind of film is not made anymore; there's no one talented enough to pull it off nearly as well. class and subtlety are a rare commodity and this film has just the right amount of both. it's perfect, one of the greatest films of all time, one i come back to again and again
Don't be fooled by the enticing 6 megpixels that this camera offers.  I'd been waiting along time to upgrade from my 3 MP Nikon Coolpix SQ as the prices of the higer resolution cameras continued to drop.  What've I've discovered, however, is that there is so much sensor noise in the full resolution 6 MP images from this HP camera that the additional resolution is worthless.  The images look absolutely horrible.  My little Nikon SQ with it's lower resolution produces much sharper pictures at every image size.  Do your homework and make sure that the sensor in the camera you're buying is a good one
This software is completely useless with an explorist gps unit.  I am sending the gps i just purchased, along with this software, back to amazon.  The software will not communicate with the gps, and the company will not respond to any of my support requests, the web page has none of the patches that are supposed to be available, and the live technical support is a complete joke.  After 20 minutes of being on hold, I spoke with a gentleman that barely spoke english, and offered me no help... I knew more about the software than him, and i've only owned it 3 days.  I'll never purchase from Magellan again
Really, folks, spend the money on a gym membership, go outside and play with your dog, play soccer with your kids, or spend time in the afternoons working in the yard or the house after warming up with slow movements and a power walk.  Be reasonable.  Just remain aware of how your body feels, know your limits (i.e. knees, back, elbows) and don't over do it!  It takes time to find your own approach to weight/figure management.  You can do it your own way.  You don't need this thing AT ALL.     ---  --- This product will NOT bring you any satisfaction.  you'll only feel stupid for getting sucked into the infomercial and wasting time when you could've been watching Saturday morning cartoons!!! ---  --- In the infomercial it shows you "all the machines" you have to use at the gym.  Well, there's a reason people use them- becuase their tried and true.  Those machines, well worth the cost of a membership, guide the user in producing precision movements.  THey cost thousands of dollars and are built to be absolutely sturdy.  You're better off using machines at the gym(hey, don't forget the YMCA), varying your cardio between outdoor and indoor exercise, and throwing in consistant measures of Pilates and Yoga, if you want to "change your body." ---  --- This is just another stupid product, we've seen them come and go for years.  It won't be around long, folks... ---  --- Disappoint will occur, and the probabilty that injury will occur is well within the realm of possibility. ---  ---  ---  ---  --- 
I had high hopes for this game, but played it with a friend last night and was appalled at the number of confusing questions and just plain incorrect answers.  For example, one question asks, "Which of these animals is not found exclusively in South America:  (a) chinchilla, (b) sloth, (c) guinea pig, (d) spring buck".  Ruling out zoos, my friend reasoned that since zillions of kids in the US have pet guinea pigs, the answer must be C.  Alas, no; the correct answer is "(d) spring buck" with no explanation.  Did they mean animals in their natural habitat?  We aren't sure.  The question is not clearly written.  Another question asks, "The word `berserk' is derived from:  (a) a Norse god; (b) the German for `crazy life', (c) a tropical plant".  I read this to my friend and said, "None of these is the right answer."  The word `berserk' comes from the Germanic branch of the language tree and means `bear-shirt'.  The game says the correct answer is "a Norse god.  In Norse mythology, the god `Berserker' always fought in a state of frenzy."  There is no such Norse god.  Who wrote these questions?  One of the aspects of trivia games that I enjoy is the prospect of learning something in the process of playing; this game concerns me because I do not know which answers are incorrect.  From a learning standpoint, the badly written questions and poorly researched answers make this a frustrating and intellectually dangerous game. 
Yes, T&C is the oldest continually published magazine in the USA, and it's their 160th anniversary. However, I see little reason to celebrate.  Why? Because I fail to see how it's really improved over the years.  ---  --- Nowadays, this magazine seems to cater far too much to the material lusts of the "nouveau riche". Back in the day when it was a true "high society" magazine, there were rather interesting and educational articles on the arts, literature and culture. It was beautiful and it really gave a person something to aspire to, but now just like so much of the rest of society has mutated into a lot of pretentious materialist wannabees bragging about "bling bling", so has this magazine.   ---  --- There are far too many adverts for so-called "luxury goods" for my tastes, and although they put in a patronizing article about women over age 60 being the new "power" base, they insist on using only THIN 20-something models who probably can't afford the clothes they are modeling! ---  --- Articles wise, they are starting to sound more like Glamour or Cosmo than the erudite publication I used to enjoy buying on the newsstands 20 years ago.  ---  --- Yes, T&C has changed with the times...but these are not good times if that is the case. It's too bad
I have many robot books and this is the best and most informative book of all. It is easy to understand and read; I personally couldn't put it down. I wish it was twice as long while still marinating the high info density... Most authors just babble and every few pages actually tell you something; this is not the case with this book!  ---  --- The programming of a robot is everything... and behavior based programming is the only way to go. This book provides a very good intro into that very subject. The only complaint I have is not about the book but his robot simulation program on is website which is referred to in the text. It seems to be rather slow and over taxing for the PC, but being a Java app it's not that surprising. ---  --- Highly recommended to anyone building robots
I do agree that books containing racist positions should not be given to children without a strong and fully aware comment. But I simply cannot stand to buy a sanitised version of a book without being aware of it. This is called censorship, and it gives me the creeps. As a parent, I have had enough real life opportunities to prove racism wrong to my children. So to realise that somebody has been cheating on me, trying to do my job so that I did not have to explain how society has evolved, how difficult it has been for minorities to be recognised and respected is just a fraud. this review is about the Harper collins Edition , edited by Patricia C. and Frederick L. McKissak, illustrated by Michael Hague
THIS IS JUNK NOT MUSIC.NEON MOON IS THE WORST SONG EVER!IT IS SO BORING AND DULL.AND A COOL DRINK OF WATER IS A HORRIBLY WRITTEN AND SUNG SONG!THIS MUSIC BORES ME!LEAVE IT ALONE AND STICK TO RAP,ROCK,OR METAL.COUNTRY SUCKS
I saw this magazine while browsing a local bookstore and it was a magazine that stood out for some reason...I picked it up and flipped through a few pages and came across an article on Maggie Gyllanhall.  I had recently watched "Secretary," and I liked her, so I bought it.  I'm not much for fashion magazines but this is much different from others like Vogue.  After buying my first Flaunt magazine, I wanted to buy more, but needless to say, the bookstore has not gotten any in for a long time...:(  This magazine will be great for readers who are bored with the same crap churned out in every other magazine out there..
This tractor is advertised as a great back yard toy but is geared to high for younger children.  My son, who is almost 4 is a very stong bicycle pedaler but he can not make this tractor move across the lawn.  It would be great if you have a lot a pavement to ride it on, but if you planning on them ridding it through the back yard, forget it.  This is an on pavement toy only
The Digital Rebel is the most amazing camera i've ever owned. My previous camera was a Canon A90 and I loved using all the features on it [great camera!]. I decided recently that maybe I should graduate to a SLR because I was starting to get more creative with my photography. I spent a great deal of time researching cameras and finally decided on the Digital Rebel. After a few months of owning it I still am amazed. The image quality is fantastic, it's quick and responsive, and every day using it I learn a little more. It's the perfect intro SLR camera for me because everything makes sense and it's easy to learn. I've gotten amazing shots that I could never dream of getting with a point and shoot.  ---  --- If you are finding yourself wanting a little more than a point and shoot, go for this camera, you wont be sorry.
My wife uses these cards in conjunction with her Printmaster program to create a variety of greeting cards.  She really loves this product as it has an integral pre-fold crease which facilitates a pefect fold after printing
I received this a a gift for Valentine's Day this year.  It's a nice bubble bath with lots of foam (rather than big, double bubbles).  It's chock full of natural ingredients and no SLS so it's very gentle- even for little ones.  I do however prefer the Deep Steep in the calming lavender chamomile or energizing rosemary mint. 
I ordered this clock, and then had to send it back two times before it finally arrived undamaged (actually, minimally damaged). The first two times the glass was cracked and broken. By the third time, all that was the matter was minor dent marks in the metal frame where the packaging must have pressed down on it (this is only noticeable in certain light angles). The shipping problems weren't the manufacturers fault though, as Amazon did the packing and shipping. It'd be nice if they maybe put a big "Don't stack things on top of this box" sticker or something on the box so that it didn't get damaged. Or, bubble wrap, remember that stuff?! Those airbags just ain't cuttin' it.  --- On the clock itself, I love it. I kept it despite the minor denting b/c it has been discontinued by the manufacturer, and it's the largest atomic clock I could find that didn't have some ugly antique-ish design. The second hand actually ticks, instead of fluidly moving, which is a nice touch. It was easy to set up, and it's big and easy to read. It reminds of the clocks all over my high school (in a good way). All in all, very happy with the actual clock, very dissatisfied w/ Amazon's shipping and packing of it
I have been canvasing the internet for some type of guard to cover the hearth in our family room.  I have read countless reviews of the "double faced tape foam pads" that come off right away with little effort. --- This product attached exactly as described.  I had the unit installed as well as the pads measured, cut and installed in 10 minutes.  The taupe color is very discrete on our cream, red & black brick fireplace.  I can't see how my three little ones would ever get this off even if they tried.  Great product and gives me the feeling of comfort that if someone falls and hits there head that the chance of sticthes has been greatly reduced.  An absolute must for your hearth.
I wore these shoes when I worked on my feet all day and they really helped with pain in my feet, ankles, knees and hips. I could really feel the difference from my other work shoes and the "teeth" in the shoes on the soles of my feet really felt good. Being diabetic, I am very concerned about circulation and I believe this was a good purchase. A little expensive, but well worth it in the end. I plan on buying more
The knots in my back - my "spots" never really go away due to posture and my work in front of the computer.  One day I asked a coworker what the odd green thing by his desk was.  He explained the concept, I tried it for about two seconds and immediately knew this was something special.   The leverage is perfect for zeroing in on your back knots and applying STRONG pressure to them - like having a strong friend digging their knuckle in and holding it there.  I bought one the next day.  You don't need an expensive vibrating massage wand that has all sorts of silly features - just this simple stick that can pinpoint and dissolve all your stress spots. 
This is a great little desktop charger pocket for the Motorala V60 and an additional battery.  However, it seems expensive for what you get, not to mention the fact that what the text doesn't tell you is that you need an *additional* (expensive?) serial cable/adapter in order to use it with your regular charger cable.  Unless you want to charge an additional battery at the same time, save money and just get the nifty travel charger with the folding plug for the bargain price...and just place the phone down on your desk or tabletop while it charges
I hate to use this word, but this product truly is ORGASMIC. It comes out perfect, cup after cup, having a creamy yet zingy taste. The first time I tried it was at Einstein Bros. Bagels (the use the concentrate themselves to create "their" Chai Tea Latte). When I first tried this, I exclaimed to myself, "WOW!!!!". Any person I have ever served this to was willing to vouch that their tastebuds were in sheer ecstasy. ---   ---  Mr. Oregon Chai Tea Latte Concentrate, THANK YOU
I used one of these water-blades at a school car wash and was sold. The parent that brought the water-blade said he had received it as a gift and was really happy with it, used it a lot. It does not remove all the water, you still have some small amounts that will require a towel, but this is a small amount. We used it on 20-30 cars at the car wash to pre-dry the cars before the kids finished the job and it worked great! Purchased one for myself, so I guess that's a good recommendation
I got this jacket last week, I liked it for the price i paid
These gloves are extremely high quality. They do a great job of protecting your hands, and for most exercises, they do help your grip. The have the best wrist support of any glove I've used to date. However, as mentioned: if you have small hands, the added padding/rubber in the gloves will decrease the circumference of your grip in general. This is a problem for exercises like deadlifts, chin ups, etc. Also, the material inside is a bit like felt. When your hands are sweaty, these gloves basically adhere to your hand on the inside and it usually takes me 1-2 minutes to get them off. They may just need to be broken in more, but I've used them for 3 weeks thus far. 
I have a small head and this was way too tight for me.  It pulled my hair and left me with a headache.  Plus it has a strong chemical smell that didn't go away after wearing in the pool. I tried it 3 times, thinking it might get better, but gave up and threw away. Spend a little more and get the fabric or silcon style instead
The product smells really good, is very affordable and helps maintain my hair style all day. I highly recommend trying it. I will make it part of my daily hairdress (grooming) for life!
Be warned that the business card side is deep enough to hold 50 cards.  I bought this wallet only to hold a few credit cards, my ID and some cash.  Hence, there is a lot of wasted space in my wallet.  From the picture, it looks as though the business card side is just a slot. Whereas, in reality, it is actually a pouch (like most of the other card holders).  Other drawbacks are that there is some filler underneath the leather to make it look smoother (which takes up quite a bit of space), the leather itself is very low quality, and the wallet does not close well even without anything in it.  Furthermore, on the inside of the wallet there is a large white tag stating that it was Made in China.  I mean, China is great and all but if you're on a date and you say "Hey, let me pay for this," and you pull out your credit card and a large white tag protrudes with it saying Made in China, well, you are pretty much a schmuck (I cut mine out with a pair of scissors, but there are still some remnants).  So if you like being low class, by all means, buy this wallet.  I personally don't care about my wallet very much so I am keeping it and going to use it, but I almost returned it.  It is most definitely a solid 2 stars.  Hope this helps
I have ordered this coat 2 times and returned both coats.  I'm very disappointed.  This is supposed to be a reversible coat.  However, the hem of the black side is too long. Consequently it hangs below the hem of the bronze side when reversed.  And, it does not look good at all.  The company needs to revise this pattern
One of the Spotlight Reviewers says that by combining two great characters--Sunny Randall and Jesse Stone--Robert B. Parker has doubled our fun. ---  --- Quite the reverse. ---  --- He has cut it in half. ---  --- The characterizations of Sunny and Jesse are enormously feeble; and the the rest of the characters are no great shakes, either. ---  --- Sunny's Irish Mafia uncle is a cardboard cutout.  Suitcase Simpson has three funny lines and is heard from no more.  The villains--Buddy, Erin, Missy, Gerard, Moon--are little more than vague names and stereotyping.  Spike is relegated to a scene and a half. ---  --- Oddly, the only interesting character is a very minor one: Eddie.  But he only stays around for 10 minutes ---  --- Even the plot is tissue-thin. ---  --- The love-story is lame; the sex-scenes boring. ---  --- Worst of all, who should appear but (Christ!) Susan Silverman, from the Spenser series: one of the dampest and most wooden and least interesting characters in fiction. ---  --- As with "Cold Service" and some others, Parker is just coasting with this one. ---  --- He is capable of far better. --- 
This game was given to our 3 year old as a gift and he loves it.  His little sister, who is two, also loves this game.  This game really helps to develop a childs ability to concentrate on visual cues.  It is basically a matching game combined with a puzzle concept.  There are no complex rules to learn, so within minutes of opening the box any child can begin to play and enjoy this game.  As each match is made the child receives immediate reward and motivation to find a new match.  Best of all is that this is a simple game with no buzzers or bells and is best played with the TV turned off
LIVING IN FLORIDA I BOUGHT TWO OF THESE EVERLIGHT FLASHLIGHTS.  --- THE PARTY THAT SAID THERE WAS ENOUGH CHARGE DURING SHIPPINS IS A LITTLE SHAKING IN THE HEAD. IT TAKES AT LEAST A COUPLE OF MINUTES OF OF SHAKING BEFORE THERE IS EVEN A GLIMMER OF LIGHT. AFTER THAT IF YOU DON'T CONTINUE TO SHAKE IT DIES OUT VERY RAPIDLY. --- THIS LIGHT MAY POSSIBLY COME IN HANDY DURING A HURRICANE POWER FAILURE BUT THERE ARE OTHER LED FLASHLIGHTS WITH BATTERIES THAT ARE SUPERIOR TO THIS ONE. THE POWER USED BY THESE LEDS IS LOW AND THE BATTERIES LAST A LONG TIME.
This one is for you.  But honestly now, the guy doesn't write--beautiful voice--but songwriting is a major appeal.  So  guess a solo garfunkel is a lot like a step above Justin Timberlake.  Ok, there are definitely highlihgts like a Heart in Newyork, (what a) wonderful world, but generally this a very casual compilation, good for a couple listens.  in general, Art Garfunkel isn't really good for more than that.  Check out him witht Paul Simon, that is amazing stuff, but this is kinda boring.  I might have a bit more respect if he wrote the songs--but even though there are good songwriters writing for him, the songs are still sub-par
But it does have some faults. I have had it for some time now, I got it for my 11th birthday. I have reviewed the cingular version too, even though mines verizon. ---  --- FAULTS: --- Very short battery life - I have to charge it almost every day! --- Camera - The picture you take can't move or it comes out all messed up. ---  --- GOOD PARTS: --- Big screen - Easy to read! --- Recording videos - Even though you get 15 seconds, I still use that to make funny videos with my friends. --- It's style - I love the color and style! My friends are all jealous. ---  --- Overall, I think it's a great phone
Having looked extensively for a casual parka that works well with jeans I finally found this one. I ordered on-line, and then received a phone call from the company supplying this product through Amazon, verifying that the size I ordered was correct.  The person I spoke with was very friendly and helpful.  She helped me decide that I needed a larger size and I'm very glad because when the parka arrived it was the perfect size.  I love all the pockets.  It has just enough lining to be warm yet comfortable.  And best of all it looks great with jeans and other casual clothing. The outer shell is also very soft.  
Item is advertised as working with all rino series but it does not work with the rino 53
These earrings are of very nice quality and were what I expected. I am pleased with these
We love popcorn as an occasional treat at night, but don't like the salt and fat that usually comes with most microwave popcorn.  We had been using a microwave popper to make our own plain popcorn, but with no oil whatsoever it lacked a little something.  This is just right - low in fat, no salt so we can add seasonings if we choose, and organic to boot. I also feel good about buying Newman's products because of the causes they support and all the money doesn't go to corporate profits
Although I have only read a few specific subjects in this book, I am only giving it 1 start because the information in the section on hyperemesis is extremely inaccurate and perpetuates outdated myths about this very serious and life-threatening disease. For anyone who has had hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), reading that a spa day would be beneficial, is not only absurd, but also insulting. Many women with HG cannot get to another room of the house without help, much less drive a car to a spa! HG is a disease and not a psychological condition. Women cannot stop the disease at will. This myth has resulted in a century of poor and sometimes abusive treatment of these afflicted women, causing excessive and unnecessary stress and misery, not to mention preventable complications during pregnancy and in their resulting children. Some women have life-long effects. (...
First of all I am a huge Beatles nut so any movie made by them or about them i love. With that out of the way I can say that this was a very good movie.  --- For those expecting a movie like A Hard Days Night, it is nothing like that. This movie is about John Lennon's friend who was the bass player for the Beatles at the begginging  of their carrear. it shows how he lost his interst for music and fell in love wiht a German lady. I wont tell u the ending, but this is a true story. --- All in all i thought this was a great movie. You should defiently buy it
The product was as described.  I just didn't realize that I was ordering from an exclusive chocolate store in New York city!  The candies were $2.50 and the shipping was four times that much! (I had it mailed to a U.S. address, not my address in Brazil,in case you're wondering.
I highly recommend these onions. They are absolutely fab! Great in anything from salsa fresca to roasted pork. They are even great on their own or fresh. Just don't let the wife smell you
HA!  Great movie, plot, performances and insights!  Gotta see this one, at least once, for experiencing a truly under-rated masterpiece.  My main reason for writing is the inane comments here and fear with reality that pervades our society.  Those who can't, don't or won't appreciate (at least) the marvelous, insightful messages here are possibly the very ones that assure nothing will ever change much .  Scary to shed light on bare essence of humanity's inhumanity and its inability to rise above the systematic base obsessions of power, control and coveting; whether rationalized with all the reasons that endorse continuing to man's lower instincts or from fear of looking beyond the security of ignorance.  It is amazing that the natural order of things may be better balanced and have a wisdom beyond anything man may attain, as he seeks to control nature and fellow man while failing miserably at controlling himself, even with all his knowledge and tech, to a point equal or beyond the inherent natural wisdom of (so called)lower species.   --- Have some fun and enjoy this movie.  It is powerful and as perfect as it gets in addressing very intriguing human societal conundrums while offering quality performances from a great cast on numerous levels.  As a species, we have come so far and grown so little! This movie will make you (oh-oh) think and feel about subliminal and covert topics o human nature that are rarely put well in words or illustrated in today's world.
THOUGHT THIS WOULD WORK,SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER.A PEN LIGHT WOULD DO THE SAME THING.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,OR YOU WILL LOOK AS SILLY AS ME.I RETURNED THE PIECE OF JUN
I purchased this product to replace a really good 802.11g unit from Linksys, hoping to set up a Gigabit home network with ethernet storage.  I initially considered the WRT300N model, but the reviews were mediocre.  So I went instead for this newer model, hoping that Linksys has fixed the bugs and addressed the problems identified with the WRT300N model.  I am sorry to say that all the bad reviews on the WRT300N also apply to this model.  I am returning it after 5 hours of use. ---  --- On my home network set up with my current Linksys 802.11g unit, I am able to stream 4 different movies to four different laptops at the same time throughout the house, and all four movies display flawlessly.  On this new unit optimized for streaming video, I was not able to stream a movie to a single laptop sitting close to the wireless unit.  The movie had interruptions every 4-5 seconds.  This was worse as the laptop was positioned further from the wireless unit.  Performance was equally bad with laptops equiped with G cards and N cards.  And performance degraded as I tried to stream to multiple laptops at the same time. ---  --- The speed of the links to my laptops equiped with N cards was 144 Mb/s, and was 54 Mb/s on those equiped with G cards.  So the connection seemed fast enough.  It might be that by tweaking the wireless unit in some way, it might be able to perform as I expect.  But I don't have time to waste on such tweaking, and given that my 802.11g unit performed flawlessly out of the box, there is no point to "upgrade" to this new flawed model.  I'll delay my plans for a gigabit home network until the technology has matured and the bugs have been worked out
This game is very good. They only add in a coople people to the stoy line but that is cool. The game folows the movies well. You can even blow up buildings. The only thing i dislike about this game is that is a littel repeditave. Lastly, you can get in high speed cases with the cops
I love this watch. It's perfect for swim workouts and aquathlon races -- takes splits, can do intervals, etc. I use a different product with a heartrate monitor for my runs, but can't use it for my swims (since heartrate monitors can't transmit under water, and also, the unit itself is not waterproof). This Timex has an audible chime under water, and it's easy to set the various functions. It stores your workout splits so you can recall them later when logging your workout. I also love the 3 alarms - my schedule is different every day, so I use the alarms to remind me when to leave work for school, when to leave to pick up my son, etc. I had lost my first watch (same model), but never found another watch that had all the features I wanted for a reasonable price. This is my second one!
I have been looking for a larger CF card for my Dell Axim x50v. the seagate CF drive does not work. finally, i got this working for this price. I think it's good.
I enjoy all the features of this item. ---  --- The main compartment that hold the camera is soft and secure. You can open it without worrying about your camera falling off. ---  --- The back compartment is roomy enough for all the basic gear. The slot for memory cards 1-4 (depends on the card type), batteries (roomy for four AA), and cables can fit in it. ---  --- The shoulder strap is basic and looks flimsy. It's not long enough to hold comfortable diagonally but on the side is good. The belt loop is very secure and can fit on belt three inch in width. ---  --- It can even handle the worst environment ever. Hot, dry climate with sandstorms and occasional accidental drops. It has protected my dig. camera very well
Half-Life made its debut in 1998, and it shocked the entire world. Half-Life at the time featured stunning graphics, gameplay, and sound. It was simply one of those games that had to be in every gamers hands, and still to this date Half-Life is a game that every action-game developing company carefully needs to study in order for their games to be a success. Shortly after the release and once the gasp from the world has ended, two game developers joined together to create a game that not gasped the world again, but made it scream. ---  --- The game pits terrorists and counter-terrorists in a fast-paced sort of "S.W.A.T." type of tactical firefighting gameplay. Matches can consist of one of two types of game types. The first and probably the most popular type is bomb defusal. In both of the game types, you can win by either eliminating the opposing team or following the objective. In bomb defusal a random player on the team will receive the bomb each round. The player can plant the bomb in one of two bomb spots or simply drop the bomb for another teammate to pick it up and use it. Once the bomb is planted the counter-terrorists must defuse it regardless if the terrorists have been eliminated. The counter-terrorists usually have about thirty-five seconds to defuse the bomb and win the round. The second type of gameplay is hostage rescue. The terrorists must protect four hostages in an area of the map from the counter-terrorists rescuing them and taking them to their base. If the hostages are killed by the terrorists or counter-terrorists, nothing will happen except that now the counter-terrorists must completely kill the terrorists to gain victory in the round. At the start of each round all players have a few seconds to quickly buy weapons with the money they have achieved from past rounds by victories. Both teams have a significant difference in the arsenal of weapons you can choose from, but neither really focuses on a specific time of gun style. All of the weapons in the game are one-hundred percent realistic and deadly as in reality. This is an element that makes Counter-Strike such a superior game.  ---  --- Counter-Strike is without argument the most popular online action game in the world. An entire culture has formed around it. So what makes it such an extremely addictive and popular game? It is purely because of the fantastically well-crafted gameplay and not the graphics, or the game would not be as popular as it is. Players around the world will give you many "deep" reasons why it is such a great game. But one without argument stands out. It is simply the fact that versus other games, it is "difficult" to make a kill in the game. What makes the game so addicting is the pleasure of killing someone after a long thirty second gunfight or a quick shot to the head, knowing that the dead player is now experiencing some form of anger as he waits out the rest of the round. Another element is how realistic the guns feel in the game. Regardless if they are fake and the shooting has been totally simulated, it has been superiorly well done. And definitely once a new player to the game has gained enough experience to achieve kills at least periodically, a feeling of "power" will be experienced when holding an AK-47 or an M4. The game is quite punishing to new players, and a total hapzard to players who have never played first-person shooters or video games at all. But regardless the stress you feel at first, there is absolutely no reason to put down the game because of the entry-difficulty, as it is almost guaranteed you will get better in the game. ---  --- There are over ten maps in the game, and each one has been done as a masterpiece. All of the maps wildly differ from each other in the feel of action and even the environment. The most popular of all the maps, de_dust2 that has been created by DaveJ, is still commonly referenced in many gaming parodies, magazines, shows, etc. Due to its style and simplicity, it is a godly-designed map and arguably the most popular map in first-person shooter history. One thing that helps to fight a player of being bored of the game is simply the maps. Since each map has been superbly designed, a player could easily switch to another one after being bored and continue on with play, and with a different feel. The game also has many public map editors which 3rd parties can use to create custom maps. fy_iceworld and awp_map are some very popular maps that have been created by amateur designers. This makes Counter-Strike a game with an almost "infinite" value sort of feel.  ---  --- The sound in Counter-Strike is absolutely insanely-realistic. The first time a player plays or even watches another player play the game, the person will definitely without a doubt notice the clear sounds of AK-47 fire or pistol fire. Not much is known why the guns sound so realistic, and the player's best guess is that the designers have actually recorded live gunfire of the weapons. The sound of the weapons combined with the look and feel; end up making the player totally immersed into the game and with a feeling of "power". This sort of thing is extremely rare in video game.  ---  --- At the time Counter-Strike had simply jaw-dropping graphics. Created all from the Half-Life engine, players were amazed at the lighting effects and how clear the textures were. At the present, the game doesn't hold the same, but it is what in the past has mattered. Half-Life was one of the first games in history to have some slightly complex and dynamic physics. The bouncing of a flashbang or a player being blown away was also something at the time to look at. Games before the release of Half-Life hardly had any sort of physics, and if they did, it would be something very basic.  ---  --- Counter-Strike is a game that without argument should be on any player's hard drive. There are still even thousands of players that since from the release of the game back at 1998, still actually play the game without losing an ounce of boredom. Counter-Strike will forever be played, and is the heart of all action games from the past, present, and the future.
The Floppy Seat is a great item... No more worrying about baby's hands and mouth touching filthy shopping carts and restaurant highchairs.  I recommend this to all new moms and give it an A++
I purchased this for my teenager to use with her IPod Nano. I shopped around for a while before I finally decided on this one because it came with losts of accesories and she uses it everyday all the time and says it works perfectly. I've only had it for a month but it's holding up in the hands to a teen and no complaints so far.
My husband loves Ensavor Garlic Chicken Stew.  He loves the taste, the convenience, and the fact that it is made for diabetics.  My husband is pre-diabetic and is on a medically supervised diet for his condition.  He keeps Ensavor in his office for lunch, in his briefcase for meals out with clients, and takes it with him when he travels.  It's a great product.
Although it kept time (which indicates the batteries were good) this didn't work the first day I used it. It worked the second day. It stopped working by the third day AND the battery cover broke off sometime during the day and was lost. This was a complete waste of $19
If you must have a cookie, might as well make it a healthy one.  I bought a case and they went fast
I bought this DVD on the basis that Shania Twain performed the half time show. Even when i did a search for Shania Twain this DVD was listed - INCORRECTLY - as there is NO Shania performance on the DVD. As far as the football goes i really can not comment as i am from the UK and know nothing about American Footbal - sorry!!
Bought the massager - overall OK but it is heavy to use with one hand, after sometime it gets to you.  It has a good vibration capability better than the others i had. Could have a better handle and a longer cord.  How about making them 110 - 240V then i can travel with it
I'm a big believer in reading Amazon reviews -- customers rarely lead me astray!  But this chair (which we bought specifically because of everyone's praise) is miserable!  I don't understand why it got such high marks...  The tray is way too huge for easy cleaning and it (rather than the chair) has a "leg separator," which means you can't set it down anywhere without it tipping all over the place.  We've also found that the tray can be EXTREMELY difficult to hook onto the chair, and doesn't push in towards the baby's belly far enough.  In addition, the clips that attach the harness are filled with grooves and can't be cleaned well, so they're beyond gross, just after a few feedings.  Of all the baby things we wish we'd never bought, this is number one on the list...  I can't help feeling that if we'd just closed our eyes and pointed at random to a high chair, we would have done better than this thing...  The only reason it gets ONE star is because I appreciate the non-obnoxious print -- it's nice to not have something on display with clowns or fish or teddy bears or bright colors.  ;
We bought this for our son for Christmas this year based on glowing reviews. What a disappointment! The "musical instruments" are basically glorified rattles that all sound basically the same, the song the drum plays is tinny, scratchy, and short, and nothing seems very well made. I at least expected the different instruments to sound different from one another.  ---  --- On the plus side, it is cute, and the lobster has a pretty wind chime like sound
My daughter purchased this with Christmas money and it did not work at all. We reported this to Amazon and they took care of immediately. I was very impressed! Now we have a new toy that she loves that works great. It is fun to play with and a storage container when she's finished.
This fun fragrance comes across to me as soft and slightly sweet, with a feel that's both young and a bit sexy.  The scent is quite pretty, with a bit of floral, and the lightness of it makes it a perfect everyday scent (although it works well for romance, too!).  As mentioned above, the scent does have a youthful, fresh feel to it, and although I've heard some say that the fragrance is best for teens, I'm almost 40, and I enjoy it on days that I'm looking for something lighthearted and fun (granted, I probably wouldn't wear it everyday).  Lucky You comes in a cute pink bottle with a unique rubber stopper, and it has good staying power, although the scent grows more subtle over time.  Recommended for women of all ages who are young at heart
The "bad serial number" routine as the first reviewer. I'll try Adobe Customer Service when I stop fuming
Loved this mat!  --- Great for taller yogis. --- great tickness too... --- A bit slippery but after a couple of sessions it wears off --- I totally recommend it! 
Made another bull**** album. Honestly I didn't hear this whole album. About 5 years ago I was ridin wit one of my boys and he played this cd. Oh my god for the first time in my life I wished I was deaf. I see the reason why her albums sell though. Cause its her looks and nothin else. She's not ugly at all to me. She just can't sing. But she can livin up a crowd. I'm just waitin to see her and 50 cent doin a song together, two of the worst people in music, millionaires. Go figure
I ordered ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite 2006 after a PC magazine review,   I have a 3 month old HP Media Center PC.   Th software totaly locked up my machine on install twice.   Each ocasion requireing me to reboot in safe mode and to use the restore function to even use my computer.   I lost 6 - 8 hours of work befoe I decided to return it.   I did receive my refund 8 to 10 weeks after returning the product.    I am now using Norton Internet Security with no problems.  I transfered it from an older abandoned PC. ---  --- I mave been a PC user since 82 and am fairly knowledge about hardware and software.   This is one of the few programs I could not instal.   I have used the free Zone Alarm Firewall without problems. ---  --- ew
Really does not get the film noir credit it deserves (probably from its title with the uninformed film watcher expecting this to be a feature starring Dinah Shore or other 1940's musical starlet.) Some very satisfying twists of the old plot make this memorable and high on the repeat viewings scale.  Gene Tierney is wonderfully mercurial - sometimes hot-hot-hot and other times just plain icy cold. This was her only Oscar nominated film and you can see why she was picked here.  See Gene in this and in "Laura" and you will see two of the best 1944 leading actress film perfomances
I have a 7 week old baby and this is the only bag we have used, thus far.  I can carry my baby in a sling on the front and this bag slung over my back at the same time.  It seem quite rugged, and holds a ton! I can carry 4 newborn diapers or 2 cloth diapers, a travel wipes container, a small changing pad, a couple of spare onsies, a nursing shawl, 2 washcloths for spit up, an extra receiving blanket, a 4 oz bottle of cleanser, phone, lipstick, keys and wallet, and that is only in the main compartments.  The only proplem I've had was that the fastener on the bottle holder came off before I had even used the bag, but I was able to fix it.  I may want a bigger bag when she starts needing toys and food to come along, but for now, this is perfect
 ---        Tried and true might well describe the products offered by Caswell-Massey as generations have relied upon them for both quality and efficacy.  Established in 1752, it's America's oldest Chemist and Perfumer.  My grandmother enjoyed their products, and I do, too. ---  ---  Their Almond & Aloe Liquid Soap is a boon because it not only cleanses well but moisturizes as it does so.  Far too many soaps leave skin feeling dry and itchy. ---  ---  Almond, as we  know, has a lovely distinctive fragrance as well as skin softening properties.  Combine it with aloe which contains healing properties, and you have a uniquely beneficial cleanser. ---  ---  Other ingredients include Vitamins A and D for nourishment.  This soap is particularly useful for those who wash their hands frequently during the day and for those with normal to dry or sensitive skin. ---  ---  Other items in Caswell-Massey's Almond & Aloe line include Body Balm, Bath Seltzer, Cold Cream Soap, Hand Cream, Hand & Body Emulsion, and Almond Body Splash
I received these today in the mail and am pleased with the way these feel on my feet,they are so comfortable and so easy to slide on
If you're like me - middle-aged, white, male, conservative, Christian, who buys most of my clothes at Old Navy - you will be the target of all the condescending ridicule in every article.  And yet I find it very entertaining!  Although I'll never be able to afford even one of their recommended outfits, and I'm usually a full 180 degrees opposite of their political views, I find their articles interesting, well-written, and insightful.  I must admit, I should hate Esquire, because the editors and writers would find me disgusting.  But somehow I look forward to seeing it in my mailbox every month.  The writers, if nothing else, are intelligent, which is more than I can say for the writers in most guy magazines like FHM and Maxim
Product is hard to review because you sent me the wrong battery.  As of 1/29/07 it has not been taken off my credit card.  How would you rate my review
Nice product before they decided to save a few pennies - I have purchased seven, but now it is made with out the handle - so if that was part of the atraction of this case, note that the discription says 'sturdy padded handle' -- NOT! --- 5 STARS if it still had the handle or if you don't need one
I tried it on 4 laptops, and none of them was able to sustain the signal. It kept on dropping out! Mind you, two of the internal cards did a much better job than it. --- 
I bought these for my dad for Christmas and they did not fit his head, they didn't even fit mine and I have an average size head. Another thing, they did not look cool at all, they were ridiculous looking, nothing like the Photoshopped pictures
My girls were given this game a couple years ago. . .ages 2 and 3.  They crack up over the voices and play it still.  I like it also b/c it's so darn cute
This was my first time to ever attempt using a software program to file my taxes. TurboTax sounded easy enough. And it was pretty easy at first. The software interviewed me in an efficent manner and saved all of my information. But the final tax forms I needed to file with were not included on the CD-ROM package. TurboTax instructed me to get them by using "one-click update." Well after I update and attempt to restart the software, TurboTax refuses to come up at all. I can't speak for this software on Windows machines. But if you are using Mac OS X, I suggest you explore other options first
I always say that there is technology you can use and technology you can impress others with. --- This model helps you do both. You have a nice 5.1 MP still camera and MPEGMovie4TV video. --- The very fact that you have a camera which you can take both still pictures and video is huge. I never had a video camera before because I hate to carry two camera and a big camera case, so this was the obvious solution. --- I realize that instead of embracing the moment (for which they need the memory) most people often juggle between cameras. --- Cons: --- * Sometimes people might confuse it with camera phone --- * Buttons are harder to find --- * Software is not the best --- * Wish had more zoom --- Pros: --- * Convince --- * Compact --- * Battery lasts long --- * Flash is good --- * Video sound quality is good --- I wonder why this model has not swept the market - another story of good product and mad marketing
Every once in a while I like to pick up a book that is outside the realm of usual reading, and look for a surprise, or spark to keep the fires of imagination from dying out - it is with this mindset I picked up "Wouldn't Take Nothing for My Journey Now."  And what did I find as a result of my maverick literary exploration?  Ehh... ---  --- Ms. Angelou may not take anything for her journey, but based on the cover price she will take $17.00 to tell you a bit about it, and even this may not even seem like that bad a deal were it not for the fact that either her journey was bland, her insights wanting or her conclusions misguided - whatever the cause, this book is dreadful.  If you are looking for the usual meaningless new age spiritual gobble-gook; i.e., about boundaries, respect, finding ones direction, learning what it means to be a women, etc. then this journey is for you - but if you see this nonsense as the nonsense it is, you will be best served my buckling up your shoes and journeying elsewhere
This is the last hair straightener you will every buy. Heats up quickly and straightens long, thick and even curly hair in minutes. Haven't stopped receiving compliments since I started using it.
Beautiful detailed and accurate time piece. I have a few watches and this is one I place ahead of all the others I have. Large face and can be read at a glance
This was a total waste of money, it's a real cheapo like something out of a cracker jack box.
We own two of these and they have never been easy to use.  We tore holes in the first one trying to insert the seat.  We have kept it though.  We bought another and on our second trip the zippers broke off.  We would not buy this one again.  We do have large carseats - they are both Britax Marathons
NANOPARTICLES???? I was in the process of re-ordering this item until I read the description.  Apparently you're using the public to ascertan whether or not these nanoparticles are safe.  Thanks a lot, Lancome!  Not on MY face!   
Cast:  Denzel Washington, John Goodman, Donald Sutherland, Embeth Davidtz, James Gandolfini, Elias Koteas, Gabriel Casseus, Michael J. Pagan. --- Running Time:  123 minutes --- Rated R for violence and language. ---  --- "Fallen" starts with convicted serial killer Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas) being executed in the gas chamber as the man who brought him to justice Detective Jon Hobbes (Denzel Washington) looks on. Hobbes thinks that this is the end but soon has to rethink as he receives a phone call which tells him to check a house out where he finds a dead man named Muscovich (Glen Witko) in a bathtub having been poisoned, the same way Reese used to kill his victims. At first Hobbes fears a copy cat killer but during the course of his investigation the name Robert Milano comes up, a decorated cop who apparently committed suicide. Hobbes speaks with his daughter Gretta (Embeth Davidtz) who at first is reluctant to speak with him. Things become even stranger when the man who killed Muscovich, Charles (Robert Joy) is found dead in exactly the same way having been poisoned again. Eventually Gretta tells Hobbes the truth, he is in fact dealing with an ancient demon called Azazel who has the power to jump form body to body at will by mere psychical touch. The demon Azazel seems to be taunting Hobbes, ruining his life & career, setting him up for murder & getting to his friends & family. Hobbes must find a way to destroy the ancient demon before it destroys him & everyone he cares about. ---  --- Charismatic leading man Denzel Washington is suitably cast as the protagonist and proves to have range, while John Goodman is okay but greatly underused while the same applies to James Gandalfini who plays almost the exact same character. Donald Sutherland doesn't prove to have any range, doing the usual gruff routine that he does in nearly all of his movies. Embeth Davidtz is a talented and totally under-rated actress. She delivers a good performance and shows great potential for the future.  The directing and camera work in this movie was superb. It was done in such a way where you can see Azazel's spirit go from person to person simply by following the camera up and down the crowd and watching the subtle touches one makes in a normal walk about town.  Although this film does require your full attention, it does not go unrewarded and you are not left at the end scratching your head wondering what had happened for the past two hours.  "Fallen" is an intelligently written, supremely efficiently executed, and one of the most unheralded, unnoticed thrillers of the late part of the decade.  One of the better of its kind
I saw this pair of shoes and thought that they were very cute, however, when they arrived they had smalls stains on over the front of the shoe. Very Very disappointed, I will return the shoes and never order anything from this seller again.
This magazine is amazing!!  It keeps getting better and better, unlike all the other sell-out magazines such as Muscle & Fitness. It's a shame it doesn't have more readers! If you like the mag then pass it around, people work hard to put it together! A great buy!
This is a complete joke.  The only cities that are in the program for U.S. states are major metro areas. If you have a handheld (either regular or mobile phone) you more than likely also have WiFi or GPRS internet connection.  And if you are in a major metro area, with a WiFi connection, why would you need a program for maps?  Just go to Yahoo Maps or Mapquest.  If you don't have a WiFi, then just buy a paper map...it will do the same thing (maybe even more!) than this program. ---  --- The only possible way this program could be useful is if you already have a handheld GPS receiver AND you never find yourself outside major metropolitan cities.  I have a GPS receiver for my laptop (USB) which I though could connect to my handheld and it won't...so my advice is to buy an entire package (software and handheld-specific GPS receiver). ---  --- Can't believe Microsoft put its name on this junk
Perhaps if I hadn't already had a different type of bunting, I wouldn't be so disappointed with this one. My sister loaned me her Eddie Bauer bunting when my son was born. She will be having her next baby any week now, so I had to return it to her which meant I had to buy a new one. I saw nothing but great reviews on this product, so I picked one up. ---  --- First of all, I followed the washing instructions, washing it separately on delicate and drying it on low, and it ripped at the one seam!! Based on that alone, I will be returning it. ---  --- Aside from that, having used a bunting with a different design, I am not thrilled with this one. Part of the point of using a bunting is so that when you're in a car where you have heat, you can open up the bunting on a longer drive so baby doesn't overheat. This bunting zips down both sides to the bottom (by the way, zipping/unzipping is tricky with a baby kicking around; the zipper gets stuck in the material a lot), rather than down the middle front (that style zipper was NEVER a problem). Then you have this thick cover at baby's feet and nowhere to go with it, as the bottom of the carseat is up against the back seat of the car! So you either have to rig it so it is up the back of the seat and tucked under the headrest, or you have to leave it on baby's legs. ---  --- Also, the top of this bunting does fold over so that baby's face isn't covered unless you want it to be, BUT...my 5-month old has no problem picking it up and pulling it up over his own face. He did it this morning on the way to daycare. This bunting is too thick for me to feel comfortable with him doing that. And I can't be reaching in the back seat to pull it down off his face! ---  --- There is no disputing that the concept of a bunting is great, and that this particular bunting is toasty warm. It is wonderful being able to put the baby in his carseat and strap him in safely w/out a snowsuit being in the way, or having to bundle him up before going out and unbundle him every time you get to your destination. But I don't think the design of the Urban Bundle-Me is great and I actually think this bunting is TOO warm (even with the bunting open on a long car ride the other day, my son's back was all sweaty when we took him out of the carseat). After calling several stores and looking at all my options at Babies 'R' Us, I ended up ordering a new Eddie Bauer All-Season Bunting from Target.com (which cost less than $20 including shipping). I can't wait till it gets here. I will be returning the $60 Urban Bundle-Me as soon as I can
There are no doubt a few nuggets of wisdom in this book, but they are buried too deeply in bureaucratic gibberish to be worth digging up.  This book has no bibliography, no index, mediocre footnotes, no serious useful conclusions or strategic summary, and a disturbing combination of American-centrism (on page 71: "In the Asian continent....(t)he first driver will be the future U.S. role in Asia.") with a lack of intelligent presentation.  There are exactly three figures and seven tables in this 336 page book, when there should have been at least 30 tables and figures illustrating specific sources of conflict in relation to specific countries.  The World Conflict and Human Rights Map (8 pages of graphics and 8 pages of fine print) out of Leiden University does vastly more to inform than does this book.  This book should never, ever have been published in its present form--I venture to say that if it were condensed to 150 pages and properly edited, with graphics and good synthesis, it might be worthy of a second look.  Time is the most precious commodity in the world--RAND managers and editors need to get serious about how they present possibly useful information to experts who want to know what RAND thinks, but cannot spare the time to get past cumbersome undisiplined--even lazy--preparations.  The topic of this book is extremely important--those who would invest their scarce time and money in doing research in this area deserve better from those who put together this book
This is quality jerky....probably the best I have found so far....
We looked everywhere for a trash can for our van.   --- This was the only one I could find that was what we were looking for. --- It fits perfectly in our van and never tips over
Great purchase. If you like to keep your vehicle looking good and don't have a lot of time to wash it when it is only dusty, then this is a great time saver. Takes only minutes and looks like it was just cleaned. Well worth the money.  
I love the plug-in feature, there's been many times I've left the swing on (have to rush to change a diaper and left it on). True, it will stop if lightly touched or a blanket falls.  ---  --- The swing isn't incredibly fast, but for my 2 month old, it's worked well. There are two volume levels for the music, but I've only used the lowest setting.
If I could give it negitive stars I would! We bought two of these gates due to a couple of very wide openings that needed to be secured. These gates are horrible and very poorly designed. Every time someone tries to open the gate, it sags and pulls the wood dowels out of the frame and it completely falls apart! We have older children that have had to resort to crawling over it to get into the living room just to avoid its eminent collapse. And often it collapses anyway. Now my 11 month old son has figured out that if he shakes the gate at the joint he can pull it completely apart and crawl right through. Now we have to purchase new gates that actually work to replace these.
Finally, a product that does as it promises.  Excellent sun burn protection -- even in Hawaii
This is simply wonderful licorice with an intense, layered flavor.  My Dad's a long-time licorice fan and this stuff gives him a big smile -- so he's getting a four-pack for Christmas! ---  --- Great texture, great flavor, great price

Great invention to those who don't want to be attached to an IPOD, and like an updated version of a "juke box". Easy to use, load, unfortunately however, it requires an receiving unit to broadcast the sound
My daughter is 7 years old and can do this by herself with no problems.  It came with three framed art works.  She crunched them and then hung them up in her room.  Very cute!  Fun bright colors and very easy to use.  One of the things I liked best about this craft is that it wasn't messy!  That's a huge plus for me as a parent
The "Essential Histories" series from Osprey could easily be compared to the Cliff Notes series.  They'll give you a nice introduction to a topic you are not familiar with, but no real depth.  Most volumns are under 100 pages; therefore, don't expect many "man in the trenches" stories. ---  --- This volumn is a nice introduction to a recent war, and presented a bit better than most in the series
The knife is sleek and has a great profile. I love the speedsafe function on it. The blade lock is a bit stiff, but I suppose that's just so it doesn't slide open on accident
The product did just what I wanted and that is to burn videos onto dvds from my camera.  I had an earlier version of Nero but it would not do this. 
I'm very pleased with the comfort and design and appearant durability. I just wish it would get colder and stay cold long enough in Arizona to wear them more often:
Read the ingredients. Contains refined flour and sugar, hydrogenated oil, corn syrup, and artificial colors. For someone who may be sensitive to chemicals diabetic or hypoglycemic, this would be a poor substitute for real food. I personally would become ill from ingesting this sort of thing. Always read the labels and be sure that the product is safe for YOU
I recommend this movie as a most usually high star. The Torch Song Trilogy has done something that no other movie producer has dared to do (I will leave it to you to identify what that is). The torch song trilogy has blended wisdom and humor in a comical theatrical version of the life of drag queen, who is more than what she appears to be on stage. It identifies with what most homosexuals yearn for and the strength it takes to get it. This movie is inspirational, comical, sad, and dramatic. There is no other movie of its kind, and no other movie compares. The movie identifies that love can overcome all- and that if there is one thing homosexuals want, it is acceptance, and if you can not do that then get out. This is a must have. The ONLY five star movie I have ever watched
Great buy for 20 bucks. They look nice and fit well. They are distressed but it is not as bad as I thought it would be from reading the other reviews. They look nice with jeans and a dark shirt. Pretty comfy too
These stickers are great. My toddler has a small white table that about every 3 months we decorate with new stuff. This quarter its "Cars" he loves them. They are very durable, vibrant and colorful. Highly recommended
This is the only blemish treatment that I have ever tried that will get rid of anything. Ive been using it for 8 years and it has never let me down.  --- You can use it as a spot treatment or if you have an area of clogged pores on your nose you can put a little on every night to help clear those up. --- It isnt meant to go on the places of your face where you have no acne or blemishes though. It is strong and can cause a little peeling if you put it on your entire face. --- It's a little pricey, but the size of this container will probably last you close to a year
I ordered a KidCo Elongated child gate. A recommended extension needed to be purchased. The wrong extension was sent. I needed G24 model and received 24" extension for a different model
I didn't enjoy the film.  I also didn't enjoy the original play by Shakespeare.  King Lear is one of my least favorite Shakespeare plays.  I don't consider it particularly creative to remake a play that has already been done, and to add nothing of value to the original.  You can set it wherever you like, in medieval Japan or on the Moon, what's the difference.  It's King Lear, a downer of a play, there's nothing great about Ran just as there's nothing great about Lear, and it takes up three hours of your time. ---  --- A moron named Lear, or Hidetoro, or whatever his name is, relinquishes power in his kingdom and turns the power over to his oldest son.  The youngest son warns him that it is a bad idea because the sons will be disloyal to their father.  He is right, of course, and Hidetoro Lear gets treated shabbily.  He's wanted dead or dead. ---  --- In this treatment of the annoying plot, he loses his mind.  He has a faithful follower or two.  They overact.  There is nobody to root for in this depressing and ridiculously overrated downer of a play.  Lear Hidetoro is an absolute jerk.  Am I supposed to care what happens to him?  Why?  Because he used to be a powerful king, and a cruel one?  You may as well cry over Saddam Hussein. ---  --- Look at this movie with fresh eyes.  Look at Shakespeare's King Lear with fresh eyes.  This stuff simply is not very entertaining, and is not very good.  The hell with King Lear.  He's an annoyance
I agree with most of the other reviewers that this is a very weak production with lots of pretentious talk and some pretty poor musical performances which are heavily cut to make more room for chatter. However the couple of minutes where Rory Block sings "If I had Possession Over Judgement Day" are worth the entire price of this DVD. Don't buy the tape 'cos you'll have to sit through so much stuff you won't make it, but on the DVD you can go straight to Rory Block and never watch the rest
This is a piece of junk. The radio reception is terrible. FM is marginal and AM is almost nonexistent.
I just ordered this item from Amazon to be used on my 1995 Dodge Neon... ---  --- However, I have been searching in Product Description ¨What's in the Box¨, --- and have noted that the Actron CP9135 comes with a CD Software...But the --- CP9135 Do not have any visible PC (Serial RS232) conector... ---  --- It is true that this Actron CP9135 is Firmware Upgradeable - Anyone knows how to connect and perform this upgrade? ---  --- Thanks in advance
As a Certified Information Systems Security Professional, I can definitively state that this book does not cover everything that needs to be covered or in any depth whatsoever. I got this book based on the glowing reviews I found here, and I'm at a loss as to why these reviews would have recommended it. ---  --- The most aggrevating part about this book is the subtitle "An Integrated Approach to Security in the Organization." The book not only lacks effective security integration techniques, it doesn't seem to address the entire organization where it tries its half-hearted integration.
Private eye Philip Marlowe is asked for help to get to Mexico by Terry Lennox. Marlowe likes Lennox and agrees to help him, but later Lennox commits suicide in the small Mexican town of Otatoclan. But why was Lennox driven to such extremes? ---  --- Later on, Marlowe is asked for his assistance in keeping the alcoholic writer Roger Wade on the staight-and-narrow. This is not really Marlowe's line of work, but he becomes entangled in the case especially as connections with Lennox begin slowly to emerge. ---  --- This is a longer, more ambitious novel by Chandler albeit displaying the same cynical, tough edge as the other Marlowe novels I've read. The greater length allows Chandler more space for character development and reflection. The danger of this is that the novel could have felt over-extended, but for me it didn't. The ending did not come as a total surprise, but as with every other Chandler novel I've read, enjoyment of the journey rather than satisfaction at the quality of the destination is the important thing. ---  --- G Rodger
Despite the fact that Hanegraaff's name is the bigger of the two on the front cover, only the first 40 pages of this very small book are worth reading, and they are the writing of Paul Maier.  His research is helpful, but so limited in scope that you wonder if he wasn't given a week-end to write it and come up with as much as he could.  Every topic needs futher information.  A lot more could be said, and Maier seems to be the kind of scholar who could have done a lot more. ---  --- Hanegraaff contributes 29 pages of defense of the historical Jesus which is an even more surface-level reworking of information covered much better elsewhere. ---  --- That said, I would give this book to someone who isn't much of a reader but for whom The Da Vinci Code has raised some questions.  It isn't much more than a collection of scattered soundbites, but that may have been a good marketing strategy when there is already such a proliferation of secondary literature on what was only a piece of pulp fiction
Great shows about Binky taking up cycling and learning to challenge himself. There's a cycling champion, Vance Legstrong, who inspires him to succeed (wonder who that character is modeled after). 'Operation DW' is about DW having surgery to get tubes put in her ears. Some really funny stuff in this one but that's pretty much par for the course with the DW based episodes
Pop a battery in and forget it, it sets itself and was right on the dot even after daylight Savings time came in
I bought this case to protect the best bar phone on the market, the Sony Ericsson W810I. Within 2 Days the case already started to crack and chip. I dropped the phone once and the phone came flying out of the case. The case also scratches easily too. The only good thing is that it looks nice and stylish, but I have a feeling that I am going to have to replace it pretty soon.  ---  --- Bottom Line: This case only protects against scratches.I was actually looking at the Clear Silicone Cases
Excellent book, a good guide to improve project managemen
Just disappointed is all.... --- Wasn't what I expected and it's very cheaply made.... --- 
pants were strangely short and bodysuit extra long. also there was a tear in the sleeve of the bodysuit. the quality of the fabric is poor. it served my short term purpose, but i wouldn't purchase this same product again.
I was expecting much more from this video. It did have kids doing poses, but it was hard to find the 13 year-old. Some of the circle games looked like they might  be fun.   I wanted to show  it to my third grade class, but I don't think it would hold their interest.  All in all I felt I was watching someone's home video of their family doing yoga
I realize the price being so low that I would not receive a top of the line bike cover which is fine.  I did expect to receive a cover which would fit my brand new average size mountain bike ~ it does not.  since it does not fit over both tires, the plastic snaps that cinch it tight do not come together to make a complete unit.  I have to use clothes pins in certain areas to seal the cover in enough area to make the cover at least somewhat useable.  My tires and rims are left exposed to the elements and thus are getting mud and moisture on them when it rains.  Even the picture to the right of this review shows the cover with ample room all over the bike ~ very misleading! --- Very disappointed
The metronome was everything I expected.  I wanted a metronome that was very loud so that it could be heard while playing in an ensemble and also one that had a volume control.  The sound is loud enough to be heard while playing ensemble and has good volume control.  It is not digital so one can easily switch tempos. It is light enough to be easily carried around.  What I would have liked, but did not expect is a tempo range that goes beyond 40 - 208.  Unfortunately, that seeems to be found only in digital.  
This liner is thin as advertised, goes on easy, stays, and is really nice stuff.  Be warned, though, the lightest shade is REALLY light, and only good if you're REALLY pale.  It barely shows on me - I'm really pale with strawberry blonde hair and even I should've gone darker on the color.  Recommended
   I got 3 sets of these boxers not knowing much about the quality, fitting, material, etc... All I have to say is these are well worth for the price
Rodney Dangerfield is supposedly becoming mormon(Church of Jesus Christ)  but this movie didn't get any fact right.  the church is never mentioned by name for a reason.  polygamy.  look like Amish.  a collection plate?  this movie stinks and i'm very offended
.............they sent me the wrong size...and didn't leave clear returning guidelines. You are better off getting something cheaper, because this sure as hell wasnt worth the buck
I have always used foam rubber as a topper over our mattress but changed to this Memory Foam.  After using it for one month, I have taken it off the bed and it is back in the box it was shipped in.  I DO NOT like the Memory Foam at all.  It seems to be great when you first lie down on it and then after a hour or two my body just sinks down until it is against the mattress below it and I am not that heavy a person, 160 lbs. It is so hard to find foam rubber but I will search until I find it and never by Memory Foam again!  Doubt I can get my money back.  Have not talked to the Seller about it
Fatally flawed.  Magnificently compact, clever design, but broke first time I used it--el-cheapo plastic clamps snapped.  Service center wouldn't repair it, so I had to return it.  An otherwise beautiful design, with a frustrating Achilles heel.  AARRGH!
The watch came in a great looking case, the face of the watch was attractive. Then - oops couldn't fasten it because there was no fastener. It came with a return address slip for sending it back - which is nice. But I'd rather get what I thought I ordered
I'm pleased with the purchase. I bought this camera just under two years ago when I was getting ready for a trip abroad. ---  --- I spent six months in England, with five weeks travelling around Europe with this camera in its case on my belt. It's very sturdy if nothing else, between the trains, planes, hostels, and general bustle I'm very pleased with how well it held up. Nothing on it broke. ---  --- I probably took at least 400 pictures during my trip, if not more. Sure I've had to swap out batteries on one or two occasions in the two years I've had it, but my general feeling is that the batteries are holding up quite well. ---  --- The zoom on this camera is very nice. It's one of the better zooms I've seen on a simple camera of this type, or at least it was back when I bought it. ---  --- It also has several features that older film cameras do not, such as a timer that you can set before running to get in your own picture, or settings to take "Portraits" or "Night shots." ---  --- I know that this camera cannot compare to professional cameras, I know that it doesn't have all the frills of the new digital cameras, and I am not trying to compare it to those. I'm not a professional photographer, so I don't know how to use a camera with exchangable lenses and whatnot. I don't want a digital for personal and professional reasons. For a traditional film camera, this one is the best I've ever used. ---  --- BOTTOM LINE: Good quality photos, a sturdy build, excellent zoom lens, useful and easy to use features, and long battery life make this camera an excellent choice if you want a traditional film camera with a few perks
As I lay in my non-oversized, non-jetted tub in my four star hotel in Portland, Oregon -- I unscrew the red plastic top of my beloved Tuscan Whole Milk. I savor the moment, taking a swig from my bottle of whiskey and swishing it slowly before I swallow. I'm building to the moment. Braving up for the inevitable splash of cold, white wonderful as it hits my joyful skin. "Hummana!" I exclaim, as the first drops hit my complimentary shower cap. Won't this be a treat. If only it came with a milkmaid. ---  --- Four teAts UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  
Maybe the most engaging documentary ever made. Brilliant style is used in telling the story of one of the giants of the movie industry, producer Robert Evans. Giving magical illumination and motion to still pictures in a way that I could only describe as psychedelic.  ---  --- Being a film fanatic for the last 43 years I was shocked and ashamed to find that I had not heard of Robert Evans. In all my reading of credits over the years I had somehow missed his name. I had remembered seeing William Castle's name at the beginning of Rosemary's Baby but not Evan's. Then, at finding out that he was the driving force behind Love Story, The Godfather, The Godfather Pt.2, Chinatown and one of my personal favorites The President's Analyst and that he was a big reason why those movies were so good, well I was just dumbfounded. And these are just a fraction of the films he's produced. ---  --- Of course he didn't start as a producer. He had been in women's apparel with his brother and accredited their endeavours as the reason why women wear pants today. While lounging around a pool one day he was discovered by Norma Shearer, lauching his career into show biz. It seems he knows everybody and I mean everybody. ---  --- After watchng this extraordinary film I called my father to ask him if he had ever heard of this astonishing personality. I queried, "Have you ever heard of Robert Evans?" anxiously awaiting a "No" so I could tell him all about this amazing show biz entity. He replied, "You mean Bob Evans." Yes indeed, it seems he knows EVERYBODY. My father had come across him in his days as a buyer for Macy's. I asked, "Do you know what he does now?" "He's some sort of movie director or something now, isn't he.", Dad answered. I bought him the audiobook.  ---  --- Evans narrates both the documentary and the audiobook, both which are drawn from his autobiograghy by the same name. His voice is almost as amazing as his story and probably greatly enabled his prowess. He also lent his voice to the short-lived, hysterically irreverent cartoon series Kid Notorious that still airs on Comedy Central. ---  --- All in all, whether you know Evans or not this is a fascinating, beautifully made film about a producer whose achievements are arguably greater than Thalberg's and Selznick's combined. The story of his life and loves is the stuff of legends and it goes on and on. This is a must see for anyone interested in Tinseltown. PS:I don't usually care for the added features but these are worthwhile and the credits to the main part of the documentary are alone worth the price of the disc. What a hoot and more proof that he knows everybody. Ask your dad. Who knows? 
I'm in awe about what this program can do, but I've yet to be able to use it to its fullest. It's not user friendly and I've been designing photo brochures, and marketing literature and multi-media presentations for years with other design software. ---  --- The Corel_Tutor is unwieldy to use and only illustrates the simplest projects. It takes a week to learn the glossary used for the program. And if you don't use it daily, it's easy to forget the glossary and toolbox icons. ---  --- I was hoping the "student & teacher" edition would be more instructive, but it's not. ---  --- I'm currently searching for a tutor who will teach me the complexities of using this program with a hands-on approach
I took this case with me to my trip to New Zealand and it allowed me to take amazing pictures of rafting and cave tubing.  If I didn't have this case I would have missed out on amazing shots.  It's a great way to protect your camera from sand as well.  I loved it so much I actually bought one for my sister as well.  It is a great investment for anyone that doesn't want to worry about their camera getting ruined and also wants to take amazing underwater pictures and videos
I have been using Source of Life Energy Shake for many years.  I recommend one scoop in 8 oz. of orange juice or milk twice a day.   Basically, I pour the milk in a shaker cup and put the scoop on top, close the shaker and shake for a few seconds.   This stuff tastes great and has loads of healthy vitamins, herbs, minerals, and more!     A few months ago, I actually used this drink to cut down on my Starbuck's daily double shot of expresso!   Guess a Source of Life Starbucks Latte would be great, maybe I'll try that someday!  This product deserves more than 5 stars and it is absolutely a great product in every way.   If you are looking for a healthy energy drink that tastes good, you have found it
At first I had some difficulty adjusting to the new interface. Once I got used to it though I find it a lot more useful and comfortable to operate. --- It's a great step forward in all senses for Acrobat!!
Very awesome program for adults and chidren,lots of information on the kids encarta.My son is in first grade and he needed to find some information on money from around the world he did it all himself
I suffer from upper back and shoulder tension.  I've been using neck warmers for years but recently lost the only one I had.  After looking at many warmers, I chose the Happy Wrap.  The wrap stays warm for more than an hour and has the moist heat which is perfect for tense muscles.  My Yorkshire Terrier can't wait until I'm done using it and fights with the cat to get it when I'm finished.
I was really excited about this toy. I was very forgetful when it came to putting my son on his tummy, so I thought this would be a great toy for him to  have some good quality tummy time on. Wrong. He could care less about this toy. The second I'd lay him in front of it he would just roll onto his back. He was five months old when we bought it, and it is just sitting there. He STILL loves his Gymini and he is six months old now. Also, by the third day the aquarium had sprung a leak..which apparently has happened to almost everyone who  has bought this thing. Do not  purchase this toy, it takes up too much space, and it's a waste of money. Baby could care less about it
Loved this DVD because it's useful on so many levels for my Spanish class.  Can use it for cultural discussions of music, social issues, history of Cuba, current policies toward Cuba, etc.  Most expecially, kids like music and the life stories of the musicians are quite moving.  Also, for the beginning student, many of the singers' dialogs are also not too hard for them to follow
The Dictators are incredible. Few bands can alternativly spoof and embrace the rock 'n' roll ideals as these guys have, and their Spinal-Tap-meets-Ramones-mees-Beach-Boys style almost always works - almost. "Manifest Destiny" is a dissapointing release from the 'Tators. I mean its not a bad album, but the guys can do much better than this. There are a few good songs. "Disease" is hilarious, particulary the spoken word act from Handsome Dick at the begining. "Science Gone Too Far" is one of the band's catchiest tunes, proving they were as good as any of the big names from the 60s. Their closing cover of the Stooges' "Search & Destroy" is an okay interperatation of the classic. However, that's about it. The rest are mostly humorless FM-style rockers, and while the Dictators weren't selling out, they were certainly trying to become more accesible. Download those three tunes, and pick up every other album by the band
This gem of a magazine covers common sense topics of interest to health concsious readers, primarily young adult women. Feature  articles cover topics on "fitness" (body), relationships and feelings ("mind"), "food", and "guidance" on specific health problems. The articles are well written and well researched. It contains delicious easy-to-make healthy recipes, beauty hints, as well as adventurous exercise options.  ---  --- Some examples of great articles in the July-August 2004 issue are, the "hike through history" article, the "one minute moves" and the "water workout" article. The first describes hiking trails in different regions of the country, for instance, "Chesapeake & Ohio Canal National Park" in Washington, D.C., "D & L Trail (norhtern portion) in Carbon County Pennsylvania, and "Railroad Grade Trail" in Apache Country, Arizona.

Overall, this magazine is highly recommended for women readers of all ages. Erika Borsos (erikab93
I actually didn't mind Kiss The Girls because of Morgan Freeman. He saved the day in that movie. Plus, I'm always intrigued by serial killers and weird psychos. That always peaks my interest. But Ashley Judd's performance was just terrible in that (not that I think she's very good in anything I've seen but whatever). That's why I was delighted to find another thriller along those lines with Morgan Freeman, still playing Alex Cross, but thankfully without Ashely Judd (a better name for her would be Ashely Dudd but that's my opinion). Along Came A Spider was not only an interesting storyline, it was also very well acted. There's some twists of course which I won't spoil, but one I did see coming and the other blindsided me. All in all very enjoyable, especially for the low price I found this at. The little girl who is kidnapped in this, played by Mika Boorem, is terrific. It was kind of neat seeing her in this as I had just watched the movie Sleepover recently (also reviewed it...cute little movie...check it out) where she's more grown up. Hopefully we'll be seeing more things with her. Anyway, I found this engrossing enough and most times you can't go wrong with Morgan Freeman (except if Ashely Judd is in a scene with him, but that's not his fault) as he's an exceptional actor. Obsessed with serial killers, psychos and the like, just as I am? Then you will have a good time getting tangled up in the web of Along Came A Spider
Mini DV cams are better, and should cost about the same. This particular camera has poor quality video and it is a pain to get video transferred to your computer. The software is glitchy, so you'll probably end up downloading drivers yourself. Find a different camera
I just recieved my shoes today and can't believe that these shoes fit perfectly. The wide size 8.5 is just what I needed. I am already wearing these shoes with no break in required as I would often have with other shoes. I love the value as I purchased these for only $19.79.  --- 
Look...to be fair, one man's BOTE is another man's "Manos". What I mean by that is some people may love this ep, but I personally didn't find it very funny and the movie is so bad that the sub-average riffing doesn't save it. The best lines that Mike & the robots make are when they speak for a character and add a line to something a person says. Unfortunately, the feature's horrible pacing, slow dialogue scenes, and atrocious acting are not enough, and it seems like the writers took a break on this one. Of course, even weak MST3K is better than pretty much any other show, but I must say this is certainly my least favorite episode from season 5 and at times feels like a Season 1 episode (the riffing is sparse and not really funny). If you are a newcomer and would like to see this show at it's best, get either "Manos: Hands of Fate" or "Red Zone Cuba"
Wasted hours trying unsuccessfully to install the driver for the IOGEAR GIC251U 5-port USB card on a Dell Optiplex GX-1 running 98SE. (This computer already has 2 USB 1.1 ports.) The main problem is that the Add Hardware Wizard does not find a *.inf file in the IOGEAR-supplied CD folder and does not recognize the executable program that is in the CD folder. User has to cancel out of the wizard and execute the driver installation file as a stand-alone program. This results in installation of drivers that show up in the Device Manager. However, the installation wizard comes up at every subsequent reboot and the user must cancel out of it just to get the computer going. ---  --- Installed card seemed to work OK for a D-Link wireless adapter, but did not recognize a digital camera that was satisfactorily recognized by one of the non-IOGEAR 1.1 ports. The following actions did not help. (1) swapping the card to another PCI slot, (2) downloading and installing more recent driver file from IOGEAR website, (3) three calls to customer support, where I found sympathy but so solution
This is a great drink. I wanted to try something that was different, and this definately fit in. It isnt carbonated, and tastes really good. ---  --- What I really wanted to know though, was how it worked. There is no caffeine or taurine, and the ingredients list didnt really show anything out of the ordinary. ---  --- It worked well though, and I was able to stay focused for a long time after drinking it
I haven't read them all, but it seems to me that most of the reviews here are about film technique. In addition to being ground-breaking from a director's standpoint, it's a great story. I've seen the Richard Gere version, and frankly, all I remember about it is the MTV music video for the theme song. The original gave me a completely different perception of the story, and the ending surprised me. I thought Jean-Paul Belmondo did a fantastic job with a complex character. There's a press conference scene that I thought was important to the story, as well. I wish I spoke French, because I think there are nuances in the dialogue not captured in the subtitles, but nevertheless, I think this is an enjoyable film in addition to all the cinematic masterpiece accolades. ---   --- 
I got a few packages of these... used some for my daughter (for the Omega-3 fatty acids, as they help with brain function... she is speech impaired) and for my grandpa (who has high blood pressure & had a stroke.) --- You simply add a few spoonfuls to your oatmeal... my grandpa's cholesterol went down 50 points in one month. (None of his medication had been able to do that.)  --- My 5 y.o. daughter didn't notice this in her oatmeal... I tried it, and there is no added taste, just health benefits :)  --- Great product. We always have it at our house
'Torzók' ('Abandoned') is a brilliant Hungarian film written and directed by Árpád Sopsits that takes us back to Hungary of 1960 when the oppressive Communist rule altered the lives of everyone, especially children.  The quality of the film is absolutely first rate from story to acting to filming to scoring.  It may be a tough film to absorb and certainly not for the easily offended, but it is a perfectly honed gem of a film that deserves wide audience exposure. ---  --- Áron (Tamás Mészáros) is a young lad whose life seems warm at first until suddenly a disease of vision impairment attacks his mother and his parents divorce: the mother is somewhere in a hospital and the father (Sándor Gáspár) beats the boy and eventually turns him over to a rigid orphanage for boys run by cruel taskmasters.  Áron undergoes initiation tactics by his fellow orphans but despite the beatings he is strong enough to survive.  He is befriended when he has his nightmares about his mother's blindness by his friend Atilla (Szabolcs Csizmadia) and the two bond emotionally and physically. In this bleak atmosphere a little light comes from the beautiful young housekeeper Anya (Krisztina Somogyi) but even her contributions are compromised by the cruelty of the staff.  There is one 'teacher' in the orphanage school, Nyitrai (László Gálffi) who has been reduced to his position as an 'imprisoned one' by the government and his sadness is offset by his playing his cello and studying his beloved astronomy. Nyitrai offers  Áron solace and introduces his 'fellow traveler' to the glory of the stars, giving Áron a map of the heavens that Áron cherishes - his window to a world beyond the dark confines of his prison-like orphanage.  He gradually wins over his fellow orphans and when Nyitrai, in the pit of depression for his life situation and the cruelty of the orphanage and the government, hangs himself. This horrid incident drives Áron to organize an escape from the orphanage, an event that is ultimately fractured with a death for which Áron feels responsible. And the end of the film fades into the many possibilities that event could trigger. ---  --- The atmosphere created by the stunning cinematography by Péter Szatmári defines the darkness that represents the orphanage well but also suggests the darkness in Hungary of that period.  The musical score by Péter Fejcsik, Tamás Görgényi, Ferenc Toma, and Balázs Winkler is some of the most beautiful composed for the screen, making tremendously effective use of the cello and lower strings.  In all, this is a brilliant piece of filmmaking, acted with depth in every role, and unveiling a portion of history and tragedy too often pushed to the background of our books.  Highly Recommended.

One shoe did not fit properly--also didn't think the sole would be comfortable for all day walking
It is reasonably accurate. The numbers displayed are formed irregularly. You can't zero it out by zeroing one category i.e. Distance. The price is reflective of its quality
I simply spent time watchnig this French response to a Chaplin-style but non-silent motion picture. ---  --- Maybe, it was a top at the timing of the making.
I would not buy it!  Hard to use. My machine runs slower since the install. 
We are very disappointed in this product we purchased last summer.  We constantly have many kids and adults of all ages over to our house because of our swimming pool and I don't think we have found one person who has done more than try it once then walk away.  Also it is difficult to find the right size to hang it becasue of different sized people using it.  Not recommended
Once again, Koch, for reasons that I cannot possibly fathom, assumed that people would enjoy this movie more if the brilliant story and dialog weren't being constantly interrupted by those annoying sex scenes. I know I'm feeling large amounts of gratitude. It's gratitude when you want to disembowel someone, right? ---  --- At least the copy I bought was used, so Koch didn't make a dime off of me. Anyway, this is another Koch release that you should definitely avoid
This lip gloss smells good, goes on slick and stays on a long time. Great value for the price. I love Philosophy products. They're all great
A great idea, in theory, but I think this is a very poor design.  The wing nuts do not tighten sufficiently to hold the strings in place - they just spin around and around.  I will be able to get it working, with a bit of work and a few bits and pieces from around the house, but if I had given this to a child for Christmas I would feel awful about it..
This is perfect for any stop-motion animator. With over 30 posable joints, Thoron is inexpensive compared to other figures.Also, Thoron's nemosis,Stendhal, is a great figure for animation
I have a three year old son, he loves these take along toys. We take them every where with us. The tracks stay together very well we move them from room to room and never have to take them apart. We have almost every part of the Take Along Thomas the Train items
I love to hear old standards and such.  But I like to hear people who put their own take on it.   I can't stand to hear cheesy big band arrangements with some Frank Sinatra wannabe.  Where are the male versions of Nora Jones?   Tone down the cheese!  We need more people like sophisticated Shirley Horn and Betty Carter(NOT hams like Buble, Dusk, or boring singers like Diana Krall.  But what can I expect from the music industry?  Rarely do the best song-stylists get lots of attention.  So, hmmm, nevermind.  I guess it's always been that way
La Grange is probably at the top of most ZZ Top fans lists, and rightly so as it is superb, but the version contained on this collection is the one where they did some weird digital reverb stuff to the drum track, which completely destroyed the roadhouse vibe of the original recording.  It is so awful that I don't know how anybody can listen to it.  Thankfully they got smart and went back to the original for Rancho Texicano.  Clueless classic rock stations are still playing the version contained here, dummies. ---  --- Also, Waitin' on the Bus/Jesus Just Left Chicago are two absolutely essential tracks that are inexplicably missing here
Very disappointing.  The shower head itself is massive - the size of a small dinner plate.  It is attached to a long hose which is so flexible it can't support the weight of the head when the shower is in use.  Predictably, when you turn on the shower, the head drops groundward, spewing water in a horizontal spray.  Installs easily, but save your money
ORDERED A MELITTA 10 CUP COFFEE MAKER AND ON THE SAME PAGE WAS AN AD FOR THE MELITTA FILTERS.........THEY WERE VERY EXPENSIVE AND WHEN THEY ARRIVED THEY WERE NOT FOR A 10 CUP MELITTA................. --- I ADVISED THE COMPANY BUT MY COMPLAINT WENT TO DEAD EARS ! ---  --- BUY YOUR FILTERS AT THE LOCAL STORE........THEY ARE CHEAPER
Maiden had evolved into a new metal standard in 1986. Not only did they lead the metal world with the greatest artwork on covers, but their music took a new form and justifed everything they had done in the past. Iron Maiden to Powerslave were just the stepping stones to this standard classic.  ---  The CD Starts out with CAUGHT SOMEWHERE IN TIME, a galloping bassline, and parallel guitar make it, not only a classic, but ahead of its time. The rest of the CD id in pure form. My favorite track, however, is ALEXANDER THE GREAT. The intro starts out with a whisper of that era, and slowly builds to the howl of, I feel, the battle cry of the great warrior of History.  ---  Iron Maiden did not dissapoint with this CD. It is very well mixed and produced, and remains a standard in my collection of CD's.
The chenille cover is very soft and nice to the touch, however, it does not allow for the cold from the gelpack to penetrate.   --- The 1 star rating is only for using this product as a cold pack.  I had intended to use it as a cold mask only.  
The product works great. What i didn't like was not having the attachment to charge the battery in my home. It only came with the cigarette lighter power source. I had to purchase the other power source seperately. I also had purchased the 3000 model previously and it came with both power sources. Why is that
Thank you for this Great Gift for a baby shower States away that you made helpful and she loves i
I purchased the set of two Park Smart parking mats as a simple alternative to hanging a tennis ball on a string which would hit the windshield when my car was sufficiently inside the garage to close the door. But even with stickum on the bottom the mats slipped on the smooth floor of the garage and the car hit the workbench time and again. I may say the service I got through amazon.com was first rate; it's the product I found wanting
We use our videocameras to tape preschool classrooms for observations.  The hope was to use the microphone to isolate conversations. --- To test the microphone.  I went to a Noisy Starbucks, huge lines, moderate music and tons of conversations.  I recorded on the video cameras mics, then used the zoom mic then used the gun feature.  I aimed the microphone at the barista yelling out the coffee orders.  In all instances, there was no difference in sound quality.   --- I then went to the Sony Style Store in the Mall and had her open a different Microphone and allowed her to install it. She read the package from a distance and then we listened to it in all three settings.  We could not find any difference.   --- I checked the camera instructions and there was no setting for the external mic.  Once the mic is attached and turned on, the external mic is suppose to override the on board mic.   ---  --- I am still insearch for a gun mic for a digital camera.  Many of the new camcorders with hard drives and DVD drives do not have a MIC input or Active Interface Shoe.  I would rather want a MIC input so that I can use a more powerful mic rather than being at the mercy of Sony to create one for their shoe.   ---  --- Overall, I am stuck.  If I record something interesting I will probably have to try to enhance the audio portion while editing.  (The camera shots great video
I thought the case was nice looking, but when actually using it, I was very dissapointed.  The case is not secure at all, it keeps sliding off.  If you have the little clip on iPod shuffle, I do not recommend the aluminum case
As Crow puts it, if it had not snowed on that Monday in March.  The snow led to a chain of circumstances with Crow bringing a homeless teenager home for dinner and a place to stay for the night.  It turns out that the teenager, Lloyd, was a witness to a crime, and that draws Tess into the case when she connects Lloyd to a news reporter.  Events disrupt her life as the case develops and federal agents demand that she reveal the name of the source.  The story starts with a narration by Crow, and alternates between Crow, Tess, and other characters in the story.  You will get a lot more Crow in this novel than in others.  The story has an interesting ending, and you can wonder if Lloyd will show up again.  You get some information along the way about Baltimore soup kitchens and the homeless, and a view of the underside of society where life is sometimes cheap
ITS BEEN MONTHS AND I STILL HAVE NOT RECIEVED MY COPY OF  THIS MAGAZINE.  THEY HAD NO PROBLEM CHARGING MY CREDIT CARD, BUT THEY CANT SEEM TO GET A COPY OF THIS WEEKLY MAGAZINE OUT IN UNDER A QUATER OF A YEAR. WHAT A BUNCH OF NONESENSE.
I like this scent. My first thought was pears, before reading what the notes were, yes, apples. This is not a hardcore apple scent, but enough so. ---  --- Very fresh and sweet but not too sweet. Crisp and spring-like. A hint, a tiny hint of dandelions and a tiny bit of rose, just a tiny bit.  ---  --- My husband likes this scent on me as well, which is saying a lot. He hates roses and foody scents, but still likes this.
The jack doesn't fit in the hole of the phone on the Motorola V173. Don't know about V170/
I own several great digital cameras. It seems like I get one for each use - one with good zoom, another camera for its good flash use in lowlight and others. This one I wanted for the high MP in a small compact size that I can put into my pocket. The first few photos were great, taken outdoors in my sunny patio. Then every picture I took after that (same settings - fine, HQ, poster 10m etc... and vertical lines started showing on the LCD screen and the pictures were all washed out. When I download them on the computer, they look exactly that way too - with the lines and almost all white. I've played around with the settings (and I do know how to work them) but still it does the same. --- So time to return to find a better one. That's too bad since I read some good reviews and wanted to have it
My tracfone has good reception. i like that it has free call waiting and free caller id. if you haven't activated your tracfone yet then the 'refer a friend program' will give each of us 100 free minutes. please send me an email and i will send you a fast referral. it's a win/win! thanks 
Boots are very, very, dark brown, look nothing like the picture, fit poorly, an item that has to be fitted before purchasing
I bought these for a bridal shower gift. They say one size fits all but they where like an XXXSmall. They torn right when they where tried on. VERY POOR QUALITY!!!! DO NOT BUY THESE
Four Brothers is yet another nail in the coffin of John Singleton's increasingly moribund moviemaking career.  The director - who burst upon the scene in 1991 with the vibrant and gritty "Boyz n the Hood" - has here mounted a film so burdened by implausibility and contrivance that it makes one wonder if the once-promising filmmaker will ever be able to get back on track again.  The story, reeking of artificiality, features Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin and Garrett Hedlund as four troubled young men raised by the same foster mother.  When she is killed in a convenience store robbery, the quartet launches into action, seeking revenge against the perpetrators and becoming slowly convinced, through their investigation in the neighborhood, that the killing might not have been as random in nature as they had been initially led to believe.   ---  --- The main weakness of this film is that it gives us virtually no reason to care about any of the characters.  By not showing us any scenes between the boys and their foster mother (except for one embarrassingly bad Thanksgiving dinner fantasy sequence that looks as if it were conceived by a first-year film student), we are forced to take their relationship totally on faith, rendering the boys' thirst for revenge arbitrary at worst and academic at best. ---  --- The acting is uniformly flat, with the characters little more than wafer-thin stereotypes, and even the action scenes come across as surprisingly mundane and second-rate given the Singleton pedigree in this area.  The boys' running around from venue to venue in their Detroit neighborhood, brandishing guns in full view of the populace and screaming for information about their mother's killer, is ludicrous on the face of it and often reduces the film to the level of cheap low comedy burlesque.   ---  --- With nary a single moment that rings believable or true, "Four Brothers" is by-the-book filmmaking from a director who has proven that he has the wherewithal and talent to do so much more.
I was going to buy these until I saw that they contained trans fats (partially hydrogenated vegetable oil in Cocoa Crispies, Fruit Loops, and Corn Pops).  Who wants to send their kids off to school loaded up with deadly trans fats? 
Great smell. Worth the cost. Cleans great. I have used this laundry soap for quite some time now and happy.
My mother bought me a gift subscription when I moved in to my first apartment. I love this magazine. I pass the recipies on to family and friends, who have enjoyed them as well. The simple solutions to everyday needs are extremely helpful and well worth the $30 or so for a subscription. I am buying it for a housewarming present for a friend this week.
I love the workout dvd that comes with it - but the ball developed a slow leak after only a few uses.  Very disappointed with this product
With the entire market for rocker and wobble boards so overpriced for what you get, it's nice to see that you can get a quality product without paying 50%+ more.  Solidly built of high strength plastic/resin and rubber, I find this board much stronger and more comfortable than the wood ones.  I even told my chiropractor that the Thera-Band was better than what he had in his office that his supplier wanted to charge me $75 for.  It even comes with a nice brochure outlining the various exercises you can do with the board
This software now constantly tries to get you to upgrade to a "better" package - the schedule C for small business.  I used to like TurboTax, but it has really gotten to be a pain.  ---  --- And finally, I spent two days trying to e-file, always getting a Server busy message from Intuit.  This is AFTER they got my credit card number and $34. to file the fed and state tax returns.  So I had to hand assemble the return and make the trip to the Post Office.  Intuit lobbied the Gov to let them keep this big $$$ plum, and then screwed it up.  They had this same problem last year, and it is WORSE this year. Time to call all our representatives and get E-File FREE from the IRS.  It saves the IRS money, far more than it costs.  Why is Intuit allowed to suck this much more from us after making big profits on the package
This will be a present for my nephew George's 37th birthday. He loved --- Curious George as a child, and still does. It's wonderful how someone --- carries a love for a childhood toy, book, etc. throughout their life. --- Such an individual eternally has a special spot in their heart --- Kudos to Amazon for providing the book for $5.00 under market price.
If you liked the original then you will also like KH2. It finishes the story nicely. Battle commands are improved - I especially like the Reaction commands. Still has some camera issues. Overall a good game
I have a waterpik that I've used for years. After a while the tips will break. Try finding them in a store- NOT! --- Welcome Amazon! They have the WaterPik Replacement Tips for a reasonable price. If you go to Waterpik online they double the price due to shipping!!! ---  --- Amazon ROCKS
A love story between a couple that does not want to bein love. Very good book, like all that I've read from this author.
Owning 2 mercedes, it is a pain to drain normally.  Using the MityVac, you insert the hose, pump the vacuum and it draws out the oil.  My only problem has been a loose seal at the top of the lid.  The resulting leak requires additional pumping to create more vacuum.  Still, it is definitely easier than lifting the car and crawling underneath to drain it. ---  --- I also tried on my truck engine and differential and found it easy to use.  It was a real time saver on the differential since I did not have to break the gasket for the cover
I liked this game. I mean Final Fantasy VII is still the god final fantasy game but this was ok
A one star rating for this toy is way to charitable. The car does nothing but jerk, and thats only when repeatedly hitting the button. Disney should be a shame of themselves for marketing this toy! Surely they had to have an idea about their product's poor performance. My advice is everyone should print off the reviews from Amazon and all like it. With this in hand, march into Disney stores and demand (1) their money back (2) an apology. The only thing less reliable than this was my 1991 GMC Jimmy
The TH watch was a dream watch to the person it was gifted to. It was bought for a friend and he just loved it.
After owning a P-touch labeler for years,I found the need for a more duable label than my "M" tape was providing. I opted for this "TZ" tape labeler. Good price,looks good. What a mistake!!! The only thing well designed about this unit is it's abilty to waste more tape than it uses!! If you print a label of any size,count on it costing you two full inches of tape to do it!!! At $20.00 a roll,prepare to be screwed each time you push the print button.Then go find the scissors and cut the excess off,so the label does not look as stupid as the person who designed this pile of junk!!! But cheer up you can push six buttons,every time,to reduce the margin to "narrow". This will reduce the waste to a half inch on ONE side of the label,and print two small dots on the other side,this will show you where to cut it with your scissors,to match the "narrow" side. Also you must do ALL settings for EVERY label EVERY time!!Another "great feature,it will use the same amount of tape regaurdless of print size,so you will only print large print.What a joke!!! What a hassle!! Now the good news. I used to make lots of labels,and now I only make labels for VERY important items. And only when I am up to getting mad for doing so. I really wish amazon would allow us to give items a negative five stars! You have been warned
My original order was 1 pair of tennis shoes missing so when I had to re-order the 2nd pair of identical tennis shoes, I was overcharged & also had to pay shipping fees again. I tried several times to resolve this problem via Amazon & the shipping co. Bealls Florida, but was basically ignored & never received my refund. I find this to be deceitful & poor customer service
I had high expectations for this book, but I was disappointed.  It concentrated too much on digital systems, rather than broadening the definition of noise to cover the natural environment.  I lost interested in the last 1/3 of the book, and couldn't wait to finish
It didn't meet my expectations.....It was flimsy and wrinkled, and looked messy
The "microscope" never worked at all. It is cheap plastic and very badly made. You get a few small pieces of indicator paper and a few bags of baking soda, citric acid and gelatin plus one prepared slide you will not be able to view with the "microsope". ---  --- Very disappointing. The Discovery Channel kits are better value. Don't waste your money on this kit
This is a great value - probably one of the best shower heads I've used. Yes - there are better ones for $100+, but this is absolutely amazing
Although glass, they do look like opals, and have a lovely irridescent qualit
I've been pleased with both the quantity and quality of the bubbles, but the scent fades rather quickly.  If the scent lasted longer, it would be much improved
I have tried many types of stainless steel cleaners.  This is the best I have found.  I actually saw it in a dept store and they were USING it for the cleaner.  It was not available for purchase there.  I have only found it on line.  It is well worth the price.  Several of my friends and neighbors have switched to it now too.  It really cleans, without streaks.  It lasts a long time too.  Love my stainless, but it requires a good cleaning product like this one
This is a great software for Photographers looking for a faster way to manager and edit images. I gave it a four because I would hope that ADOBE would still find ways to improve this product. The functionality is superb, and for such a great program, it doesn't eat too much memory on your computer (I have a 4 year old PC with 768 MB of RAM). And because of this I'm shooting more pictures in RAW format and not worry about the time I spend in front of the computer. ---  --- I'll definitely be buying the next upgrade
Though I own alot of Paul Desmond recordings, this one as been in the CD changer for weeks now.  There's great, gentle interplay with Jim Hall, and a total sound that is most enjoyable.  Warm and round notes make this  perfect evening music which I have found pleases most everyone
I purchased these so I wouldn't slip on my sticky mat when my hands sweat.  However, they didn't work well for this purpose because there is only one elastic strip that goes between your first and second finger and it allows your hands to slip right through the yoga paws.  Additionally, after only a few classes, the sticky material started coming off of the yoga paws, particularly on the foot paws.  I guess they would be okay for someone who doesn't ever have sweaty palms and who doesn't do any intense postures.  Otherwise, I would recommend doing what I do now - use a pair of weight lifting gloves with a leather/suede palm for extra traction on your sticky mat
What a disjointed mess, talk about cashing in on fame.  All he did here was take a bunch of columns he wrote in the paper and called it a book.   I could have done better with the letter to the editor section of the paper.  I was not that enamored with Liar's Poker and this book has done it for me with this author.   It was just that the articles were not that relevant any more and his writing is not that good
There is a reason this mitt is relatively cheap. The shape of it is very strange. It does not fit my hands at all. I have fairly wide hands and this mitt feels very ackward. It is tight to get into and the thumb is too short. I would return it except the postage would cost me more than the mitt did. I would suggest you buy in person someplace where you can put your hands in it first.
I bought this deck about 6 months ago. It has performed flawless in every aspect. As soon as I turned it on I could notice a big difference in the sound quality from my old poineer deck. I have taken all of my cd's out of my truck because there is no need for the cd player if you take advantage of the ipod interface. The ipod function is flawless and easy to use. Just plug in your ipod and search by artist, album, song title or playlist. This can get a little tricky while driving ecpecially if you have a large library so I would suggest using playlists. The output of sound quality from an ipod is amazing. Also there is a very useful bass engine that is very useful if you have subs, this function allows for flawless bass output and easy ajustment. This deck is the best overall I have ever listened to
I have had nothing short of an excellent experience with this product. I have created numerous videos of my children's escapades and sporting events. I do have one warning however. Provide the grandparents with a box of tissues because they never fail to cry when they see their little angels parading across the widescreen. The software is extremely intuitive and easy to use. My wildest expectations were exceeded.
This is a hilariously written and acted film about two young people who get carried away with the beauty of an old house only to find that it is SERIOUSLY flawed.  Tom Hanks and Shelly Long are fantastic and people who love old houses will really identify with this
It was everything it advertised as being.  I can carry my digital camera and lenses as well as two point and shoot digital cameras.  Being a slingshot backpack, my back doesn't moan and groan as it did with other camera bags.  I like the feature of swinging the bag to the front and to get my cameras with out removing the backpack
I eagerly snapped up this ionic hair dryer about over a year ago because of it's retractable cord and folding capabilities. Even the price was attractive. It really did take up little room in my bathroom drawer and the retractable cord was a plus. I thought I had the perfect blow dryer because it did what it was supposed to do and quickly. Now for the bad news:  the retractable cord became chewed up and frayed after daily use and it became apparent that the cord was ultimately going to fray completely in due time. Then, the folding handle, low and behold, broke in half one morning. (Of course, the warranty had long expired). This dryer is too fragile to consider using on a daily basis and I consider myself a careful person when it comes to handling small appliances such as hair dryers. When I've replaced hair dryers in the past, it was been because they've simply reached the end of their lifespans and burned out.  I'd caution anyone to consider this before buying because these 2 features alone, while very appealing, can shorten an otherwise good hairdryer's lifespan.  I've now purchased a T3 Tourmaline (a featherweight, quiet hairdryer with no retractable cord or folding handle) which seems to work just fine and appears to have a much longer lifespan. 
This seat, along with the matching step stool are great!  My daughter loves having her very own, special toilet seat and step for going potty.  It has encouraged her to potty train, it fits the toilet seat nicely, and is easy for her to put on the toilet by herself.  I put a suction hanger on the toilet tank and is easily put out of the way when mommy and daddy need to go potty, and she can easily get it and set it up for herself as well. 
I decided to buy this product before i read the reviews.  In my opinion the trays stay on better than the strip kind.  There is alot of whitening goo that you press into your teeth and it helps the trays stay in place.  The first morning the goo came totally out of my bottom tray but that was becuase i pressed too hard.  I havent had the problem since.   --- I noticed a difference after 3 days and they are much whiter after 7 days.  My gums turned white if the whitening goo touched them for the full 45 minutes and felt tingly and hurt slightly.  The pick color returned within an hour. It really isnt as bad as the other reviewers make it seem. --- All in all if you are looking for a product that works, this is a good one.  I was truly surprised at how well they worked.  I will be purchasing these in the future
As a fan of Gitlin, I was hoping that he'd give me the bottom line - his bottom line - on the air we breathe today, the same way that brave souls such as Lasch, Marcuse, and Bell have done.  But Gitlin isn't brave.  He admits, honestly, up front, that he will reach few conclusions, and merely wants to lay out what we face each day on the streets, on TV, and on the net.  What follows is a stream-of-consciousness depiction of life today.  I want more than that from Gitlin.  I want his conclusions, not some lame statement that he hasn't reached any yet.  He's not getting any younger.  Lots of other fabulous thinkers have failed at this stage of their lives.  It's time for his masterpiece - the next book, perhaps
This Chromatic tuner, powered by one AAA battery, has a built-in mike for acoustic instruments and a plugin for electrics.  The LCD dial shows the specific tone, lights red if too high or too low, and green when you have it just right. I have used it on several 6-string (acoustic) guitars, a 12-string and a 5-string banjo.  The results are incredible- reliable and true. --- For years, I tuned by ear. You know... 5th fret, etc.  What I didn't realize that an "E" is not just an "E" - there may be (are!) thousands of tones - all of which are "E's" - and this explains why though tuned OK by ear, one chord would sound fine while others would sound out of tune. --- This tuner fixes that. In tune is in tune. --- I have found it to be among the best (and least expensive) musical investments I have ever made - I wonder how I tolerated the way I sounded before I discovered it - let alone what others may have experienced! --- A great piece of equipment at a great price. --- I recomment it heartily
I was able to get this cable working eventually after some research on my own.  The cable itself is O.K. but I had to locate the correct drivers on my own and it's definitely not intuitive, and definitely not plug-and-play.  Support from the seller consisted of referring me to a competitor's website to locate the drivers on my own.  Also, (and with no offense intended) if you think a driver is a person behind a steering wheel then this is not the product for you
I have been impressed by tazo's China Green Tips Tea. Strong is an understatement! Great tea - I have throughly enjoyed i
my 5-year old daughter spent all day taking pictures of her and her baby sister in san francisco. we put new batteries in that morning. the next day i was wondering why the picture numbers had reset. when i tried to download the pictures to my computer, they were all gone, and the battery icon was flashing. based on what i've read here, it appears the batteries died after one day of use and the pictures were all erased. the picture quality is about the same as an old camera phone -- pretty poor, but good enough for my 5-year to enjoy. but what good is that when there aren't even any pictures the next day. i'm hoping the store will take it back
I didn't know you had to line up the arrows on the motor part so we installed it incorrectly and it rotated counterclockwise; my husband took the whole thing apart and reversed the battery terminals so that it would turn clockwise, then it worked just fine.  The instructions don't mention that you have to align the motor to the terminals in a certain fashion or it will turn backwards.  But once you get it lined up right it works fine with Hershey's syrup.  a Great starter fountain for my chocaholic 2nd grader
A quality album from Richard. Long time fans will not be disappointed. It will win over quite a few new fans as well with it great guitars and snappy lyrics
Durability seems to be an issue.  The cord breaks or unravels much too quickly.  The sleeve inside the ball becomes grooved and slows the ball's travel on the cord.  A sleeve made of a harder, slicker material would improve both ball speed and reduce cord wear.  Possible materials are hardened aluminum, stainless steel (polished), teflon-based plastic or polycarbonate
I have stopped at least 5 shops (Walmart, Sports Authority, Target, etc.) to find foosball replacements but no avail; the table was acquired at a charity auction but had no balls. ---  --- The foosballs were shipped exactly and timely as promised, and still having a lot of fun playing with family and friends
I use MS Office at work, and at home, but for my daughter's computer this was perfect.  --- Most people don't need the full version of office, and this package has so much for so little money. --- The full version of Word is reason enough to spend this amount of money. Note: This is not the latest version, but who cares. --- I would say this is one of the best software deals out there. Unless you need 100% office compatiblity, this is the package for you. If you do, buy the student and teacher version of MS Office. Read the fine print, it is for anyone not using it for business
Dear Sir/Madam: Its very difficult to email you regarding things I can't find.! Or you don't sell? I am looking for HP black ink. #20 for 656C printer. Now, you tell me which ink I need? No way you can tell.!! Because you are NOT selling or what? You site is very difficult to find Ink I need
These shoes are no longer being made in Italy but in India.  The quality of the material utilized and the construction is cheap and nothing like they used to be.  I have worn this same style of Bostonian (Marco) for several years, and was completely satisfied.  This is a cheap imitation of what used to be a great, comfortable, well-constructed shoe.  Return to having them made in Italy!  
This sucker couldn't pick up a single channel; not even one less than 10 miles away.  I live in a fairly open area
I tried to use this thing, but it just goes off no matter what - even when nothing has moved. Waste of money
I bought this lens based on the super telephoto ability and low cost. You truly get what you pay for, and this thing isn't worth a plug nickel. I took a few shots on a tripod and could not believe how terrible this lens was @ 300mm (480mm on a Digital Rebel XT). Incredibly soft. Even stopped down, I would never want to make an enlargement from it. Stay away. Don't believe the fools who are novices, you will be disappointed with this lens. You're much better off to buy the older & used 100-300mm 5.6 (the L version costs more too) but both are so much better than this junker. You're even more crazy if you think you can take decent photo's with this lens handheld. Having switched from Nikon when switching to digital, I almost judged Canon from this one lens, which I'm glad I didn't. Don't waste your money or learn the hard way like I did. This lens also had terrible purple fringing, almost as bad as the kit 18-55mm. After extensive research and testing I now own and am happy with the following Canon lenses: --- Canon 10-22mm --- Canon 28-105mm (3.5 version) --- Canon 100-300mm (5.6 non-L version) I will sell for the L version when I can afford it.  ---  --- The kit 18-55mm makes usable shots, but when I could afford it, I sold it too.  ---  --- You will get better results buying a Rebel XT and an older 100-300mm than you would with a brand new XTI and this terrible 75-300mm lens.
I like Oregon Scientific products, but their previous Atomic Alarms had quirky controls -- often leading to changing the time zone in the middle of the night rather than turning off the alarm.  This one's lots better! ---  --- The projection feature works OK, though doesn't really focus sharply at the close distances I'd prefer to use.  The eight minute snooze alarm is great -- just the right interval! ---  --- Overall, a nice, useful, moderately expensive alarm clock
Bought this camera to replace my 35mm camera.  Am pleased with the trade up that I made. ---  --- The shape is similar to my old film camera.  Thought this would make it easier to adjust to the smaller size of it.  It has made the transition relatively smooth.  I'm sure there are smaller cameras out there, but this one is small enough.  The display is also a good size - bigger than most that I looked at. ---  --- I am not a genius at computers, so I was concerned that I would need to adapt to downloading pictures from the camera to the PC.  But, all I need to do is plug in the cord and click a button.  Very easy to follow any instructions. ---  --- I did notice that the display "freezes" for a second or two after a picture is taken.  This is not generally a problem for me as most pictures are posed shots.  I did run into some lag time during an Easter egg hunt this past weekend, but still managed to get about a dozen good shots. ---  --- Overall, I like the camera and only wish I had gotten up the courage to go digital sooner
I was disappointed in this video.  I came to it not as a devout Catholic but as a fan of travel videos.  In other words, I watched this video with the same motivation I would have to watch Shackleton's Antarctic exploration, or something from the Globe Trekker series. ---  --- With that in mind, the target audience for this video is not me.  It is the religious Catholic.  Therefore, from my perspective, I can't recommend it.  I'm not one for all the pomp and circumstance of religion.  I don't enjoy worshipping the "Holy Father", or watching the construction of the clownish uniform of the Swiss Guard. ---  --- If you are a devout Catholic you will probably enjoy this video.  If you are not, and just came to the video because you wanted a Globe Trekker style tour of the Vatican, you are likely to be disappointed. ---  --- And that is what these reviews are for - to let you know whether you will enjoy the video or not
I am a novice photographer, so take this with a grain of salt...  I just bought this kit and it included no instructions and lots of components.  I suppose if you are accustomed to using these kits, putting them together must seem self-explanatory.  If you are new to these kits you will find it frustrating.  It is also frustrating to discover Smith Victor does not have a support site (just references on photography).  They do not even provide a support # or address.  Keep all this in mind when considering something from this company
Another great Richard Scarry video.  This video teaches kids in a way that is interesting and fun for them...without being obnoxious for their parents!  We love it
This book is great. A must read for anyone who has struggled with weight or health problems.
We like this car seat for the price we paid. Likes: love the easily adjustable belts - we often let the straps out a lot to get her in it without her being uncomfortable and then tighten it appropriately. The 5 point harness is great. Love that the car seat is compatible with different strollers. Dislikes: It doesn't recline as much as we'd like and the head padding is superficial. Our baby's head tends to fall forward a lot. The sun canopy seems like it was designed as an afterthought - it certainly works more than adequately, but doesn't move easily. Finally, the handle is difficult to move from position to position. Overall though, for the price, it's a good seat.
This was the perfect TV for our needs:  It fits the space, is economical, has great picture size and quality, and lots of features.  It is a good blend of current digital and CRT technology.  Not an LCD and bulky as they come, but once in place it delivers a quality viewing experience.
 This kit is very poorly detailed, and matches the filming miniatures only in the sense of the basic overall profile being pretty close. ---  ---  There's a MUCH better model of an X-Wing out there. Do a web search for a company called "Fine Molds"... it's a Japanese company that makes a finely-detailed 1/72 scale X-Wing that is modeled directly from the filming miniatures, including parts to build different ships from the original film's Death Star battle, including standing & seated pilot figures & different droid types. ---  ---  It's a bit more expensive than this kit, but you get what you pay for. 
Do not buy this mattress, it is not safe.  This mattress does not fit either of the cribs we have for our twins.  When I called Kolcraft to inform them, the CS rep was rude and insistent that this mattress was standard size and would fit, and that they haven't had any complaints.  She also implied it was my crib that was the wrong size.  We have 2 cribs and the sealy matress in the crib the twins still share fits nice and snug.  The Kolcraft has at least an inch gap and can move around quite easily
Don't believe the marketing Kodak does.  I was using only Kodakfilms for nearly 5 years.  I recently switched to Fuji based on some online reviews...I was pleasantly surprised at the results.  I highly recommend this film
Really strange cardboard mushy texture. Flavor can be sickening at times, but you get used to it. I won't buy this again. I am not sure this is even beef, has a strange taste. Not sure where the other reviews came from??
i hate this phone.  i moved to miami and cannot get reception anywhere. it  cuts me off the minute i enter any building so i am stuck standing outside to talk.  i had to get a land line for the first time in over 5 years because i cannot use it in my apartment, so i am wasting tons of money on a land line with overpriced long distance rates.  but here's the thing:  other people on verizon using a different brand phone like LG have absolutely no problem!  they actually get a couple bars of reception, whereas i always have one or none at all.  i returned the phone and all they could do was give me another just like it... with all the same problems.  i actually had over 30 dropped calls in one month.  i am now stuck with it for the next 2 years unless i want to purchase another one for full price.  on top of that, people are right when they say the battery life is ridiculous.  unless you never talk on it, the battery wears out in a hurry.  and the volume buttons on the side are very hard to use when talking.  i usually end up putting it on speaker phone by accident.  i am trying to decide which is the lesser of two evils.. chucking this one in the drawer and purchasing a different one, or wasting money on a land line.  whatever you do, don't get suckered in by it's cute pink color, because underneath it's pretty exterior it's junk
Craig Cockran has reprized his first work with a text that is as rich as it is inspiring. Detail oriented, yet captivating and simple to read, this book belongs in the library of anyone who is invested in the QI process or just starting a QI program. The writer has once again shown a unique grasp of business and the instructional process. I look forward to the next installment from this outstanding author
I found a case that's almost exactly like this one, except it's $10 cheaper. ---  --- It's made by Samsonite.  model # TM90BLU (there is also a black case).  but like I said, exact same thing.  Unless you care about your camera case saying "lumix", save yourself some dough and get the one from Wal-mart
This camera is simply amazing!  I started out with a Canon G2, and then a Canon G6, and then a Canon 20D, and now this Canon 1D Mark II N.  I debated and researched for 3 months between the 1DS Mark II, 5D, and 30D.  My decision was primarily narrowed down to the 5D and this 1D Mark II N.  Yes, I wish this camera was a full-frame and also shared the 12.8 MP like the 5D, but you know what?  It practically killed me trying to weigh the pros and cons and finally I made my decision to go with this one and I'm 110% glad that I did.   ---  --- For me, this camera is definitely THE ONE to get because the 45 point Focusing, 8.5 fps, and the 1D Pro Body/Interface/Menu/Layout, etc is what really makes this camera worth it and the deciding factor.  Trust me, if you don't know how seriously fast the 8.5 fps really is, you need to go out to your camera store and try it out before you decide.  Because of this 8.5fps alone, I'm actually able to capture a lot of shots that I normally get lucky getting with my 20D.  And with a 5D at 3fps, I just said forget it...No way.  I'm not even a professional taking pictures for a living.  This is just purely a fun hobby for me and stepping up from a 20D to this camera is out of this world.  With the phenomenal auto focusing, additional metering, it's like I'm now playing with a Bentley (with the 1D MK2 N) coming from a Mercedes C230 Hatchback (The cheapest Mercedes that people buy just because it's a Mercedes name and they don't want to spend any more money on a real Mercedes).  This camera and the photos truly almost help me take pictures like a pro.   ---  --- Also, I don't shoot action pictures all the time, and I do love portrait photography, and landscapes and printing and blowing up large sized pictures.  But even with the 1.3 crop factor, there is still a HUGE improved difference going from a 1.6 crop and you won't have vignetting problems with some lenses that you'll have on a 5D.  With this 1D MK2 N, you can still take wonderful wedding photography, landscapes, etc.  As much as I'd like to have 12.8MP like the 5D, 8MP is really all that we need these days unless you're going to blow up and print photos that are larger than 8X10's or around there.  Unless you're printing extremely large posters and whatnot, you can pretty much do everything with this camera that the 5D can.  The resolution and MP is definitely enough.  Plus, it's also invaluable to know that you have the 8.5 fps available and ready to use if you need to and you can also tone it down and use a slower fps if you need to.  The extra bonuses with this camera which I look at as a secondary positive, are the weather seals, pro-build high quality construction body, easy to use and navigate menu system, you can see the iso information in the viewfinder as well as the lcd screen at all times, dual memory card capability, you can shoot on 2 memory cards at the same time as one for backup or use 2 separate cards independently, built-in battery grip (you don't have to shell out extra for this), longer battery life than the other cameras, best customization and most options that you can set to your liking, more than the 5D or the 20D or 30D.  I could go on and on but definitely get this camera if you can afford it.  Otherwise, the 5D is also a great choice too if you need to save the money, and all you do is take landscape pictures all day long, or never will have a use for fast action or have a need to capture quick moments, and don't want the fast and most accurate focusing system that's great for ai servo. 
This durable grill mat does an excellent job.  The product's material absorbs grease without burning or warping.  In my opinion, what I like best about it is that it catches and holds the majority of solid particles which fall from the grill (which turn into hard-to-clean stains just as often as grease).  It is very easy to clean.  I highly recommend this product
Title says it all.  Phone falls out.  Clip swivels badly.  Just --- trash
I bought this 3 in 1 for my fiance' because he loves banana stuff.  We were both very pleased with it.  It does smell just like bananas.  I'm hoping philosophy will come out with a body souflee in the scent soon
Product is a must for BBQ buffs. Have nothing but good things to say RE Amazon merchants
I had my Pink iPod mini since Feb. 2005. It was fine until it died the next year on the exact day I got it, and the warranty ran out. I got it repaired at an Apple reseller, and then it died again  on the warranty expiration date. What is it with the iPods? It's like they have a self destruct inside! ):-
Authentic taste, long shelf life in your fridge, easy to use, and the price is right.  How can you go wrong.  When I prepare a curry with this I don't go crazy with a lot of Thai ingredients other than the curry paste.  Just some veggies from the super like bell pepper, scallions, carrots, jalapeno and serrano chilies, and some sliced pork or chicken or beef.  So easy and so delicious
I bought Calvin Klein For Women parfum as a Christmas gift to my sister. To see the smile on her face at Christmas when she opened her gift, was priceless. As for the cost, it was much less than the department stores at the local mall's. Thank you Amazon for a great deal!
Along with the "Ultimate Jordan" DVD, this is a must buy for all Jordan fans.  While the Ultimate Jordan set has all of his earlier hits; Come Fly With Me, Above and Beyond, etc., this DVD packs in the accolades of his final year as a Chicago Bull.  There are more interviews and more candid insights with Jordan compared with his earlier videos.  The sound and video quality are top notch as well
After reading Tuesday's with Morrie, I was curious to see how different Morrie in His Own Words was from Mitch Albums Tuesday's.  After reading both, I preferred the lessons straight from the horses mouth. Morrie'
I have had .Mac for years and enjoyed using its functions.  I have a number of photo pages hosted as well as some iWeb sites.  Plus I use it for syncing and backup, etc.  I am not a power user, however.  But it's a great utility and particularly when you have other family members who you want to have access it some of its features easily. 
Great price, good product, escellent service.  I will buy from this supplier again
Very happy with the lens, and the price is definately right for an amateur like myself
If this album didn't come out at its destinated time, 2006 would have been one of the worst years for gospel music.  Outside of Kurt Carr's cd, this album makes singing gospel music worthwhile.  Donald Lawrence knows how to send out a group and bring in a new era of singers.  That's basically what this finale does, it brings into the forefront the future of the gospel music scene.  We have new artists emerging in Blanche (McAlister-not sure if she is going to just do the first name like MaDonna, Cher, Mandisa, ummmmm, think about it!!!!!!!!), DeWayne Woods (thanks for the testimony and great Sunday morning rocking song - this is hint to all church musicians sing this song when church is a lil dead and pick it up), The Murrills, LaJeune Thompson (sang girl), and Sheri from the duo of Ted & Sheri.  There are so many hits on the whole cd from God Is, God, You Are An Heir, Giants, Blessing from Abraham, Encourage Yourself, of course all of the older stuff.  One thing missing is Kelly Price should have guested on I Walk With God or bring back Stephanie Mills. 
I upgraded from the Canon Digital Rebel (grey body) to this because I was ready to take my photography to a new level. One thing I like most about this camera is it's flash compenstation. I purchased the 430ex flash with it because I was tired of having to use the built in flash and always getting those hard shadows on the wall
These are indeed the short, static hand wraps. You don't want static wraps, period. They're also too short
I hate Monopoly, but loved the idea of making my own game board. Sadly, MYOO had so many limitations! I gave it a higher ED rating because you can turn the game into an educational one, but it isn't intrisically educational. --- It doesn't print out spaces with color bars, just little green squares that you glue on the board below the pre-printed color bars. The background on everything you print is School Bathroom Green. You are stuck with Lotto squares on the board (bad for me since I believe gambling is evil). And you only have twelve Good/Bad News cards. I liked making my own money, though.  --- I figured out how to do most of the same stuff in Word. Here's how: --- I took the board from a "Your Town" clone of Monopoly and measured between the big squares. I think the individual squares are 2.5 by 3.5, but it doesn't matter, since your board may be different. In Word, I used a legal-sized paper (I think that's A5 for you Brits) and made a table that was nine columns that's how many are on my board) and two rows. Then I messed with it to get the proportions correct. You can fit three rows on one sheet of legal paper, if the return is really small, like 5 points. That gives you space to cut.  To get color bars, get your cursor in the top row. Type any letter.  --- Then highlight it, go up to "format" and click on borders and shading. Click on shading, click on a color, then make sure it says "cell" and not text or table. I use only 15 percent for most colors. Click on OK and you should have a color bar. Type in whatever text you want. Then click below to type in your property name. On printing, I found the last squares were outside the printing range, so I will only have eight squares next time and will print a separate sheet for "railroad" squares. --- The corner squares are about 2.5 inches on my board. I would recommend you make them bigger, then trim to size, so you won't have any dead space on your board. Cut and glue to a board you picked up at a thrift shop or yard sale and painted or covered. --- The property cards. These were actually easier than I thought. Make a table one column wide and two rows deep. Make it fill the whole page. Color as above, and type in whatever you want. When you print them out, print out 8 or 16 pages to a sheet to get cards. --- For chance and community chest ... well, what I came up with was using mail merge and a shipping label template. You  --- just print out on regular card or paper, and cut. The data file used for the merge would have your classy one-liners. I don't know about putting graphics in. Also, I can't figure out how to use merge. I did it once but can't figure it out now. --- Money I haven't been able to do. I have QuarkXpress and Adobe Pagemaker but don't know how to use either program. Plus, I wanted to make the money in Paint or something simple. Hope these directions help someone
Since I received this book I have been carting it around, using it for reference ever since. I wish that I had been introduced to this book sooner in my college career; it sets a good foundation for the basics. It is also good for sparking ideas if you are stuck. Robin Williams also writes well, making it a fun, easy read (like all her books). ---  --- I highly recommend this title
when given good stories tobe hooper can be a good director.to bad this one isn't a very good story. ---     this mess came out at the heigth of the "slasher" movie frenzy. but not wanting to be just a slasher movie they try to give us a monster also. the theme of 4 kids who,now hold on here,think it would be fun to spend the night in the funhouse at a traveling carnival. before you can say "please kill me" the "thing" is picking them off one by one. with only 4 teens in the funhouse you would think maybe some fleshing out of the teens would happen, but no, they just go for the tease scares and even at 90 mins. this bore last to long
Did not care for this one really, it is better as a body wash

I've seen it about 20 times now.  It doesn't get old.  The faces, the moves and the lines of Matthew Perry are always fresh.  My husband likes Selma, a lot, so it's a win win for both of us.  They are great together. --- Good stuff
This bar is larger that most nutrition or meal replacement bars - that much is true. What is also true is that is contains more fat.  ---  --- What you will notice with the first bite, is that the bar seems somehow "inflated". There is an emptiness to consistency of the bar. You are not getting the quality nutrition you would get from a Myoplex or Apex bar. Stick with those brands for pure nutrition and FAR BETTER TASTE.  ---  --- These METRX bars leave you feeling as though you've eaten something that was bad for you - like after you eat a dessert, yet these will not be mistaken for desserts
Though this book does present all the necessary information for learning about abnormal psychology, it's the dryest, most aesthetically difficult to read textbook... especially if you happen to be studying the material online/through independent study.  The publisher needs to redesign the book and/or you need to have a better online course professor. It feels nearly impossible to be interested in this material (which is interesting in itself) if you have to read the textbook front to back on your own without any instruction.
A MUST READ!!  THIS MAGAZINE GIVES YOU THE MOST UP TO DATE INFORMATION ON THE POWERLIFTING CIRCUIT. GIVES GREAT LIFTING AND FITNESS TIPS TO BOOT!!! THIS MAGAZINE SHOULD HAVE MAIN STREAM PUBLICATION AND DISTRIBUTION
I first read this book back in the mid-80s after watching the miniseries starring Gary Cole as Dr. Jeffrey MacDonald.  The miniseries absolutely riveted me, as did this book.  But upon repeated readings, I began to pick up inaccuracies and errors. I found that the book, rather than answering questions about this case, caused me to question more and more.  --- Joe McGinniss, while never a stellar writer to begin with, was eventually exposed as the worst kind of writer, twisting facts and quotes to serve his own purpose, which was to sell his theory and therefore, his book.  I have nothing against Mr. McGinniss forming his own opinion as to Dr. MacDonald's guilt or innocence, but to omit certain facts and blatantly lie about others and misquote principals and research in order to further your own propaganda is sickening.   --- If you want Joe McGinniss' theory on how and why the murders happened, with no regard to the cold hard facts and legal evidence, pick this book up.  If you want to read about the case, with all the facts in place both supporting and questioning Dr. MacDonald, do as other reviewers have suggested and read "Fatal Justice", a far more in-depth review of the case and evidence and form your own opinion. 
Being a flight attendant myself and looking through the SkyMall magazine countless times on long flights I can tell you...this book is AMAZING. I have never laughed so hard from a book all my life. I really want to get another one and put it in the crew lounge. I'm sure the flight crews will get a kick out of it :
What can I say about Lavazza that hasn't already been said.  I was in Rome two summer's ago and noticed it is in all the supermarkets. Decaf is usually not so great but this is. They must be doing something right
My [...] really likes this train puzzle. He knows his alphabet and is able to pick out which puzzle piece comes next in line and attach it. It goes straight across and is over 10 feet long. There is also a picture with each letter on the piece and this has helped him with words beginning with that letter. He will say "Q quail" or "N nut" when he is putting the piece on. The pieces are easy to attach, thick and very sturdy. The pieces comes apart with no worry of ripping the picture off. This would make a really nice gift for a 2-4 year old. The box is also very nice to keep the puzzle in.
I believe this is the best game in the genre.  It's gotten more play out of me than Master of Magic, Heroes of Might and Magic, Age of Wonders, Warlords, Disciples, Civilization, Alpha Centauri, Master of Orion, Space Empires, or Stars.  Once of the other posters says they have bad support, but that's not been my experience.  I've found their continued support and patches to be as good or better than any of the afore mentioned titles -- not bad for a 2 man team. ---  --- There is an amazing amount of variety in factions and would-be-gods you can play, and best of all it is for the most part solidly based upon Mythology -- far superior to the typically D&D derivative fantasy.  Multiplayer is fantastic. ---  --- It is a complex game however, and not to everyone's tastes. Definitely check out the demo first.  Beware though, it's addictive stuff! ---  --- Also check out the fan made maps on their website as well, some of which are quite pretty.  If you're stuck getting started, try the excellent Walkthrough by Bruce Geryk, also linked from their site
I was introduced to Nitin through my cousin who lives in England. She saw him live in London and raved about it...so off I went in search of this artist. He was difficult to find; nonetheless I was determined. I am one of those people who love music from almost all genres, cultures and corners of the globe. In other words, I am not a radio-pop saccharine sweet loving music listener. I look for music that proposes thought (although I do believe even top 40 has its place) If you are looking for an album/artist that resonates emotion, along with a powerful subtlety check Nitin Sawhney out. You won't be disappointed.
Words fail to capture my enthusiasm for LMI's Transparent Tambourine, which is as fine as anything I've banged against my thigh. ---  --- Unfortunately, my friends tell me I'm spreading myself too thin between my tambourine and triangle studies, but I'm not letting their negativity get inside my head, especially when I'm putting in three hours a night on these babies
Being a fan of the better CG and graphics of Sci-Fi such as Star Trek (the newer ones)  I was greatly surpised at how good the V series was.  V: The Final Battle is the second installment of the saga, so make sure to buy V: The Miniseries first.  The storyline is good, and characters are likeable and three-dimensional.  I highly recommend it for any Sci-Fi fan.  For old hands it is a fun movie, and for newcomers to both the series and the genre it is a good introduction
This magazine comes with lots of advertisements - 70% or more. Plus, articles (less than 15 articles in every issue) in the magazines are not very useful.  I subscribed the magazine because it is inexpensive and it is rated high by other subscribers.  Now I realize I made a mistake. 
I do not think suction cup mounts work very well.  This one is no exception.  While attaching and detaching my Garmin Nuvii is easy enough, the cup does not support the weight.  I was disappointed that a Friction bag was not available for my Nuvii.  However, I was able to Jury-rig an acceptable if less than pretty compromise.  I ordered the Friction mount, removed the screws on the bottom, detaching the mounts that would not fit my Nuvii, and stapled velcro strips purchased at Walmart across the base of the suction cup into the friction mount.  I have been cross country using this system and it works.  the Garmin Portable Friction Mount for GPS 010-10306-00 combined with the suction cup is a much better solution than the cup by itself
The Medela breast pump works with Dr. Brown's bottles (you can pump directly into the bottle)!  Just an added benefit to an already great product.  I've been using mine almost daily for 11 months and have had NO problems.  It's worth the money if you plan on breastfeeding/pumping for more than a couple of months
Ok,so it isn't one of the movie greats but it is really enjoyable.Four idiotos rob a bank when one of them is supposed to be marrying Drew's character,whatsername
aside from the nifty weather prediction, this clock is completely impractical.  The projection numbers are about 1/2 inch tall with minimal clarity.  The clock itself has a greenish background that only comes on if you press random buttons which makes knowing the time during the night almost impossible.  I am surprise this is sold on Amazon.  Thank goodness for Amazon's customer friendly returning policy.  I think Amazon should remove this clock and others like it for good.
I bought this just to try something new.  I love peach and mango flavors, and this sounded very good.  I do think it's a good drink, but whether or not I am able to think better because of it is up for debate.  I doubt I'll buy these again if only because they are quite pricey.  12 small cans (the liquid volume is only a smidgeon over one cup) for over twenty dollars?  It's close enough to $2 a can to make it not cost effective to get vitamins and minerals this way.  The taste is good, but I have had lots of other healthy drinks that taste just as good for less than a third of the cost.  But now I know, this drink is not for me.  If you like good-tasting nutritious drinks that cost a LOT of money, this one's for you! 
I have been using Microsoft Operating Systems for a very long time, and, i still say that this is the best System out there, for many reasons. ---  --- An increasing amount of Linux and Mac users have made the claim that they are more compatible with programs, and are less vulnerable to virus and hacks. ---  --- In Response to Linux Users- --- Stay away from Linux, Linux is free for a reason. It is compatible with very very few programs as it is, and that number will only decrease. For Gamers - Rarley do i see a Linux compatible game. Just stay away from this system. ---  --- For Mac Users- --- Mac's also have a lesser amount of compatible programs. Fewer and Fewer programs can run on them, and like linux, that number will only decrease. The only thing keeping Macintosh alive is Itunes. Which is compatible with Windows. Besides, When Direct X 10 Comes out, it will only be available for Windows, making Macintosh's un-usable for new games when the next windows OS comes out (Microsoft Vista). The computers are also generally more expensive than Windows.  Btw - You can get viruses on Mac's
I will not try to say that I asserted the painstaking, analytic effort that some would argue is necessary for an appreciation of Heidegger. More than that, I have no interest in doing so. It is largely agreed by the majority of his readers that this book deals with the question of being (existence), and my reading didn't lead me to any other conclusions. So as I said I have no interest in reading this a second time, further, deeper, or slower. ---  --- Being and Time is chock full of invented terminology, to the extent that Michael Inwood was able to profit from his publication of A Heidegger Dictionary. Whatever you might think the word "world" means, for instance, is not what Heidegger means, and he will explain that to you throughout the duration of an agonizing 40 pages or so. This is the case with his entire vocabulary. If there was any need for all of the inventions and distinctions made by Heidegger, I would not bring this up as a crticism. ---  --- Beyond the unventilated, severely sober, and utterly uninspiring character of Being in Time, I also call attention to the futility of it's project. If Heidegger was right about the historical neglect toward the question of being, perhaps more than 2000 years of historical peoples have been aware of something that eluded him: that there is no question of being.  ---  --- Why is "the question of being" so problematic? Because it is unanswerable, maybe. Or if it is answerable, we're not in any position to answer it. "Being" implies some kind of unvarying stability that just doesn't make sense. And if you posit an idea that is so concrete, so constant, you can't just bend it to make it fit reality. You've already betrayed your questioning. Truth, including the truth of being, is a local phenomenon. Truth is not always and forever true - it's true when it's true. But Heidegger wanted an everlasting truth, a dogmatic anthropology. ---  --- Worse than the general uselessness of his project, and the toxic dregs left in his wake, Heidegger is guilty of not even presenting his ideas in an intersting or thought-provoking way
Noah Webster's book is fascinating reading for today's students and teachers alike, as well as for the average citizen, as there is much to learn from it.  While it may be inappropriate to resurrect it as an  official school text, it certainly has a place in every school library.   One of the most notable features is the comprehensive phonetic system used,  with diacritical marks (accents) applied to all relevant vowels and  consonants; words are divided according to syllables and stress.  It also  spells the names of letters of the alphabet; something which tends to be  ignored in modern teaching.  The terminology of traditional grammar is  used, and there are copious word lists, with words grouped according to  common factors. I have no hesitation in recommending this book to all  students of the English language for the above reasons and for many other  interesting aspects (now-archaisms:thy/thou...; foreign words and phrases;  abbreviations explained; punctuation; etc).  This book should remain a  spelling classic
Should have believed all the other negative reviews.  Didn't work in my Honda Civic and didn't work in my Nissan Altima, both with original manufacturer tape decks.  In both cases, the tape deck whirred for a bit, then ejected the SmartDeck
When you watch commercial children's television, you have to accept the commercials because, after all, the programs are "free". But when you pay to subscribe to Nickelodeon magazine, I don't expect for it so be so full of alluring ads targeting children. These ads appear similar to the editorial content. It seems like 50% of the pages are advertisements! ---  --- I was disappointed and won't be renewing our subscription. Better to look at something from the Highlights magazine series.
This is a great idea, however if your crib has anything larger than a Jenny Lind style piece of wood on it, it won't work.  We don't have a sleigh style crib, but the top edges were still too large for the velcro to even touch.  It would be great if they would come up with a larger size to work for the more popular/larger style cribs everyone seems to be making/buying these days
I bought this for my 5 year old son for Christmas.  Not only did he think it was great but also his 7 and 9 year old sisters.  There are so many games that there was something for all of them. We took the toy with us to Grandma's and even the older cousins found it very fun and entertaining. ---  I really like that they can play all the games in Spanish too.  Once they have got the hang of a game in English they can do it in Spanish and it helps increase their vocabulary.  I was a little nervous if it would be worth the $50 because I had seen the barbie laptops and some others at radio shack. This one seemed like the best choice and was hoping this would be worth it.  In my opinion it is much better than the others we tried in the store and I would definately recommend it
Jewelry&watches ---  --- Live well... ---  --- You'll be always in a high spirit if you purchase this bracelet. --- It's a  really good gift for your friends
This cushion is very comfortable and retains its shape without being too firm.  It doesn't come with any straps or any way to secure it to the seat, so it does move around and fall forward when I get up.  Otherwise, I'm happy with it
I purchsed this product for my husband and he hates beauty products. When we got it the minty scent was soooo strong in the box. When we opened the box it was like a minty apple juice drink. He used it and I was all over him and the minty smell gave him just the right energy to "bring it"
I bought this for my kids because I knew they would love these songs just as I did.  Forget them!  I love it!  There is NOTHING like the Chipmunks and never will be again.  The Christmas song is worth the price alone.  Don't think about it.  Just get it
Hardley any bad ones in the whole bag. I bought these through "Figis" and theirs were terrible compared to these and had a lot of bad ones in them, plus they cost more
I dropped the camera from 2 feet and the metal outer rim of the lens slightly became bent and won't close. After some time spent tring to bend the metal back in place, I finally was able to close the lens.  ---  --- Besides that, it is an awesome camera. I am able to pick out a color (ex. red) and take a picture with that color standing out and everything else black and white. No photoshop needed
I had gotten my wife a new bike and needed to find a helmet for her above-average sized cranium. The Bell Triton was it. It fit perfectly the first time she put it on and adjusted it. I would recommend it for anyone with a good-sized head on their shoulders
Sephora Roll-up blotting paper is so handy. Whenever you have to freshen up, this is great to use before you powder your face. All you do is rip off the right about of paper you want and blot your face. They feel weightless and matte skin. Just imagine all the oil that gets trapped into a powder puff. gosh. disgusting! Best of all, you get so much paper, the roll is never-ending! It's so tiny and compact, you would even want to share them with your friends
I don't usually write reviews but had to voice my opinion on this toy.  I agree with the other review that the dolphins do not stay attached to the chariot and this frustrates my 4-year-old daughter!  Also our dolphins fall off and the one that is supposed to flip around gets stuck and does not flip half the time.  All that being said, she loves it
When I first got this item I was very pleased. It was so cheap and it looked great. It snaps so easily on and feels really cool. However, after about 3 weeks, the duller, not so shiny coat that I liked on the cover started to come off. Beneath it was a very shiny black coat. I was so disappointed, I took it off and went with my original cover. It looks really bad and just looks like something I've had for 3 years instead of just 3 weeks. I am very displeased with this item
Bought this case along with a Digital Rebel XTi, my first SLR. Instead of the 18-55mm kit lens I opted for the Sigma 17-70mm lens. Sad to say, but the case fits only with the kit lens.. The Rebel XTi with the 17-70mm lens barely fits. ---  --- So a word of cuation to everyone, if you're planning on anything other than the kit lens, then don't get this
This book is another excellant addition to the growing body of knowledge and accessible information on a health problem that plagues many Americans.  Adrenal fatigue and its consequences and causes should become one of the most crucial topics in health maintainance.  Another excellent book in this vein is Dr. J. Wilson's, Adrenal Fatigue, The 21st Century Stress Syndrome
Easy on the back and shoulders, as this is very light. It does a good enough surface job until the weekend vaccuuming. My 2 year old daughter loves to use it to help mommy! I bought this in a drug and discount store for $13.95. It's worth that
USE THE XL MOST EVERY DAY AND FIND THAT IT DOES A FAIRLY GOOD JOB FOR WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO DO. ONLY USE IT ABOUT TEN MINENTS AT A TIME SINCE I AM 72 I DONT OVERDUE IT. CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE IN MY ABDOMEN ALREADY
I really like this case!  It is easy to put on and take off.  It does not have that stupid plastic cover over the screen.  It does not add a lot of bulk to my phone and I think it makes my phone easier to hold.  I would like for more colors.  I would really like for something to glow in the dark, so that I could find it easier in the black hole that is my purse. 
My kids love Magnetix, but I am unable to order them online because you do not ship to Canada. This problem occurs a lot. Someone should fix that. I find it very frustrating when I try to order something and then it tells me they are "unable to fullfill my order because we can't ship outside the USA"
We were excited to find such a good deal. The clam shell cracked almost immediately and just got worse. The home charger never worked. The car charger works, so this keeps the one star rating and makes it worth the 4 bucks we paid for the package. One thing my boyfriend and I learned through this experience, is to pay for known quality and performance, in the long run you save money, hassle and time
chair is not at all what it's advertised as. does NOT massage just vibrates and makes you feel sick. compatible with sitting on a washing machine. 
I recently purchased the Zooper Tango Sidy by Side Double Stroller.  I had done some looking at stores & extensive research online.  Suddenly, I found this on Amazon of all places.  The reviews were great & the price was right.  I bought it, a little hesitant that I hadn't gotten to test drive it.   ---  --- This stroller is great!  It fits through doorways, it's a little tight in an aisle, but we're talking about a double stroller here, it's going to be a little wide!  I have a 2 year old & 1 year old, so I do find that it veers to the side that my 2 year old sits on, just slightly.  It is heavier than the Peg Perego Aria is, but it feels much more solid.  Folds easily & somewhat compactly (again, it's a double stroller!).  It fits into the back of my Honda Odyssey with room for bags & whatnot. ---  --- I would recommend this stroller to anyone with twins or 2 little ones.  My 2 year old likes to "nap" (recline the seat) while we are walking.  The back zips off, she likes to look out the back.  A 5 point harness keeps everyone safe, but I find that I usually just use it as a waist seat belt.   ---  --- Storage is limited, my husband wants to customize the basket area - it sounded like his plans involved a hack saw...There is a spot for a bottle of water or misc items (a hanging net type basket - just big enough for a bottle of water) & a zip pocket on the back of the stroller.  However, if you unzip the back & remove it, you have lost this pocket.  I did read that McClaren has a stroller organizer for about [...] - we were planning on buying this to carry more stuff. ---  --- Overall, I do love our new stroller & would highly recommend it!
I am writing this review primarily to let people know what to expect from this product, since Amazon/Toys R Us don't seem to have a clue - even the image was provided by a thoughtful customer. I bought this in-store at Toys R Us because sizing information was not available online (except for the size of the box, for some bizarre reason) and I didn't want to take a chance with getting the wrong size. So let me share that information with you - this helmet is suitable for head sizes from 20.5" to 22". I think overall that this is a great set, but I marked it down a point because it does not include elbow protection. From my own experience learning to skate or even snowboard, I can say that I would generally fall onto my knees or the heels of my hands, so knee pads and wrist guards would be perfect for me. But with a young child who knows?! This is for my neice (I am not a parent) and whilst I am generally happy with the set as it is, I think it would be nice to include the elbow protection (which is afterall available in other sets, but does not appear to be available separately) to make a complete safety package. Perhaps we are supposed to buy and extra set so we have the elbow pads and two sets of knee pads, or perhaps I am a touch too cynical
This is one of the most fun games I've every played.  There are tons of belly laughs as people try to bluff their way through an answer to a question.  I find the questions (and answers) are quite educational too, I've learned a lot from these questions.  A group of family members played at Christmas (6 of us) and it was hilarious to watch some people try to come up with an answer to the question (a bluff).   We even let our 5 year old nephew "play" and he was pretty good with coming up with some bluffs.  Try it, it is loads of fun.  I recommend a group of at least 4 though
I just got my tamagotchi last week and my cousin couldnt stop holding it. He fed and played with it everytime.It got sick every minute because my cousin kept feeding him.One day my cousin had wet hands and touched my tamagotchi toy.It died for a week I had to get it fixed.I wish you made the tamagotchi V4 waterproof.
I have been using this mascara for years.  I have tried other brands--drugstore varieties as well as department store varieties and have been disappointed with everything else I have ever tried.  Why?  This mascara is smooth; it does not flake off and fall into your eyes.  It does not ever look clumpy.  It is also easy to remove without losing any eyelashes.  I would not say that this mascara will make your lashes "a mile long" or "dangerously thick" or whatever hype you hear from other brands.  Those kinds only ever look like clumpy mascara.  Just a simple nice, natural looking mascara that won't irritate your eyes
A number of people had told me that this was a very good war movie and one that should be viewed as soon as possible.  Honestly, I was not impressed.  The plot is disjointed and confusing; jumping from the North African Theatre to the European Theatre almost seamlessly, leaving the viewer thoroughly confused.  The character development is also very poor.  No one character stands out due to the fact that Samuel Fuller never allows them to grow or mature by switches between multiple characters too frequently or by not allowing any lengthy dialogue.  Historically speaking this film is a joke.  During the action scenes when the Germans have tanks they are in fact American tanks with the German symbol painted on.  Also, uniforms are sometimes inaccurate.  However, the most annoying aspect is the fact that Samuel Fuller makes it appear as though this squad of men is the ONLY squad fighting the entire war.  Only once or twice do you see any other American troops.  This feeling of isolation detracts from the overall sense of a full scale war, of which these men are supposed to be a part of.  Finally, to make matters worse, the film's action sequences are sometimes imaginative but are often impractical, sloppy, awkwardly placed, and consist of ridiculous situations.   ---  --- Overall this movie was too long, lacked character development for most of the movies characters, was disjointed, and was historically inaccurate.  For a movie that garnered so much hype I was expecting much, much more. ---  
DELICIOUS, CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REGULAR PASTA AND THIS PRODUCT, EXCEPT I AM LOSING WEIGHT, SO IT MUST NOT BE AFFECTING MY BLOOD SUGAR
Same old GW bunch of ridiculous opinions. I thought this one might be better, but no... ---  --- Now even pine isn't good enough - it has to be 100 year old pine
You know how when a regular pick hits your strings, you can hear the sound of it hitting the string, then after it releases and the string reverberates you hear a note?  Well imagine hearing 15 picks hit the string before the string produces music.  And the 15 picks are made of coiled wire.   ---  --- I can't imagine a worse sound or feeling.   --- 
would someone be able to give me the dimensions/measurements for this mattress?  Thanks so much!  I DO NOT HAVE THIS-HOWEVER IT MADE ME PUT IN A RATING IN ORDER TO POST A QUESTION...
This movie was always a fun one to watch; however, after Katrina in New Orleans, it was the best comic relief on those days when it was all going wrong as we rebuilt the house. Love the movie
Besides all the functions described above, the cable has one more function:it can be used as a charger ,too!This is really cool.The company's  service is great. For every order I put, I received the products within 3-4 days at the price of ground shipping fees
Speedy shipment on this product...have not tried it yet but the quality, packaging and so forth seem very good
I keep an indoor garden and I need accurate readings. It is of poor quality and unreliable. Don't buy this
I was unsure of whether to purchase this product when I saw that my printer (HP Deskjet 712C) was not on the list put out by the manufacturer but after reading some others' reviews, I tried it anyway because the price was right.  It may look a little cheesy but it works.  I didn't even need the CD that comes with it in order to use the product.  I just plugged it in to my printer and then into my new Dell laptop and it worked.  I think I may have had to restart and add my printer but that was it.  Very good product
The case and ear bud are fine, but the car charger I was sent doesn't even fit my Nokia 6230. That was the main reason I bought this package.
This is a good alternative to the bombard of Hollywood films. It potrays beutifully and naturally the meaning of love and the loneliness of the elderly. I live in one of the Asian countries where the famili members still have strong emotional bound to one another. Watching this film, I came to realize how lonely one's life can be when one grows old in the so called modern countries. Because things are so modernized, things have got so mechanical, human relation is no exception. This happens to the mother in this film. It is so touchy to see when the mother and the father come to visit her son's family, everybody is so busy with his/her business, everybody is in a rush and in the end the two of them have to stay in a quiet house with nobody around. Their visit is not strong enough to hold people from minding his/her business. --- Her being attracted to the young carpenter is a sign that she actually needs attention and that she is lonely rather than the raw 'love' between a man and a woman. --- I recommend this film to those who love to watch a film about love, family and relationship.
This is not as described..it is very hard to move - heavy and bulky. If you have a place to set it up and leave it, fine, but this is not going to be pulled out every day for a 'stroll in front of the TV', as described.  Performance-wise it seems very nice and is a good solid piece of equipment, but definitely not an item that can be put away after each use.  I'm disappointed
I was nervous about installing kit, but it was easy. Took me maximum 10 minutes and works well
The Back to Nature Graham Sticks, Honey are delicious! They are a great tasty snack. There's no way you can eat 'em without a cup of milk. Not because they're rich, but they're a little on the dry side. I still like them so much that I quit buying them at the supermarket & started buying them in bulk [...
Just got to use the Weber Baby Q griddle. It worked great. The only complaint I have is that it could be bigger. It covers just a little over half of the available grill area. More would be better. ---  --- Other than that, the design is excellent and it works great
I have a Sony Ericsson Z520a and bought this as a replacement for the name brand charger I got with the phone.  While it does charge, I am unable to get the battery charged to more than 98%.  I am unsure, however, if this is because my battery is less effective than when new.  But, all said, it serves its purpose
I recently purchased the tent cot and decided that it would be best to have the rain fly to go along with it. The rainfly fits snuggly with elastic corners. Also, there are straps that attach to the ends of the cot with clips. The sides tie down in four places to prevent it from flying around when you don't have it fully zipped up. My only gripe and the reason it doesn't get five stars is that I think it should have just come with the tent cot in the first place rather than having to order it separately
I used to devour the De-Lite Dark Chocolate bars but Walmart stopped carrying them.  Damn!  Well, these are just as tasty!  I agree with these other people...this makes the grade.  For those of you who want to stay away from sugar for one reason or another, these bars "hit the spot" when the chocolate craving strikes
This episode is a bit different than the others I have seen, although I have not yet seen all of season 2 yet.  Without giving anything away, this episode shows growth in 3 of characters as human beings.  Additionally, it has some inventive guest characters.  Finally, it presents some moral and ethical questions
GREG and TIM know what they are talking about and glad to add this book to my collection!  WALT DISNEY RECORDS deserved a treatment like this and it would make a GREAT gift for the holidays! A+++++++++++++++++
I've tried this twice now, and both times it had an off taste.  A bit rancid, like it had been stored for too long at too high a temperature. ---  --- I'd guess that Amazon's transport or storage has a problem they need to work out
This item was fairly easy to assemble.  Would be easier with 2 people but I put it together in less than 30 minutes.  It was easy to mount onto the roof rack as well.  Bought this for a long car trip but wanted to take a trial run with it of about 500 miles round trip. On the trip we ran into some rain and a couple of quick downpours.  The carrier held up well.  I had a couple of drops of water on the inside and that was my fault.  It was obvious that it was from the unused holes in the bottom for attaching it to the roof rack and I forgot to use the covers for those holes.  Overall it help up great and expect it will do well for our trip to Florida
Beautiful gameplay and cinema graphics bring new life to the Valkyrie Epic.  The storyline is every bit as compelling as the original with some new twists.  Valkyrie Profile 2 is one of the last best games that will ever hit the PS2 making it a must buy.  On a personal note, this game made me want to play the original again before starting it so I highly recommend playing VP1 through before starting VP2
I have always bought and liked Uniden phones.  Tried this one based on Consumer Reports recommendation and because I wanted caller ID.  AWFUL reception - too much background noise and you cannot hear the person on the other line.  Turn the volume to high and you get feedback from your own voice.  Good range (which is useful in finding the perfectly quite place in your house to finish your call!).  Stay clear!!!!!!
This is an excelllent watch, and it does what it promises to be
This camera was easy to use and it was light and had decent quality picture and audio, however, I was unable to make copies for back-up or to share with family members. I took it back and bought a mini-DV camcorder as I was told it was easier to make copies. This has yet to be tested
I purchased the cable for my Nokia 6255i. The cable came faster than expected (I find Amazon fulfillment of orders VERY slow). The cable came with the software driver (although I did not need it) and worked great with my already installed Nokia Sync software. Electro Island had the best price by far and the service was excellent. I would definitely use them again
DO NOT BUY THIS!!! It does not work "As Seen on T.V." We were able to get it to cut a cucumber and that was it. Would not cut a tomato, onion, carrot, apple only a cucumber. Complete waste of money
I must say that I have been really impressed with this product. I tend to have skin that is combo/oily, which results in occasional pimples here and there. Not really acne, but annoying blackheads and bumps. I had been using something else similar to this with ok results. However, within just 2 days of beginning this, I noticed immediate results. My breakouts have been a non-event, and even if I get a pimple here or there, it's gone in a day. I've even noticed a drastic improvement in those hard-to-eliminate blackheads. My skin feels much smoother and my pores look better. I don't see how I could ever be without this
I started with Caesar2 back when it came out. I played it for hours and hours and loved it. When Caesar3 came out I bought that too and loved it even more and spent even more time playing. Both Caesar2 and 3 rarely crashed. Things have changed! ---  --- I'm spending more and more of my time restarting Caesar4 than I am playing it. About 8 out of 10 times that I access the area where you trade with other cities it crashes. Without trading, you make little money and the game is essentially over. ---  --- Other problems I'm seeing is overall performance. I don't have the fastest machine (AMD 2.1ghz, 512ram, rockin' video card with 256meg of mem) but there are irritating 1 second delays in addition to the crashes. I find the whole game to be difficult to use. This was not the case with Caesar3. ---  --- Unless they issue a patch, I'm done feel frustrated with crashes. Maybe I can dumb down the graphic setting to get rid of the delays. ---  --- My suggestion? Wait for a patch before buying --- or move on. --- - jason --- 
Apparently the difference between a criminal act (theft) and moral redistribution of income is 1) who you steal from (stealing from the wealthy, of course, is moral -- according to Rawls and Bolsheviks), and 2) who receives the loot (the non-wealthy makes it moral), and 3) who commits the act (the state/society, of course also makes theft moral; example - taxation), and 4) your intentions (redistribution of income). To look at this another way, if your neighbor breaks into your house and steals your money, that's a crime (unless your neighbor is poor -- which would then be moral and Justice, according to Rawls' formula). If the community comes into your house and steals from you, it's legal and moral Justice, again, according to Rawls. Because, according to Rawls, if, before you were born, you were to vote with everyone on how physical world society should be structured, you'd vote to have the state guarantee that everyone was equal, or they would be compensated somehow for being born (unjustly) less-equal. How? By compensating those with less by stealing from those with more. So those with more would be like oh, say ... a milk-cow who gets milked to serve those with less. So those with more would become a resource, or state-owned slaves to those with less ... because "society" (the Robin Hoods and Rawls of the world) deemed this as moral Justice. Rawls does not take into account those who are willing to take on risk, entrepreneurs, students of life who work to earn an "A" vs. students who earn an "F". He points out that many people are born into difficult situations through no fault of their own. True. But that does not implicate those within society who are born into better situations as the cause, nor are those who are born into better situations responsible for making up the difference. Forcing the "wealthier" ones to be accountable for the unfairness within life and pay the bill isn't Justice or moral. It would simply be an unjust law. Some people see Rawls' theory as a blueprint for a future generation utopia (like the Bolsheviks envisioned Marxism). I see it as an insane blueprint for slavery, and a powerful dis-incentive for earning personal reward and merit. In a sense, this book is an argument against the individual. It sees the world through a blurred lense where the author only recognizes masses of people -- he doesn't recognize any individuals (unless they were born as victims). Curious. How do you experience life ... as a group-mind (an oxymoron if there ever was one), a collective? Or as a unique, isolated, independent, individual? There should be societal incentives to help each other. Okay. But when it is forced (theft of property always implies force), it is no longer an issue of morality or justice -- it's simply a law. Without personal choice being involved there is no morality as an issue, by definition. Transforming advantaged individuals into mules forced to carry the burdens of the world is a definition of justice for whom? ---  --- 
Like someone else said, I don't have a problem paying for a high quality beauty item that works as it says it does.  Cinnamon buns has a great lather, smells wonderful when you use it, and makes your skin soft.   ---  --- I have used it as a shampoo and the scent lingers a bit longer using it on your hair, but it really doesn't function as well as a shampoo as it does as a shower gel.  For a bubble bath ya have to use so much of it I just can't do it. I find myself counting  the ounces I'm pouring under the faucet and have decided to use it as a treat only. ---  --- The smell doesn't last very long, but have found that it does linger longer if you lather, rinse and repeat, like it says on the bottle.   ---  --- It's a dollar an ounce.....not sure if I'll try any of the other 'flavors' simply because of the cost
I was very pleased with this charger. I was considering a portable charger but was advised that it may not work if the battery is too low. My van would not start after some cold weather and my battery was so low that the interior lights were out. After reading info about other chargers I decided on this one.  I read the directions connected it and it did the job. I called Black and Decker and they were very helpful with any questions I had. This is a small price to pay for the convenience, certainly better then having to call a tow truck. It's portable and lightweight, stores easy.I never charged a battery in my life and I was able to do it
This bag is great for your SLR digtial camera. It has space for your extra lens. Everything that came with you SLR camera fits in this bag. this bag is a great buy and its not that expensive
I ordered this shade hoping that it would cover all of my baby when we're out strolling in the sun.  It does a pretty good job; only my son's feet and ankles are exposed when he is reclined (my only beef about the product), but I can cover his little piggies and ankles with sunscreen or shoes with no problem.  I like the fact that the shade protects from UV rays and is easily adjustable.  I leave it on my stroller all the time and can still fold up the stroller with it attached.  I think the side pouches are an excellent plus.  I am very pleased with this product and will recommend it to my friends and family
I bought a case of these from Amazon because someone on some candy forum claimed these were of "excellent" quality and that they were comparable to premium brands like Haribro. ---  --- Don't believe it. These are cheapo gummi bears, no better than whatever cheapo junk your local drugstore/supermarket/bigbox sells. Pretty squishy (not very chewy), and a variety of bland flavors that all taste mostly like sweet.  ---  --- There's no point in buying these
I've had this PC remove for 1 year and I have used it everyday that I am home and I have not yet changed the remote batteries.  My PC has suddenly become more entertaining and useful.  With this remote, the time I spend sitting in front of the monitor is reduced. ---  --- In my 860 sq ft APT, the farthest point away from my pc is about 50 ft.  The remote has always worked from anywhere in the APT thru 2 walls. I was surprised to get this much range. I have not yet found a spot from which it doesn't work.  To get the best range BE SURE to position the USB RF receiver near the computer as directed. ---  --- With my PC, I'm always playing music.  I also play digital video files that were either taken with my camera or were rented digitally from the Internet.  I have a good graphics card with S-Video TV out.  I got a 50 ft S-Video/Out cable; this connects my PC and TV which are in different rooms.   ---  --- With this remote, I now can play (and control) my entire digital music collection on my home stereo (which is connected to the TV) without being at my PC or be in the same room as my PC.  Also, with this remote, any video that can be played on my PC, (online streaming or local) I can watch and control it (pause, rewind, slow motion, next, FWD) on my TV.   ---  --- My PC/TV has effectively become a powerful media center--Media center PC not needed.    ---  --- There is so much more...  with the remote, I use the mouse from far away (lying in bed or on the couch); there a numerous ways to get creative with this. ---  --- I wish the remote was lighted. Still, the keys are arranged for "touch typing" so to speak.  Another negative, I've noticed that Windows Media Player sometimes crashes when video is launched from within the software that comes with the remote.
This is the 3rd or 4th time I have bought this type of batteries and I am always satisfied with their performance.  They are a great value
I can't discard these songs completely, because they have such potential! Clever, fun lyrics, great beat, but BOY I wish this guy could hit his notes more often! ---  --- I suppose this fellow requires the sort of "pitch doesn't matter" mindset that Grateful Dead listeners perfected years ago (or similar drugs). I'm just not that tolerant or substance affected
Have always used the regular California Duster.  Time to replace the one I have had for years.  Thought I would try the Extra Large duster.  This has twice the dusting surface, it is faster and does the same great job.  I have a black Town and Country which shows dust!  This does a great job in just a few minutes.  A great product
This step sucks.  If you are used to doing step classes at the gym, you will find it difficult to switch to this smaller step.  I didn't know it was a smaller step or I wouldn't have bought it.  It is hard to adjust to the shorter step, especially when doing a turn step or V step.  It ends up being VERY close to a basic step.  I was so nervous about stepping too close to the end and flipping the whole step up, that I was cheating myself out of a full workout.  DO NOT buy this, if you're used to the step at the club.  I feel like it's more dangerous on this, and ended up doing a lot of the steps on the floor.  If you already know that you like to step, buck up and buy the club size step, even though it is twice the price of this one.  Otherwise, don't buy anything
This was a great movie for me because my daughter did this dance routine in a school production 15 years ago and we both wanted to see the movie over and over again
This is a great starter deck for any duelist.  With just a few booster packs this deck will become unstopable!  After only a few days of practice with this deck I had beaten all of my friends who had been dueling for months.
bike has very nice detailing, paint has a nice shine, really like the fenders to help keep daughter clean, great buy!
I helped my five-year old assemble this, and, like most LEGO directions, it went together well...unfortunately, it doesn't stay together...when he tries to play with it, the tail section falls off or it breaks in the middle...not as easy to put back together once it's come apart...it's proven a real disappointment..
While the two fans I ordered for a new computer build are functioning properly, they are not as advertised on Amazon's website.  According to the specs on the site, they have a double ball-bearing design which last longer than normal fans. Be warned, these are NOT the Antec double ball-bearing fans, but the less expensive ones.  Have contacted Amazon and hope they update the specs to reflect these accurately
Awhile ago I was having a conversation with someone about musical tastes where we vastly disagreed on what was simply awesome bands and which ones were purely based around taste, such as people who love R&B and Rap to people who prefer Dance. In a way, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, as well as the Exorcist and the Shining are like the Beatles and Led Zeppelin of horror movies: you must love them and say anything different and you're going to get lynched. So I will agree that the film is definately refreshing considering the latest crop of so-called "horror movies", yet at the same time I wonder why it didn't hit me that much. ---  --- 5 kids are travelling through the country and hear of a couple of houses. They decide to check it out only no one's home...seemingly at first. Pretty soon they meet Leatherface, a man in a burlap sac mask who wields a big fat chainsaw. Pretty soon, the kids start going one by one and we find a family seriously depraved and having to escape alive. It's odd how I can't say any more about the plot; not because of spoilers but because there's not a lot else to say. ---  --- Like many a filmgoer, I can't stand the latest releases in horror. Instead of using atmosphere, pacing and mood to creep people out, they go for broke and show some of the more violent scenes. This film isn't even gory at all. In fact, the film's goriest scene, where one of the kids meets a chainsaw, isn't even shown onscreen. Your mind fills in what went on which can probably be even more disturbing. Adding to the realism is that it's shot in a kind of documentary-like style. One problem I had with the film was that the dread didn't feel there. There was pre-MTV style editing and extreme-closeups of eyeballs and maybe I've just seen it before but it didn't creep me out like it should've(and having a woman scream for 20 minutes doesn't help). ---  --- If I saw this in 1974, I mostly likely would've been creeped out of my wits but seeing it 32 years later, it's more like "yeah it was alright although I better not say so cause then everybody will bug me about it". If you're a fan, go ahead and buy it because it's probably the best release of the film but personally, I'm not
Erickson, a notorious communist and bogus half baked historian is not to be trusted with his works, all based on bogus, doctored and unrelaible Soviet semi fictions intended to advance the cause of Bolshevik invincability.
I will keep this review short. The product DOES NOT work. Period. I have been using the product morning and evening since the begining of February and have not seen a single change. I just bought some Olay eye cream a week ago and can already see an improvement
It arrived fast enough, but I should have sent the chair back. It's pretty cheaply made, the ends are taped with what looks like regular scotch tape. It's OK, but I'll keep my eyes open for a better one. And we won't swing on it. I don't think it would take it.
hair dryer worked good for about 1 year. Then the switch broke, fused in the open position.I would not buy an Andis product again
The quality of this CD recording sounds like someone tapped it in their garage and burned it to CD with thier personal PC. Very bad recording. It's too bad because Lathleen Madigan is very witty and funny.
Nice little video for my Zen during my long wait at the doctor's office.  Confucius overcame many difficulties
Ordered large, got "youth large", too small. Threw out receipt before checking. My bad. wife now wears T-shirt to work out in
I've never purchased a worse item - ever.  I bought three of them for the kids... and they are all scratched, damaged, and of inferior quality.  Buy this only if you hate someone
Having struggled with digital scales that broke after a few years, I finally decided to get the scale my doctor has.  It's terrific because I can see it clearly (the numbers are right in my face) and it is built to last forever! My daughter and I assembled it with a minimum of effort. The directions are written clearly and all adjustments are super easy to handle. It is clearly the best scale I've ever owned.  The down side is that it needs a bit more space than a regular floor scale.  You can, however, buy a piece of plywood and put the scale on top of the wood in a carpeted room if your bathroom can't handle the bigger size
I bought this camera in Oct 2005. I brought it everywhere. Loved it. In April 2006, the LCD screen blew. Canon replaced it with a refurbished camera. In March 2007, the exact same thing happened to the screen and now they will only repair for $97.00, as they have determined this is the result of impact damage. How they determine this is unclear to me, as it was not dropped or impacted...Apparently, you will spend 100.00/yr maintaining this camera. That, to me, is the hallmark of a faulty product. Unfortunate - as I really loved this camera
-Not a great one here, entertaining for all the wrong reasons, mainly because the film is so bad, so often. ---  --- -It is nice to see Christina Ricci in a movie again, as she's usually good even in a bad movie and doesn't do too bad here. ---  --- -Wes Craven directs this one and I could tell right away it must have been do to a contract obligation (much like Edward Norton in "The Italian Job"). I could tell this because very little effort seemed to be put into the script, both the story and lines of dialogue were very predictable and dumb. Also very little effort seemed to be put into the effects, as they were very lousy at times, especially when they finally showed the werewolf. ---  --- -As I said before, quite predictable the story was, both Ricci and her brother get bitten by a werewolf after they try to save a girl who got into a car wreck. Then both try to figure out what's wrong with them, though the brother is much more active about it than Ricci.  ---  --- -It's also quite obvious who the main werewolf was, the film tries a bit of a swerve, but it doesn't really work.  ---  --- -Besides Ricci, the cast includes Shannon Elizabeth (American Pie 1&2), Portia De Rossi (Arrested Development), Joshua Jackson (Pacey on "Dawson's Creek"), Scott Baio (don't ask me why) among others. All do pretty poor jobs, besides Ricci that is, the rest don't really seem to care, not that I blame them that is. ---  --- -There is some humor throughout the film, but a lot of the film will get unintentional laughs from those who watch it. ---  --- -The only reason to watch this is to make fun of it as the effort is not really there by mostly anybody on the cast or crew. 
I first picked up a copy of Nylon in Chicago, while browsing the newsstands. I wasn't sure if I would like it--years of subscribing to Vogue, Elle, and some stupid tweeny magazines had almost put me off magazine-reading for good. And yet I always manage to be drawn to the racks. ---  --- Nylon was different from the get go. They always feature unknowns on the cover, and when, on occassion, a well-known celebrity is featured, the stories give us a new perspective on them.  ---  --- Nylon is worth purchasing for the layout in itself. I could spend hours paging through each feature, marveling at the graphics, and the way the magazine is put together. I love how they base some of the beauty section on famous movies or bands. ---  --- Nylon also makes a point of covering bands, movies, and fashion designers that, until now, have remained obscure. Everything they feature is amazing--most of the music they recommend ends up on my Amazon wishlist! ---  --- I would highly recommend Nylon to anyone and everyone. This obscure magazine will stun you with its amazing artistic layout, and introduce you to new products you may have never discovered
I bought the Shampoo Theory and Condition Theory and this Redo Freshen-Up Mist. I have normal-type hair that needs to be washed every other day -- and if I use a lot of product, it needs to be washed every day. I have very sensitive skin too. This mist worked very well on my hair, definitely freshened it up and allowed me to restyle it with a quick blow dry. And it feels awesome on my skin. Well done, Jonathan
my daughter is not even 2 yrs old and she is already having a hard time fitting into the potty -- i think this is the case for other types of potty seats too so i'll be trying the type u attach to the adult seat and see how it goes
A mix of the softest chessyest mushy reggae from the 80s. Don't even bother...
My father-in-law received this as a gift.  He reports that it is too salty and he's not eating it
Below is my experience with this product after owning it for 2 weeks. ---  --- Pros: --- ----- --- 1. Amazing sound especially when watching DVD movies --- 2. Very good progessive scan DVD picture quality --- 3. Simple, compact and all-in-one design --- 4. Remote control can work with various TV's, Cable boxes and VCR's --- 5. Can play both NTSC and PAL DVD's ---  --- Cons: --- ----- --- 1. Expensive --- 2. No HDMI output --- 3. Non-intuative remote control --- 4. No headphone jack ---  ---  --- Overall, I love and chose the Bose 321 because of the sound quality and compact design. I got this system because I wanted a compact all-in-one media center and I was not interested in getting a HTIB with 5 speakers. I looked at Denon (2 products), Sony and Samsung. ---  --- I use this on my 23" Samsung LCD TV using Monster component video cables and while I would have preferred to take advatange of its HDMI capabilties, the reality is that I am very happy with this image quality. Movies such as Lord of the Rings, The Matrix and Hero look and sound fantastic. Prior to this I was looking at the Sony DAV-X1 which is much cheaper and more feature-rich. However the internal turmoils between their consumer electronics and media divisons convince me this would not work for me. For example, my PAL DVDs cannot be played on the Sony whereas on the Bose it was no problem. I am of the opinion that Sony is a directionless company and this is reflected in their products. ---  --- To be fair you do need to have the right kind of room to take advantage of their TrueSpace 2.1 surround sound feature. My couch is up against the wall with the media center located 12 ft in front of me. According to Bose the speakers should ideally be 3 feet away from the TV. Sometimes TrueSpace works and sometimes I can't hear it. I believe this is true among all the other competitors in this market line and that neither one stands out ahead of the other. If surround sound is really that important to you, then you should get a 5.1 system. This product is perfect for a small room as it takes advantage of the echos of the room where it can fake a 3D sound and would probably not be ideal for a family size rec-room. ---  --- The audio quality from music CD's is very good and while I wish this had an iPod port as found on the Denon, I am very content using the Aux port
Earrings are pretty, but look cheap and very flimsy.  I know they are supposed to be delicate, but they are not what they appear to be from the picture
This is a film like none other you have ever seen, and as such you'll either love it, or hate it. ---  --- From the "reviews" posted on Amazon, I've come to the conclusion that the people who hate it are simply people who don't have the intelligence to have understood a word of it. ---  --- This film is not literal.  Learn to *think* about what you are watching.  To interpret archetypes, symbolism and metaphor. ---  --- A clue: the Lady character is named STORY.  Now why might that be? ---  --- And why would she require a VESSEL before taking flight into the world? ---  --- And what precisely does the wolf-like Scrunt represent? ---  --- And why are there THREE of those monkeys? ---  --- This film is a love letter from one creative person to all other creatives in the world.  If you aren't an artist, you probably won't get it at all, and might even post a scathing review of it on sites such as this.   ---  --- But that achieves nothing but illustrate how stupid you truly are to the artistic souls that will understand everything this film says, and love every beautiful, unique and visionary second of it. ---  --- Magical.
These might appease your sweet tooth while providing excellent nutrition in a 200 calorie natural food bar. They are not overly chocolately like those chocolate covered protein bars: the bar has delicious chocolate throughout with a terrific crunch of sesame, flax, and sunflower seeds. I'm hypoglycemic and they are perfect to keep in the car for the quick pick up to prevent the need for glucose and a true crisis. I highly recommend. Oh, I have ordered both from Nutiva and from Amazon: Amazon is less expensive and faster delivery
THIS HAMMOCK IS MADE OF SOFT COTTON STRING. IT IS EXTRA LARGE AND VERY STRONG. YOU NEED 13 FOOT SPAN TO HANG IT TAUNT, WHICH GIVES YOU ENOUGH ROOM FOR THE WHOLE FAMIL
My husband is in love with this razor!  He thought he was a Norelco-only fan, until I bought him this model for Christmas.  I purchased it due to the great reviews it received, both from consumers and independent reviewers, and also b/c it cost less than $40.  It leaves his face so smooth, whether he shaves daily or skips a couple of days.  In fact, he can finally shave the hairs on his upper neck without getting razor burn.  Highly recommended
Fantastic product--I am a group fitness instructor and I use this product everyday--I add a banana, peanut or cashew butter, plain yogurt, ice and water--this is in lieu of dinner--I don't get hungry and it really keeps my energy levels up
Good quality, well built vest of full bodied fleece.  Vest is slightly fitted at the waist for a feminine look and the arm holes are neatly close fitting to keep the warmth in.  Sizes run alittle large.  I love my extra small vest and my daughter loves her small vest
this is a wonderfull massager, i have had other ones in the past and they were'nt as good as this one. for $50 this massager is great it really was well worth the money for what it gives out to yourself. the power on it was amazing i was really shocked i dident think it would be that much in a good way though. so i was very pleased with buying this acuvibe massager and it really does work great so i hope i helped you make your chose right
If you look at my review history, you may note that I've given very few five-star reviews. I save five stars for outstanding products. I believe Wordperfect X3 is best described as outstanding. ---  --- A long time ago, I used Word Perfect. However, my earlier jobs required I use MS Word, so I did my best to become a Word guru. I believe I accomplished that short of creating custom macros. As a law clerk, I started a new job where WordPerfect was the standard. ---  --- So, last year I bought WordPerfect 12. At first it was difficult, but I bought a book that helped me fill in the blanks. With the ability to customize keyboards and the fact that WordPerfect gives the author a great degree of control (especially with show-codes), I was soon able to become a WordPerfect guru. I remembered all the things I used to love about WordPerfect. Like any lover, I also learned to ignore some of the blimishes of WordPerfect. (One of those blemishes is the behavior of pushing a change from that point of the document forward, which, once you get accustomed to it, is really a nice feature.) Wordperfect and PDFs are the two accepted file formats for electronic submission to Federal courts. ---  --- There were two complaints I found at work among Word devotees: 1) the ability to export to PDF but not import and 2) the inability to cut from a Word document into a WordPerfect document without creating all the formatting litter Word likes to use. ---  --- 1. We occasionally receive PDFs that we would have to retype to be able to make edits. With the ability to import PDFs (that is, those that were authored and exported into PDF, not documents scanned into PDF), we were now able to edit those PDFs. This was a real time saver. Since PDF is the de facto universal standard amongst all platforms (Windows, Mac, Unix), this was a great improvement. ---  --- 2. Formatting litter is a real pain to deal with. I never could get a MS Word document to just import into WordPerfect without headaches in trying to fix the formatting. My solution was to copy the portion out of MS Word, paste into a text file, copy again and then paste into WordPerfect. My complaint was I could not just straight paste into WordPerfect. Well, Corel heard my cry and provided the ability to copy just the text. The lone MS Word holdout in my office capitulated with that. He has no more to complain about. ---  --- Another great thing about WordPerfect is the fact that the file format for its documents has not changed in years (I heard a WP rep say no change since 1995). Why should it? Everything you could want to do in a document (perhaps barring professional typesetting) can be done in WordPerfect. There's no need to create a new format when the one you have just works. ---  --- This product does exactly what those who have come to love WP expect it to do. I think Corel has done a good job of resolving my own personal quibbles with WP. ---  --- So, if you're looking for a solid performer that seeks to beat competition by improving itself, WPX3 is representative of what you're looking for
I like the product and bought it after having the individual versions on a couple of PCs.  It was easy to setup and I love the feature set.  The vsmon.exe file uses a lot of memory, though, and the PC seems to slow down some. 
My friend told me it was unbelivably fun and said if u like a good laugh It`s a MUST HAVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
If a book makes me look forward to mid-life - I am all over it! This book was actually required reading for my course study in human development - what a find!  Here, Harvard researcher and bestselling author, Joan Borysenko, takes the cycles of a woman's life and divides them into 7 year increments. Along the journey, she also makes a great case for debunking old myths about women and aging.?That's a Big 10-4, Ms. Borysenko! I find myself constantly at odds with the "beauty" images that the media gives us.  I mean, come on, why 'o why are we more often rewarding people for how they look and less for what they contribute to society?   ---  --- Perhaps it's escapism - I tell myself (in effort to sleep at night).  Yet, after reading Borsyenko's, book I'm reminded that, yes, it's good to follow intellectual pursuits. And, yes, there's differences between women and men.  According to Borysenko, women are most often motivated by what they can contribute to society, family, and how to make a difference in the world.  Men tend to define themselves by their work.  Most telling!  Anyhow, I won't give away the store here - but in my opinion, if you are of the female persuasion, you will not want to miss this read.  
I wore this shirt just once. It's almost transparent. Not worth it even if you get it for free
I found the film, "Malice" to be a very intriguing and interesting murder mystery. Sure, there are a lot of twist's in the film, however, that is what I found to be very good about this film. Especially the way these twist's were done. There will be no spoilers in this review. The film begin's with murders occuring in a small college town. Andy Safian (Bill Pullman) is a college dean who happens to be suspected of these killings. All circumstantial. Moreover, he is having problems with his wife (Nicole Kidman). Something happens to her, and she blames Andy for this. [To tell you would give away the film] ---  --- It seems as if one of Andy's old school friends is now a practicing surgeon (Alec Baldwin). Therefore she decides to leave him and sues both the medical facility that caused her such grief, and the Doctor (Balwin) in particular who caused this grief to her. But there is more to the story than meets the eye. There are several stories going on at once. First, you have a serial killer, secondly you have a distraught wife (Kidman) blaming her ex-husband and his Doctor friend for what has happened to her. But there is more to her than the viewer suspect's. I will leave this to you to discover. The film is better than the reviews warrant. It is a very suspenseful film full of twists. Recommended!  
I've been looking for black sport socks for a long time!  Finally, a black comfortable, cushy sport sock of medium thickness.  I'm completely satisfied
This review covers the FB11NR: same unit with slightly different control pushbuttons and with an IR remote. ---  --- Somehow, i had deluded myself into thinking that the spinning massagers under each foot were powered. Nope... basically just built-in plastic versions of those usually wooden massaging rollers that one rolls one's foot upon. That's fine, yet when i want to relax, i'm not thinking about moving my feet. Fortunately, those are removable, and removal is exactly what happened. ---  --- The killer was that the center massage wheel, which IS supposed to be powered and IS supposed to spin, was D.O.A. This unit went back to the store, and we bought an FB21 instead. Amazon has no listing for that model, so i can't give a full review on it. It was good enough to keep. ---  --- Both the FB11NR and the FB21 share some traits. Neither one really keeps water anywhere near its original temperature. Sound levels vary from fairly quiet to quite loud, depending upon the operating mode chosen (i did dB measurements on the FB21, but since Amazon doesn't list that one, you don't get to see them). The FB21 seems to have slightly better build quality, and everything worked out of the box, so we kept that one
I never received this product so I can not review it.  I ordered it through AMAZON.COM and they never sent the magazine.  DO NOT ORDER MAGAZINES THROUGH AMAZON.COM.  I called customer service and being re-routed several times I finally spoke to a customer service agent who said the magazine is on its way. That was two weeks ago and I still have not received any copies of the magazine.  DO NOT ORDER THROUGH AMAZON.COM.  Order all magazines directly through the publisher or any other way.  AMAZON.COM was a terrible experience.  If I ever recieve the magazine I am sure the first issue will show that I started receiving the magazine at the order date so I will have to fight with them to have my subscription end with the my first delivered magazine
I pronate and the light eight material gave me breathability as well as a sturdy base for my running.  I not only trained up to 40 miles a week with these but I ran two half marathons and the NYC Marathon with this exact sneaker.  When they became worn from the wear and tear?  I bought another pair - exact one.  These sneakers lasted me half a training season PLUS the marathon.  Not ages of running but probably close to 200 miles.  I highly recommend them.  And the color is fun, too
This game is fun to play but not the greatest game either. Of course the movie is way better than the game. The game is pretty easy and is short considering there are 18 levels. The storyline in the beginning could have been alittle better as well. Some of the missions are pretty hard but after you pass the tough ones it just gets easy again. All in all it's a good game. I would recommend it. The graphics are good , I do like how they put some storyline in from the movie. It's not to bad of a game to play.
I would spend a little more money and buy a better quality camera. The picture quality was not good at all. I previously owned another Kodak camera with the same Megapixels and the picture quality on that camera was much better. Just after a year of using the Kodak C300 camera, it stopped working and I did not use it that much. I now own the Sony Cybershot DSC-W50 that takes great pictures, I haven't had any problems with it and I have been using it on an almost daily basis since May 2006
It was just what I wanted--a relatively stress-free low-impact workout that you can do while zoning out in front of the tv. Takes about 30 minutes to put together. It's quiet, stowable, and fun. My ten-year-old likes it, too. I don't have any problems keeping my feet in the straps as long as I'm wearing shoes, so maybe the people who were complaining about that issue hadn't been wearing shoes. A really nice little machine, and what a great price
It was an awkward mess - smushing gel over my teeth with a piece of flimsy plastic that barely adhered, much less fit securely.  It'd probably be easier without the trays.  I don't know if they work or not.  I gave up.  I want my Crest Whitestrips back
Decent size cubby to hold toys in the bath, but one side doesn't seem to want to stick to the walls
I use the Dusty Pink, and I have never ever used a blush that looks so natural, and makes my skin glow so healthy.  With or without the mineral foundation from Youngblood; just lovely.  Highly recommended
Very disappointed in the cheap quality and dull color. It doesn't look as nice as what they show on the internet. I returned it for a refund
The swing was easy to install and I did not need extra tools or help.  Unfortunately the tree branch was not exactly horizontal and so it was difficult to make the swing horizontal.  It was even enough, however, and I put my daughter in.  The swing was tilting a little far forward but I could not adjust it.  The worst part was getting her out.  The tray was near IMPOSSIBLE to undo from its locked position.  I guess I did not need to worry about her falling out, I was just wondering if I would be able to get her out at all.  I'll be donating the swing
I have read Baldacci's first four novels and have immensely enjoyed all of them.  This one, however, is just awful.  Not only the character's dialogue but even the story itself is written like a really bad detective movie.  The only thing I can think of to compare it to is this :  There was a series of Calvin and Hobbes cartoons where Calvin imagines himself as a private detective and they are written like the old detective shows, with lame lines like "The gun was loaded, and so was I".  That is exactly what this book is like, except it goes on for 400 pages.  There isn't a single interesting character in this book, in my opinion.  You just have to slog your way through the book to get to the end.  It's the Bataan Death March of novels.  I hope this is an aberration - I'll certainly give him another try since the first four novels that I read were so good.  But one more stinker like this one and I'll drop his name from my reading list
great casting, dancings and performance. well, if you keep abusing yourself, nobody can save you. this so talented broadway genius simply couldn't himself to mess up many women's lives and stubbornly doing harm to himself, chain-smoking, addicting to prescriptioned drugs, sleeping around, hopping from one woman to another. he created so many personal disasters around himself, dedicated himself to broadway musicals but never took care of himself. burning his own life candle from both ends day and night. when the curtain in the theatre falls, it would go up again in the next evening, but when the curtain of your life decides to come down on you, it won't go up again. a wonderful movie with a hidden warning lesson to those who in the entertaining show biz
I was very surpised at the poor quality of these stockings. I have purchased Leg Avenue before and found them to be excellent, however these were like fifty cent bought off the back of someone's truck brand. As a matter of fact I've bought better fifty cent off the back of the truck stockings!Leg Avenue is now off my list! Of course, if they priced them three for a dollar,now that might be worth the price
This Eeyore is so much fun.  I gave it a 4 because the little butterfly is too easy to lose, but if Mom and Dad are diligent to keep the part with the toy and teach Baby to keep them together, I think there is also something to be learned with this, plus the fact that he is so DARN cute and the little voice is sweet and soothing. "GOOD NIGHT BABY."  Just precious.  Baby quickly learns that Eeyore only works with the butterfly rattle.  I thought the ears would be easy to break, but they have taken a lickin' from my grandson and still work.    Nana Ka
Simple. It loads like a blaze. Sure all the new frills and features like easy annotations are neat, but the speed of 7.0 alone makes it worth every dime. Especially if your current Acrobat is the half-baked clunky 6.0.x that burst through the gates before it had legs.
FROM AMAZON.CA --- --------- ---  --- The Action Replay MAX is more than just a video game enhancer (VGE)....or at least it claims to be. My version is quite old yet but it claims to include a Region-free DVD player and a memory card compression utility (squeeze more saves onto your memory card). I have not used either of these features personally, but I have heard horror stories about the memory manager corrupting gamesaves and whole memory cards; some reusable, some permanently damaged. This and the fact that you must load up the action replay software to access saves that use the memory manager turned me off of using it. However, the real reason I bought the ARMax was for its codes and I'll get to those in a second. ---  --- The ARMax, like the newer Gamesharks, loads its software from a CD. This is a major annoyance for me. Every time you load a game you must insert the ARMax memory card (which does I don't know what) and CD, go sit on the couch and wait for the software to load, choose your codes, then get up and put the actual game DVD in and wait for it to load. You can't simply turn on your PS2 and go sit down. In the old days of cartridge gaming you would snap the VGE between the game and the console so you could turn on the console and go sit down. The early generation Gamesharks had a little box that would attach to an expansion slot on the PS1 or N64 and that was it. If you wanted it to load before the game, you turned on its switch. Even if the ARMax was perfect in every other way (and it's not, btw), it would get a maximum of 4 stars as long as you had to boot it from a CD first. I mean, why can't the memory card part of it at least hold the codes for even just the current game you're playing after the system is shut off or reset so you don't have to load the software EVERY D@MN TIME. ---  --- Ok, rant over. On to the codes. The user interface for the ARMax is better than the Gameshark. Functionally, they are very similar of course, but the ARMax just feels cleaner and easier to use. It offers a Beginner interface that includes descriptions of code functions (not for user-entered ones though, if I remember right), and a more robust Expert Mode. On big advantage, in theory, that the ARMax has over the Gameshark is its ability to update itself using your PS2's broadband connection. The upshot is you can download new codes for your favorite games fairly quickly instead of manually typing them all in using the controller. The dark cloud to go with this silver lining is that you have no control over which codes you download; its all or nothing. And since these updates are stored on your memory card (not the ARMax one), it will quickly fill up with codes and gamesaves for games 99% of which you will NEVER play! No wonder the ARMax has the option to come with 16 or 32MB of space on its memory card. It's to store all the useless codes! Any entered codes you choose to apply will either work, do nothing, or lock up the game. I have come across all, though to ARMax's credit, mostly the former. The absurd choice forcing you to download and save updates for every game in the PS2 library, when you may want just one, loses the ARMax another star. A note about manually entering codes: The sub-headings and folders for a game have their own codes that must be entered if you want them to show up in the game's code list. ---  --- Finally, as mentioned in the reviews by Bret Morris and Glenn Nichols (Amazon.ca), the ARMax initially did not work with the new revision of the fat PS2 a couple years ago AT ALL. This happened for me as well. I returned three PS2s and two ARMaxes before I realized it was a defect in all current versions (at the time) of ARMax. I had to send away and get a new disc direct from Intec which now works as well as expected. Since the ARMax has been on shelves for several years since I bought mine, I assume any bought today would not have this problem. However, at the time there was no way to find out about this problem without contacting Intec personally. Retailers were not aware of the problem and no notices were posted on the CodeJunkies web site. This inadequate treatment of a widespread problem drops ARMax down to two stars. ---  --- In my opinion, if you're in the market for a VGE, both ARMax and Gameshark have their pros and cons. I would assume both have released newer versions with newer features than the ones I have. Looks at the specs, assume nothing, and don't be afraid to e-mail the companies requesting details regarding any features you have questions about. ---  --- I apologize for the length of this review, but I find there are very few in-depth reviews of VGEs on the web or in print. Maybe reviewers feel they are above using VGEs, I don't know.
I bought these because they are described as: "100% all-natural dry roasted almonds".  Now I read the label states that these contain: maltodextrin, modified potato starch, sugar, MSG, autolyzed yeast extract, modified corn syrup solids, modified corn starch, salt...     --- 
I went to a sports store and all they carried were sportline pedometers.  I really didn't know which one to buy so I bought this one because it was more attractive than the bright yellow one and it was more expensive than the 340 so I thought it was better somehow.  Even though it says that it measures steps accurately on the packaging, it doesn't actually display it.  It only uses it to calculate the distance that you've walked.  I was very annoyed by this because the 340 does track and display the number of steps walked.  I got over it but the thing keeps resetting in my pocket.  I'm just going to buy another pedometer.  One that displays the steps walked and has a cover
Whether William Golding deserved Nobel Prize or not is still a debatable point, but it is true that he wrote one marvelous book, and its name is `Lord of the Flies.' But let's not talk about the differences between the book and the film for a while - because after all no one I am afraid can bring the multi-layered world of words onto the screen. Even those who loved the 1963 version would admit that. You can interpret the meaning of `Lord of the Flies' but who can really visualize it, or the imaginary conversations of Simon for that matter? ---  --- The biggest problem of Harry Hook's new version is not the changes done to the film. The boys are American military school cadets, using dirty words frequently, but those parts didn't annoy me much. Real problem is something more essential to the film, which is storytelling. In short the 1990 film doesn't know what it wants to be. On the film's video cover you can read (and I quote) `this stunning adventure explores the deep dark corner of the human soul." Well, not exactly. ---  --- For as adventure story it lacks pace; the film always feels rushed and often needs better editing. As allegory it needs more distinctive personalities for each character. The conflict between Ralph and Jack should be clearer, and Piggy's role should be more than that of a whining fat boy. And don't forget Simon, who sees things, it is true, but definitely not those things that the film actually shows us. ---  --- It is a pity that the cinematography is so beautiful. It could have been a perfect backdrop against which dark allegorical survival story would develop, opposite of optimistic tales of Jules Verne's adventure stories. By watching this film you can follow the story of the book, but find no tension or thought-provoking words in it. ---  --- Balthazar Getty's feature film debut. And Lewis M. Allen, one of the producers of the film, had also produced Peter Brook version in 1963
My husband and I got these headphones for his 9-year old son who lives in Ocala, Florida. He loves them. They aren't too heavy, and really allow him to listen carefully. When a 9-year old can concentrate on something for longer than five minutes, you know it's a good product! They took some getting used to, but after three weeks, he's doing very well, and doesn't even notice that he has them on
I love this program!!! it is so great to see the dimensions, wall colors, decorating ideas at my fingertips
I've had a ton of these, and I take them on camping trips with kids where the main activity is playing in big mud fields.  I've had them in my pocket while rolling around in the mud, taken it out, shot a few pics, put it back in the pocket with no problem.  (See pictures for examples of "mud photos") ---  --- A couple of times I've had them stand up to so much moisture and abuse that the cardboard falls off, but still had beautiful pictures every time, no jams or over-exposures.   ---  --- I've found the two pack at WalMart on sale for $8.99 a couple of times, and you absolutely cannot be that deal.  ---  --- This is my favorite disposable camera, and I've tried them all.
Coming from a listener with a broad scope of musical preferences, Blues has always been a multi-faceted genre which can be broken down into the categories:Soulful Blues, Drinking Blues and Guitar Blues. "B.B King - Live At The Regal" is one of those recordings that just happens to capture all three. ---  --- This recording is dear to my heart as I can remember far back as first or second grade when my grandmother (God Bless) used to play this on 8-track. She used to love herself some Riley "Blues Brother" King. This recording ALWAYS seemed to be in the player when my cousins and I would come over to visit and rest assured, You WILL hear it before you left to go home. ---  --- At that time, Being the young naive kid that I was, I remember saying that I hated it and that it was old folks music. All grown up now, In an age where real music is practically unheard of in terms of what these young artists of today release on CDs, I have a newfound respect for real stuff like this. So instead of sitting around burning your brain cells trying to understand what this new generation is calling itself creating, You have decided to come to one of the first sources for good old fasioned real music....The Blues. ---  --- In my opinion, "BB King Live At The Regal" is one of Mr. King's best recordings and with myself not being a big fan of live albums, This is one of those rare live pieces that captures the essence of what a live recording should sound like. Maybe not so much in terms of the musicianship but the overall performance of those involved. The arrangements were put together nicely & the musicians were all in a very tight vibe on this album and whoever was on the mixing board did an excellent job of capturing this essence. BB's pickin' and crooning mixed with the superb playing by the band make this a wonderful place to start for the blues or BB King enthusiast.  ---  --- It sounds as if it was made in a tasteful nightclub full of grown people who wanted to hear good music while having a good time. The ladies were screaming and the gentlemen were cheering and BB was playing at his best. The only gripe I have about this disc is that it is very short; which was typical considering the age and time that it was made but still essential and a solid lesson for anyone interested in Blues (especially Blues Guitar). I recommend getting this and BB's "Live In Cook County Jail". They both are live albums and both have some of the same songs on them but they were done in a different way and should still be heard. ---  --- Good choice if you get this one.  
i ordered this item, and reding the other review i expected good results however i havent seen any results at all. i have to say theres just no subistute for old fashioned exercise
Good knife to throw in your survival kit. Compass is worthless but other than that it seemed well made
After trying just about every other pricier wiper blade on the market, and being disappointed every time, I decided to spring the extra money for this one (no, they are not cheap) and see if paying the extra money made all that much of a difference. I only bought one initially, on a rainy day when my driver side wiper had flown off the car on my way to work, and then immediately ran back and got one for the passenger side, too, after I'd only gone a mile down the road. These wipers are incredible. I swear my windshield looks better now than it ever has. No smearing, no streaking, and complete water removal. They also work better at removing bugs from the windshield in conjunction with the car window washer fluid than any other wiper I've ever used. Now I'm curious about the longevity of the wiper blade. I'm hoping they last longer than others, too (given the price.
There is no better way to drive home T.S. Eliot's "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" than to hold a peach and read: ---  --- "Shall I part my hair behind? Do I dare to eat a peach? [CHOMP] --- I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach." --- (And shall I dare yet again to eat a peach and teach?) [MUNCH MUNCH] --- "I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each." --- (But I do not care to preach; I only dare to eat a peach.) [SLURP] ---  --- It gives me an intelligent excuse to snack while I'm lecturing
Karaoke Revolution Party is a fantastic game with great songs, great easy gameplay and perfect party game features. If you've never tried a karaoke game, now's the time to play. ---  --- First, the basic setup. You get to FULLY customize your character. We're talking black, white, male, female, heavy, skinny, athletic. Then you go for hair styles, hair colors, outfits down to the shoes and jewelry. You can evey use your EyeToy to scan your FACE onto the face of the character. It is simply amazing. ---  --- Then we go onto the song list. I own probably every karaoke game out for the 3 main systems. I love karaoke games. This song list is by far my favorite song list of all time - and it's true for my boyfriend as well. There are a good mix of jumping songs, slow romantic songs, rocking songs and more.  ---  --- In other karaoke games you have to go through unlocking the venues and songs. Because this is a party game, they pretty much give you everything up front, with a few exceptions. You do unlock a few songs and a ton of characters / outfits as you go, to keep things interesting. A few standouts include the Elvis outfit and the cat outfit. ---  --- In addition to being able to sing along in both single player and duet modes, there are a bunch of fun mini-games. You can compete against other players, try to play note-matching games and even set up the eye toy so you see your own background in the game.  ---  --- Even better, if you have a dance pad, you can sing and dance at the same time! This is REALLY great for building up your vocal powers. Many people can sing fine if they stand still like a stick, but when you sing in a band you're actually expected to move around and dance. Using the dance pad helps you build up your lung power and timing so that you get those skills. Even if you're not in a band, you can see the challenges that your favorite singers face. ---  --- This game is a TON of fun both with friends in party mode, or just singing along yourself with the songs. Where some of the previous versions of karaoke sometimes had "questionable" versions of songs, with them being obviously different from the original, these songs are great sounding and many times I didn't have to look at the song bar at all to sing along with them. ---  --- Highly, highly recommended!! ---  --- Rating: 5/5 ---  --- NOTE: The previous reviewer says this has the Aretha Franklin version of Natural Woman. I'm rather sure it's the Carole King version
This Pur Minerals Starter Kit is a great introduction to this brand.  I am absolutely in love with the 4-in-1 Pressed Mineral Makeup (included in the kit). It's so much better than the Bare Escentuals makeup, which I had been using for years. The 4-in-1 provides great coverage, as it is a foundation, concealer, and spf 15 pressed powder all in one. With Bare Escentuals, I was having to buy the mineral veil, foundation and concealer all separately, and I still felt like my dark circles and blemishes were not covered well. Pur Minerals is a wonderful makeup, very lightweight, and even the brush is soft on my skin! I highly recommend it
I've used much better electric shavers in the past. I find it hard to hard to get a close shave but easy to scrape my skin.
I got this message from the recipient's mother: ---  --- He loves it, really! well-made drawer - shelf design. It's heartwarming when he settles down industriously using his art supplies
This game I purchased for my sons. They both told me they enjoyed this game. A little tough at first but with any new game, you have your challenges. If you want a game that is not too easy, this is the one! Have fun and don't let losing take the fun away. It is a game to be played and it will enhence your skills
I am a Friends fan and I really enjoyed this game. The questions vary in difficulty, and the narration by the characters is a nice feature. ---  --- Regarding the issues with the keyboard, the keys for each player are indeed very close together. Also, when two players can answer the same question at the same time, it's easy to press the wrong key by mistake. But I guess in time you can get used to the keys. ---  --- I didn't have a problem installing the game, although I have a CD recorder and recording software installed. I didn't choose the full instalation, since the CD has to be in the drive anyway, but the game runs properly, it didn't seem to freeze when reading from the CD. ---  --- Compared to SceneIt, it's very different. This is a complete trivia game that keeps score and announces the winner. SceneIt is a board game, and the DVD is used to ask questions, and in order to play it as a trivia game you need to keep score with paper and pen
Save your time, money and patience.  This may be the worst book I have read since the equally monotonous, predictable Stone Barrington novel "The Short Forever".  Wow, this one stinks.  Like others, I put up with the shallow characters, ludicrous dialogue and endless parade of showers, boobs and guns to figure out whodunit.  Unfortunately, this book had an ambiguous ending that seeks to be clever but is instead is just stupid.  Who on earth did kill Vance?  And come to think of it, who gives a damn?  I don't what women did to Stuart Woods but he sure seems to hold them in complete contempt.  Every female character, save for Isabel the maid, felt compelled to practically rape our handsome hero.  Each is flawless and gorgeous but also all are dumb, vacuous, self-centered and thoroughly unlikeable - hey a couple are even truly psychotic!  The only normal female character who spared Stone, Mary Ann, unfortunately has a room temperature IQ.  I am hardly a prude, but I lost count of how many women either Vance or Stone made love to in the course of one short novel and felt the need to take a long hot shower to rid myself of the feelings of filth.  Mr. Woods either lives in a world of complete ignorance or the reading public is a lot less discriminating than I thought
i have been playing the madden series since i was a kid and this game is really good. the games  just keep getting better and better as each year passes. everything in this game is worth the money i strongly reccommend it
I know a lot of people liked this book, but I felt like it put too much pressure on me to pack on the pounds.  I didn't realise so much of the book was focused on diet.  It says you should plan on gaining a pound a week, and the more you gain the healthier your babies will be.  Well the first 13 weeks I managed to gain NOTHING, and I felt horrible about it, but food made me so sick the last thing I could do was eat MORE food to try to gain weight.  The book said that according to my starting weight I should try to gain 50 - 60 pounds during my pregnancy!  I decided to stop reading the book, and so far, just going by what my gut says about what to eat and when, I've managed to put on 20 pounds.  My twins are measuring perfectly and are very healthy. ---  --- This book isn't horrible, but I would check it out of a library or borrow it or buy it used, don't spend the $ on a new one... and be prepared to put it down if it doesn't sound right to you
This is one of the many different magazines that you can find at discount or grocery stores with lots of hairstyle pictures. They are usually seasonal meaning 4-5 issues a year. This particular magazine is mostly black & white pictures. At least the issues I've bought were. This is something you would buy if you wanted a new hairstyle that would involve a new cut. A majority of the styles in these magazines are shoulder length styles and above. This is a nice item to have in a hair salon for clients to get ideas while they wait
The "Urban Legend" franchise has been pretty steady for the past couple of years. I just don't understand why this movie was made. It shifts from the slasher feel of the previous two movies and delves into a more supernatural focus. The film is pretty bad. I'm definitely a huge fan of horror movies and it doesn't take a lot to impress me but this was just mediocre.  ---  --- The acting is extremely sub-par and this is especially disappointing because Kate Mara is in the cast. She delivered some pretty good roles in "Nip/Tuck" and "Jack & Bobby" but she goes through this movie, along with the rest of the actors in an incoherent storyline that shifts from scene to scene with no depth. It's hard to care about the characters at all. They just float around with seemingly no purpose. I even almost quit watching the movie halfway but being the avid horror fan I am, I had to continue.  ---  --- There is only one really cool death scene that gave this movie 1 star. It involves a pretty girl and a spider. Most of the rest of the death scenes are just retreads of urban legends the characters talked about in the past two movies. The film even has a cameo scene from "Final Cut" in which a character is watching a porn on the TV.  ---  --- Overall, not even worth a rental. Luckily for me, I didn't have to waste 3 bucks because it was available for free on my Comcast ON Demand.
I was very happy with my purchase.  The company chose to mail it to me via priority mail in order for it to arrive before Christmas.  I was very pleased!!!! ---  --- 
The lived tragic story during the WW2 in a small town of the occupied Czechoslovak. A carpenter is hired " Arian controller "in a modest and humble bottom store where her owner a Jew old lady thinks the best about him, unknowing what' s really going on backstage.  --- I few words a major film told without melodramatic effects, but told with asserted  expression and crude realism.  --- Another amazing evidence of the artistic foreseeing three years previous to the invasion.
i guess it's cheap, but the dial rocks like crazy when you stand on it and shift your weight, so it's pretty hard to get anything more than a ~2-3 pound estimate. which is fine if you're not obsessive, but most people care about that increment...
this thing only lasted 3 days!i mean really.i charged it up and it worked fine.but it only lasted about 5 minutes then i had to charge it again.when i looked under it i noticed that stiafom was breaking off!on the 3rd day i charged it up and it never worked again!!!!!!so i went back to toysrus and renturnd the piece of crud.do never buy this toy!!!!!!!
I saw this at a friends house--so thank God I didn't pay any money to see this bit of idiocy.  I can only assume any good review you read was written by someone with a financial stake in the film!  The guys are not hot...not even lukewarm for that matter.  The acting is terrible.  Please...anyone who had anything to do with this, don't continue in the film industry.  If it was possible to assign negative stars, I would do so for this awful experience.  Run away
Xitel INport Deluxe does what it says it does.  You can plug in any RCA AUX connector into the unit and with the software provided you can record it in stereo to your computer. ---  --- It's a good solid product that does what it says it does but instead of focusing on the features like other reviewers I will point out its minor drawbacks. First, audacity, the a free software that is mentioned in the manual has a tendency to freeze up while recording with the unit.  However, I don't know if it will freeze up on your computer.  Second, if you are thinking about buying this product to turn LPs to CDs, into most LP players don't have RCA AUX plugs and you'll need to buy an addapter.   --- (What they don't tell you in the manual is that if you do this you first need to adjust the volume on the stereo and recorder volume in parallel which is kinda tricky.) Finally, the manual could use more detail because some of the important features weren't mentioned.    ---  --- If you don't mind these drawbacks, you will be able to have many years of recording pleasure if you buy this product
I bought this for my daughter's 1st birthday after seeing an ad for the entire set of Chicco Happy Garden products.  My daughter loves the Little Tikes set that is at her daycare and this looked similar but much cuter.  The eggplant has been a bit of a disappointment.  She would sit on it and rock for a few seconds at first but would quickly lose interest.  Now that we have had the eggplant for 3 months, it has been completely shoved aside.  It just doesn't rock much.  I can't imagine a child over 1 wanting to play with it.  The eggplant has very little curve to it and is pretty boring. I would stick to the Little Tikes set.  
This is a well done game, especially if you liked the movie.  Characters voices and behavior are consistent with the movie and there's a cute storyline to the game. ---  --- There are a number of stages that you follow in order, completing one to move to the next. ---  --- There's a pretty small age window that its good for -- I'd say about 6 to 10.  Under 6, the stages are too hard.  Over 10 they're sort of easy and not that engaging -- you can fly thru pretty quickly. ---  --- It would be a bit better if you could jump around and play the "games" that you enjoy instead of having to go sequentially, but it's still well done and worth buying
(this review is of the Spyware edition) --- NIS takes 25Megs of ram - ok for an all-in-one (if you have <256Megs your lightweight CPU can't carry enough armor to make Windows really Zero-day Net safe IMHO) ---  --- NIS has most of the features I look for in a firewall/spyware/virus scanner/intrusion detector, BUT  --- half don't work right, and some that do seem to fight every attempt to make them work. ---  --- Even after LiveUpdate this week, --- One buggy automatic firewall rule autoloaded, and port 80 was open listening half 'naked' on the Internet. --- I replaced it, and at the first passing probe my rule was erased, autoreplaced, naked again. --- Only after I stumbled onto the secret trick (add a block all rule after the pass rules) did it close it. --- It took 11 clicks (!) just to add the block all rule - miserable! --- The log is a nightmare - pages of long sentences explaining "permitted once" 200 times, no actual info ---  until I click on one of them. What's worse is, none of them I checked WERE "permitted once" IIRC. ---  --- NIS detected 2 trojan/spywares, but could not remove either. ---  --- Enabling program component monitoring started an avalanche of popups, all suggesting I block access, but I actually DO want IE to access the internet.  --- Running Windows update brought a popup asking if 100's more dll's are ok. How would I know? I do want Windows updated.  --- Great feature in theory, totally useless even if you know the names of every evil dll not yet invented. ---  --- If you have more than 1 or 2 programs not in the automatic ruleset, plan to either "permit all" or spend many hours actually writing the same set of 3 rules over and over for every autoupdating program you use - assuming you understand TCP vs UDP etc. Why no "permit all local + DNS + outbound port 80" choice? That would mean 1/10 the work! Jetico lets me pick "web browser" ruleset, so its UI from Hell gets used once per category. ---  --- After spending all day and half the night getting it working, I discover that it is not possible to save my precious rules - or to reload them. I would be less furious if I had a fresh install of windows, but not much. ---  --- All good, until a program autoupdates, and 3 more rules to write. Too angry for words. --- Jetico lets me clone the old rules or edit them to update the program sig. ---  --- I would not use NIS if you paid me 10 times its price.
The attachment isn't textured enough to stay where I put it. As I ride the entire assembly slowly spins around the handle under my hand
I was happy enough with the function of Office XP, and held off upgrading for a long time.  What pushed me over was when I switched to using Outlook as my email client, accessing quite a few POP3 email accounts for various websites.  Getting a spam filter to work smoothly under that circumstance was nasty: I spent many hours in addition to the fees for programs that were clunky and could never be kept working. ---  --- Well, Office 2003's Outlook comes with it's own spam filter.  It works, it's simple and it's unobtrusive. ---  --- The other programs have a nicer look and a few bells and whistles, but the upgrades I appreciate most are in Outlook
Don't know where else to find a garter panty set (arrived fast too) for this price. They say economy, so wasn't expecting much, but we're still enjoying this set to spice up special evenings! We bought the One Size (for a size 8) and it is perfect and adjusts
Love it.  Sort of a metallic red with a soft touch rubber feel.  Some of the soft touch is coming off at the corners with wear but it's still red which is nice.  I will probably get another color on it for spring.  The fit is so snug on the phone that ppl actually ask me where I got my razr since the Sprint red is a little different.  Also maintains all openings for data cables etc
Finally!  I've been looking for a good bust enhancer for several years. These enhancers are well-shaped and incredibly comfortable.  When ordering, go ahead and get the B/C size.  Even if you are an A or low-B. These inserts are a little heavy and require a good bra to conceal and hold them up. I personally recommend using a Fashion Forms pocket bra style 9400 or a Playtex style 4300.  Order a cup size above what you would normally wear.
Well, it is a cool product, and good idea to use. But the bulb was broken in first 3 days. We put the second one on. Dont know how long this second one will last. We used it only few minutes in the morning, when we need to get some cloth out of closet. ---  --- Also, it is not on line product only. I found Bed Bath Beyond has it and CVS has it. They sell 9.99. Without extra bulb. But still, misleading to say online only.
I bought these shoes a few months ago because I liked the style of them. I wore them just about everyday. A couple of people started telling me "you walk kind of funny in those shoes". They caused my ankles to turn in.I was having ankle pain and my doctor confirmed it was from the shoes. The support (curves) of the shoes are poorly designed. I ran into another women wearing them and walking the same way. I asked her about them and she said she too was having ankle pain. I contacted the company who said I could mail them to the company (at my expense) and they would "inspect" them. If they felt it was a "manufacturers defect" they would replace them with the SAME product. Little good that would do. ALSO If they felt it was not a defect they would just send them back with a note explaining their decision.Don't waste your money and cause yourself pain too. The company may say "they stand by their merchandise" but they don't mean it!
The BraBaby does not function as claimed.  The wholething came apart with the first wash.  This device isway too flimsy
Daughter plays it all the time.  Pretty Quick shipping.  Brand new.  Excellent seller
I own many watches, including some very expensive ones. Such quality & looks for 1/10 of the price ! This watch is classy and the quality is second to none. Awesome !
I was very disappointed in this product.   It is for a child and yet the wood string holder was not even attached to the guitar.  This product lasted a whole two days before the part fell off and you could no longer use the guitar.   The tuners also were unable to tighten so you basically had a piece of useless wood shaped like a guitar.
This stuff is great...and we can't find it in our grocery store in Galveston Co. Texas. Now I don't have to wait until we fly to the Northwest! Very cool
What a horrendous experiment in comedy...if you like Jerry Lewis, I guess you'll love this travesty of a film.  If you are a film snob, you will love it.  Personally, as neither, I am grossly disappointed and just really didn't get "the joke."  It was trite and dull....there was no point....the plot...technology encroaching on humanity....well, good try, but again not for me.  If I am looking for a laugh, I will watch a good Coen brothers film
For years I used PowerQuest's Drive Image 7 for backups. It's rock solid and totally dependable. When Symantec aquired PowerQuest they rolled the underlying technology of Drive Image 7 into Norton Ghost. The result is a very capable and reliable package that can backup partitions or entire drives and also provides support for incremental backups. Most importantly, like Drive Image 7, it provides for emergency recovery of your system. Just boot from the Ghost CD and restore the backup (restore point) that you select. I've tested this process by making both full system backups and subsequent incremental backups, and then restoring the system from those backups. The process works flawlessly. If you need to restore to a different physical drive (replaced a failed drive, etc), the process requires a few extra selections, but is still very straightforward. Just take the time to read the manual. ---  --- I've seen Acronis True Image recommended by some both here and elsewhere. I've tried Acronis and find it lacking in one major respect: It simply is not reliable. During trials, I made backups with Acronis. Acronis indicated that the backups were successful but, when attempting to make a system recovery just minutes later, Acronis indicated that the backups were corrupted and could not be used. The backups were worthless. ---  --- When purchasing backup software remember that bells and whistles don't count for anything. The only thing that counts is reliability. It must be able to reliably restore your system. Norton Ghost passes that test with flying colors. --- 
I enjoy this mouse. Usually, I don't like using the touch pad on laptops but after deciding to buy a mouse, I had to look for a specific mouse that would fit into my lifestyle as a student. I have small hands and I hate carrying out heavy objects in my bookbag. Since I have to lug my laptop around, I needed a mouse that didn't take a lot of space, is good enough to withstand constant shifting in my laptop, and that worked well with my needs. ---  --- Pros: Small size, optical, scrolling tab, and portability --- Cons: Sometimes the mouse jumps around a bit on its own. BUT this happens only a few times every few weeks - so it's not often enough to cause a problem for me. ---  --- Enjoy
No doubt about it.  This book covers the history of the Border Patrol.  However, it falls far short of what it ostensibly bills itself and ends up more as a "fluff piece" than anything else. ---  --- As someone who has not only served as a Senior Border Patrol Agent (13 years) but also a Border Patrol union president and outspoken critic of the agency, I have studied this agency inside and out without the affects of tunnel vision that typically accompany the job (many say a necessity).  Pacheco, as an active agent (when he wrote the book at least), appears headed in the right direction with the book and then suddenly veers off target.  His somewhat ambiguous message that border security is a difficult task is obviously an attempt to straddle the line (I apologize for the pun) so as not to appear too contentious or controversial.  Did he need to seek agency approval for publication since he was actively employed?  If so, then the credibility issue leaps out and the book is worth the historical content alone if nothing else.  If he did not need agency approval and was truly writing without restraint, then he failed to accurately convey the real state of the Border Patrol and border security.   ---  --- Simply put, the Border Patrol, as with most of the Homeland Security subcomponents is disintegrating.  Remember the incompetence of FEMA (a Homeland Security subcomponent)?  Well, multiply that incompetence times ten.  Heard about the poor morale of FEMA employees?  Multiply that problem by one-hundred and you have an accurate picture of the Border Patrol.  A Border Patrol in which the vast majority of otherwise employable agents spend ninety-percent of their time trying to get out.  Those that choose to stay in do so only because of the comparatively worse off agencies in DHS.  The bottom line is that as a former agent, I lose sleep at night knowing what I know.    ---  --- Pacheco did cover the rigorous training regimen accurately even if it bordered on propaganda.  That alone may attract candidates to the difficult and completely unrewarding position of U.S. Border Patrol Agent.  The field stories are completely unappealing to anyone who served more than a week in a law enforcement position unless they are reading about their own exploits.   ---  --- Read the book for enjoyment and homage.  Just don't expect critical analysis.  In fact, this book would be an enjoyable read at Stewarts Bridge (for you IB agents in San Diego).
We have the Baby Bjorn Step Stool, Potty Chair, Little Potty, and now the Toilet Trainer. Hind sight is 20/20. The Toilet Trainer and Step Stool is all you need. Our initial thought was to have the Potty Chair for home and the Little Potty for trips. The reality is our daughter would sit on her potty then want to sit on the toilet like Mommy and Daddy. We balanced her on the toilet before we decided to get the toilet trainer. No more balancing acts on the toilet. She can use her step stool to get on the Toilet when she wants. The toilet trainer travels well, fits all types of toilets, easy to install, remove, and clean! The Potty Chair and Little Potty are fantastic quality but you might as well go with the Toilet Trainer from the start
Does what it needs to... The hell with Palm that changes stylus with every new model
We love this item. I was so upset when we got this stroller due to the fact of not having a spot for a drink. This item solved the problem. Highly recommended
Reviewer Alianore's opinion "Rather too indulgent of its subject" is a very accurate portrayal of Weir's work. I will try to add something to that near perfect review. (Note: I listened to the unabridged audiobook of "Queen Isabella", 22 hrs on 18 CDs). ---  --- The first half or so of this biography is mostly enjoyable, loaded with period details. The last third is the worst: Weir's fawning dedication to a glorious rehabilitation -- nay, elevation -- of Queen Isabella to the role of long-suffering, much-wronged, highly-deserving, and late-redeemed Just Queen of England. ---  --- This book is really "subjective, rhetorical biographal dramatization". I do not consider it to adhere to an academic standard for objective history and analysis. It is rhetoric because of the endless "weasel words" (and expressions) used copiously throughout: "Some say", "It has been said", "Many believe", "Therefore we may assume", "It can be inferred" ... this isn't just an attribute of her style ... it *is* her style comprehensively. These expressions occur many hundreds of times, commonly in conjunction with Wier's subjective analyses that present her beloved Isabella in the best possible light, always giving her every benefit of the doubt and shifting negative interpretations onto other persons. ---  --- Equally irksome is Weir's double-standard of historical psychological analysis. She is always 'declaring' for us the contents of Isabella's thoughts. Remarkable gift she has for this. Many times Weir reasonably states that modern psychological and socialogical interpretations of medieval history are inherently invalid or at least not meaningful. But then moments later she will portray Isabella's actions from a 21st century point of view ... always telling the reader how Isabella must have, might have, could have, would have been thinking and feeling about one situation after another ... often presented in a positive way that is only supported by a present-day psychosocial interpretation of 800 year old history. This isn't historical writing, it is historical op-ed, with an obvious agenda. ---  --- I don't loathe this work, it is enjoyable in many parts for its color characterizations and depth of detail. The narrator of the audio book has a wonderful voice and good pacing. But this is highly flawed in its editorial approach to historical biography. (Other egregious examples of such hagiography include Edmund Morris' "Rise of Theodore Roosevelt" and "Theodore Rex". I could not complete either of those since Morris is so obviously enthralled by his subject, lovingly lionizing him in every sappy sentence. Yuck. Really.) ---  --- If prefer more history when reading (or listening to) history. And much, much less editorial subjectivity, retroactive psychology, biased interpretation and rhetorical postulation. The only way I could enjoy "Isabella" by Weir is to accept her bias up front and listen accordingly, taking it with "several pounds of salt" as the above referenced reviewer advises. ---  --- 2.5/5
I had to buy my 4 year old a new Leap Pad after his old one wore out.  He is currently obsessed with Spiderman so I grabbed this one.  I didn't realize it came with the Spiderman book I was going to buy him soon anyway (saved me $15)!   So far the new Leap Pad and Spiderman book have been a huge hit! 
After having installed the unit for 43 days, the suction cup snapped off the plastic mounting.  This was a spantaneous break while driving sending the unit "Flying"! Very dangerous!! ---  --- Tomtom would not replace the unit, as the claim that paart is warranted only for 3 weeks! buyer beware.  See the TomTom forum for description and picture: ---  --- [...] ---  --- and other links to the base issue
This is by far my favorite version of this classic story and the most authentic and true to the spirit of the book.  The cast and direction are excellent and the setting is gorgeous.  This film will delight both children and adults with it's adventure, suspense, and innocent romance.  It's a little spooky in some scenes, but of the fun rather than truly scary kind.  This story has a very positive underlying message but doesn't preach, rather it expresses it in subtly beautiful ways as the characters unlock the mysteries of the Secret Garden and of themselves.   No matter what age you are, this is a thoroughly enjoyable, uplifting, perhaps even transformative film - don't miss it
a lot of people seem to snub their noses at Let's Talk About Love because it wasn't the career-defining album as the album that preceded it, but all in all, it's still a fantastic snapshot for Celine's career in 1997. ---  --- Celine shocked almost everyone by releasing a follow-up so shortly (Falling Into You was still in the top 40 on the charts at the time) but it was very worthy. ---  --- Among my faves on the album include "The Reason", "Immortality" with The Bee Gees (for a "Celine-less" version of the song, check out The Bee Gees' 2-disc hits collection from 2001), "Love Is On The Way", the very funky "Treat Her Like A Lady", "To Love You More" and the beautiful singalong title track.   This album also housed "My Heart Will Go On" which certainly helped push this album to sales over 9 million.   While it was a song that you wanted to smash the stereo at the time because it was being played every five minutes, I'd say enough time has passed that once again you can enjoy and appreciate this beautiful, powerful ballad. ---  --- With "Falling Into You" and this album, Celine was the #1 female artist for a period, becoming a superstar right as Mariah was abandoning AC for r&b, as Alanis was going on hiatus for awhile, and when Shania was taking off but hadn't yet exploded into major-superstardom.  Love her or malign her (it seems fashionable to do the latter), she became one of the premier voices in Adult Contemporary and won over a large audience.  I haven't been a fan at all of her last few albums, but if she ever comes back with an album like these two, I'd snatch it up in a heartbeat
 I bought this sweet little thing because I am planning a day in NYC and don't want to bring along my regular camera, which is bulky. This camera is nice and small and would fit in any purse or coat pocket. It has 5 MP and a 3X optical zoom which is great for the price. The pictures I took outside turned out outstanding. Inside pics were a bit pixelated, but I may have had the settings wrong. The camera is easy to use right out of the box. ---  --- Perfect for a second camera to keep on you just in case
My kids (age 5, 7 and 10) love this movie.  I actually bought the VHS version many years ago when the movie first came out but wanted the DVD so we could watch it in the car when while traveling.  My husband and I originally bought this movie for my little nephew to watch so it's nice that we can share it with our own kids now.  If you love animals, this movie is for you.  The DVD jacket says this movie took a few years to make and I believe it.  It's absolutely amazing how the animals relate to each other.  This has got to be one of the best animal films out there. 
I wouldn't call this a "rocker seat" The kick-stand on it makes it look like a rocker, if you put the stand down..the legs almost touch the floor. You can make it move a little if you have wood floors, but not enough to call it a rocker. If you have a very mellow baby, this chair is perfect. My baby likes to sit and stare at the toys. But if you need any type of movement for your baby to stay calm, I wouldn't recommend this chair. ---  --- The music/sounds on it is very nice, not annoying at all. I don't use the vibration on it yet, until my baby can itch his cheeks if needed. The only reason I say 4 stars and not 5 is because it is falsely advertised as a "rocker", other than that, it is very cute, and my baby enjoys it alot!
Lead singer and co-founder David Gates was recently inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.  This album is one prime example of why.  David has consistently provided beautiful melodies with easy, sensitive lyrics.   His last album was a country album called "Love Is Always  Seventeen," which was a genre-crossing mix of pop and country,  co-produced and performed with Billy Dean.  But back to this gem.   "Guitar Man," and "Aubrey" were the big hits off of  this album, and they still stand the test of time.  "Tecolote" is  one of their most unusual departures, and still makes me laugh, while  enjoying its musicality and orignality.  "Didn't Even Know Her  Name" is a poignant lost love song; "Welcome to the Music"  is one of those opening songs bands sometimes did to orient their fans to  what to expect.  Even Larry Knechtel gets in on the vocals with the  intriguing "Picture in My Mind."  It's a great album---in fact,  there's not a bad "Bread" album out there!  Enjoy, and relive  those magical moments of the glorious seventies
I found the product to be made very poorly....all it too is one drop on the floor and the camera battery door cracked and that was is for the camera too....NOT A KID friendly camera at all
waste of money.  does not fit most car seats and the info on the package does not specify this
Man, I've lived all over the world, and while most think that Ramen is a poor college student's meal is missing out.  After a few months of life in Korea, I couldn't get enough of the stuff.  I'm glad to see that it is finally being offered by Amazon.  I now can get a good book and some tasty spicy Ramen.  Life is good
This is a great "linguisa"!  I usually buy mine from a store a few towns away because they have 'HOT' Chorizo Sausage but these have a really great flavor even though they are not 'hot'.  And they are organic.  The fat content is minimal when microwaving for a fast high protein snack yet it's high enough to use only the meat to coat the pan when adding it to scrambled eggs.  And the price is good too.  Free shipping and handling with a nominal purchase makes this a really good buy.  I highly recommend it
Do not like this product at all...the girls on the video are not facing the right way for easy instruction...we have to go the opposite way...very uncool...my daughter started crying, too...i told her it wasn't her fault...you want your child to feel good about themselves and all it does is make them feel like they aren't good enough...do not waste your money
Perhaps Black and Decker got a lot of complaints about an earlier edition of this item-- but I should note first that the one I received today has nice, heavy metal clamps. ---  --- Haven't used it yet but I'm confident it will work well. I'm very impressed by the apparent high quality of construction and fit and finish, as well as design. ---  --- Frankly, I think it would be a good value at the $49.99 Amazon lists as the retail price-- but of course Amazon's price with free shipping is that much better
Before purchasing this product I did the trial of Photoshop for 30 days and then the trial of this one.  Paint Shop Pro (PSP) won hands down!  While they both have similar features, the learning curve on Photoshop is ridiculous...PSP is so intuitive, you can figure out most of the features on your won, but the help feature is great...side by side help as you click through the menus and buttons.  I was impressed!  The red-eye fix is excellent and flexible, with ability to change to pet eye, different eye colors, WOW, there is just so much and all ready to use out of the box without any complicated aftermarket manuals needed.   I have restored some antique photos with very impressive results.  So far I have not had the instability issues that others cite, but my PC is heavy on the graphics capability and memory, perhaps that helps.
Susanna Rowson's "Charlotte Temple" is not the first novel and certainly not the last to deal with the topic of the morally fallen woman. Poor, pitiful Charlotte finds herself in the midst of an immoral and unforgiving world where one transgression sends her on the road to permanent ruin.          Rowson encases her heroine Charlotte Temple within a world of virtue and vengeance. Charlotte has no possible means of escaping her inevitable fate because the author/narrator makes it clear from the onset that she has written this story as a lesson to young woman. She has no real interest in Charlotte as a dimensional character. Charlotte simply serves as a symbol of lost virtue and symbols do not have real emotions or feelings.           "Charlotte Temple" was written in 1794 and became one of the first best sellers of the newly formed America. A morally abhorrent woman who pays for her sins almost always guaranteed a best seller in the eighteenth century and now "Charlotte Temple" has been rediscovered and published in a Scholarly Press edition.          Was this reclamation of Charlotte really necessary? In the past twenty years, feminist scholars have rediscovered authors and texts that have gone out of print or been totally ignored by the literati. Authors such as Anne Plumptre, Frances Burney, Aphra Behn, Sarah Fielding and Charlotte Lennox have been dusted off and given new literary lives. Feminist scholar Cathy Davidson has taken Charlotte Temple in hand and aims to join Rowson to the above list of rediscoveries.          Unfortunately, Rowson does not warrant such treatment. Rowson has a flat, humorless approach to the fallen woman story. Unlike Burney's "Evelina" or "Camilla," Rowson does not imbue her narrative with needed levity.  Her pedantic iron-fisted preaching smothers the modern reader in a moral morass that confounds rather than illuminates.           In many of the fallen women stories, authors would use the genre as a subversive technique to criticize the patriarchal structures. Rowson does engage in such subversion within the novel. She seeks to preach to the young women who may fall victim to the unscrupulous man -- in England and America, it was not considered altogether lady-like to read a novel, so Rowson would be preaching to young women who had already transgressed.          Rowson does not criticize men within the novel. She does not censure Montraville for taking Charlotte as his mistress, impregnating her and abandoning her for a wealthier woman. When he believes that Charlotte has becomes his best friend's mistress, he does not believe that she would soil her reputation even though she has ruined her life by engaging in an illicit affair with him.          He aims to enact revenge upon the friend for acting "dishonorable" against her. Yet if he had not acted dishonorably towards her, she would not have been reduced to a penniless, pregnant ex-mistress scrounging the streets for food and shelter. He never takes responsibility for his role in Charlotte's downfall.  Rowson had the perfect opportunity for savage criticism of the patriarchy with Montraville but she fails to take it.           Instead, Rowson places the blame for Charlotte's ruin on the women within the novel. When Charlotte leaves the safe bosom of her morally upstanding family, she enters into the deviant world of the female who fail to protect her from licentious men.          Madame Du Pont errs in judgment by hiring the morally loose Miss La Rue. Madame Du Pont sets Charlotte's downfall in action. Rowson does not punish the ignorant Madame Du Pont by killing her, she ends up an hysterical mess after the Montraville/Charlotte "elopement."          Miss La Rue, the woman who pushes Charlotte into the arms of Montraville, must be punished for being a promiscuous woman. She ends up poor and begs for her last scrap of food. She ends up dying painfully as Rowson takes the opportunity to lecture her readers on the improper behavior of loose women.          Why would modern readers want to read this? I do not think any intelligent would reader would want to subject themselves to the depressing experience of reading this novel. At 125 pages, it seemed to progress at such an excruciating pace. No character has any shadings. There are no subplots to divert the attention from the static Charlotte. Rowson does nothing to keep our interest.          Unfortunately Rowson has become a heroine to feminist scholars for her feat as the first American woman to have a best-selling novel. That accomplishment is noteworthy as literary trivia, but it does not make for engaging reading
someone get this band a producer and put them in a decent studio, please.  the recording and mixing on this disc is flat-out atrocious.   download a few tracks and hear for yourself. ---  --- 'feburary' and '99 with an anchor' show promise. ---  --- otherwise it's taking back sunday meets hawthorn heights meets fallout boy meets .... you get the picture
Although I was a little put off by a prior review that indicated this product was nearly inedible, we had purchased this salmon jerky at Trader Joe's in smaller packets and really liked it, so we decided to purchase here at Amazon much less expensively.  Yes, this product is very dry, but it also has none of the preservatives included in some of the more moist jerky products out there.  My family liked it, and we are placing a second order.  That other reviewer should send her inedible seven extra packages our way
I really wanted to like this game.. unfortunately for me, it blows. I'd trade it for a migraine if I could. The gameplay is pretty horrible, the sword scenes are reminiscent of PC adventure games circa 1992, where you press the "Attack" key and  swing your sword aimlessly at the bad-guy. The run & gun part of the game is nothing to write home about either. It feels like being teleported into the body of a cracked-out, 1 legged, drunken monkey.  ---  --- Also, I know the graphics aren't the Wii's strong-point, but that is no excuse to regress back to 8-bit. When you're trying to shoot someone across the room, it really sucks when you can't tell them  apart from a flower pot.....or is that a lawn chair? ---  --- The cut scene's were obviously supposed to look like Sin City. I stress the word SUPPOSED cause they were probably strung together by some poor intern after the development team went into hiding. They look like an amateur flash slide-show. Kinda like what your local mom & pop video editor would have put together if your little nephew had gotten his way and had a Sin City themed Bar Mitzvah. ---  --- This game is a joke. Anybody associated with it should be embarrassed.
This case is made for an L6. The L2 uses the same case, so they both fit within this rubber case. However, the keys are laid out differently on the L6 - so this case has the grooves slightly off on the keys. I didn't give it a low rating, because it's well built and is actually a really great product - just wanted to give  other L2 owners a warning. It works well, but it's just a little funky on an L2, but totally usable. For the price, you just can't beat it - and it's a much better option than watching your phone pop into 2 or 3 pieces each time it falls out of your pocket
When I sow this in Amazon and read the spec. and everything on it I knew this is exactly what I'm looking for. It's portable, handy, and it's easy to use. The video has a great picture on it as well as the picture too. You can even download MP3 Music and use it to make music video, or any music of your own. Here's what you do,  Output the audio to a power Amp/ speaker so the performer will hear the music let the performer lipsink the music and start shooting the video. shoot different location at the same music and edit it whala you have just made the MTV Music Video
I purchased the LJ3390 to replace an existing LJ3320.  The $350 rebate available until the end of Oct was the deciding factor as it made the unit a very reasonable purchase. ---  --- My main interest in the upgrade was to purchase a network connected printer.  Duplex print capability was the other factor that tipped the scale in favour of the LJ3390 over the LJ3052. ---  --- I now have 3 desktop and 2 laptop printers all printing successfully.  All run XP SP2 and are either connected via a wired or wireless network connection.  Software installation went flawlessly. ---  --- While I can't comment about HP versus other vendor software, I can say that the LJ3390 software is a major improvement over that of my LJ3320.  Scanning is faster by at least a factor of 2X, quite likely more like 3-4X.  Printing of complex pages is also much faster, exactly what I would expect from a newer generation print engine and an HP Laserjet printer. ---  --- All in all I am very pleased that I upgraded.  It has met all my upgrade goals.  Printing is faster, scanning is much faster.  The network connectivity ensures anyone can print without another machine being forced to be a print server and constantly left on.  I haven't played with the fax side yet, but am hoping this finally let's me retire my trusty standalone fax machine. --- 
Where else can you get a magazine that talks about whatever it wants? From the perspectives of guys obsessed with computers, technology, and electronics, you get to find out news on just about anything remotely relating to these topics. Political, scientific, hollywood, businesses, technology, I love it. I get to read about topics that are covered in mainstream news sources, and on the next page, what's new with Japanese schoolgirls. I get such a kick out of it. ---  --- I also love the pseudo-geek talk that they caricature. It's kind of stupid that reviews are all "wired" or "tired" but in a funny stupid way.  ---  --- And buried in the enjoyable trash of this magazine are of course, all the many articles about new electronics that I love to keep up with. Like popular science, only not lame. Well, I do like popsci, so I shouldn't make fun of them. --- 
I bought this because a friend had it and it smelled wonderfully of roses.  There must be a quality control problem.  My bottle had no noticible, pleasant sent and therefore did nothing to freshen my hair.  I was only trying to go 1 day without washing.  What a disappointing product and a waste of my money.  :
It is wondeful software.  Simple, easy to use, user-friendly, and very accurate in the pronunciation. ---  --- Buy this CD.  Don't waste your money on the subscription at merriam-webster's website. ---  --- ALso try the Medical dictionary.  It is as equally superb
An extra Lithium battery is ideal for the new i860 camera phone. The desktop charger comes with a second charging slot so you always have a spare battery ready for those last minute low battery alerts.  It saves time and one last thing to worry about. The charge itself is fast too.. --- I have found the 750 mah Lithium Ion Battery to be dependable nomatter at what stage of the remainng battery life you begin recharging.  It doesn't weakin as did my i1000 battery when charging started at mid range.  --- However, the first time you charge or recharge your Lithium battery is the most important charge of all.  You must let the initial or first chatge run out completey before begining to recharge the battery.  The "deader" the battery on it's first run the better the life of the battery and standby time for charges to come. --- Highly recommended
 Having begged a local super market WEGMANS in Buffalo NY suburbs,I found this product in the refrigerated isle w/yogurt and procesed and packaged ready to eat heat and serve items. ---  Texture was not exactley what I expected,but knowing that being a type II diabetic put regular spagetti out of reach (too high in carbs.)I ate the treat with my favorite sauce,then proceeded to put on my shoes and drive directley to the supermarket to purchase another pound of SHIRATAKI Spagetti for my next planned sauce meal. ---  This product is great for me because I eat alone several times a week , it is easy to prepare and is satisfying . ---  I do have a problem with the high cost $1.99 per pound,but I will use this product again just not as often as I would like.
I really enjoy this camera;  mine has the Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar lens.  It works grewat- be sure to use the Memory Stick PRO media.  A great reasonable priced camera
If you have tinted windows this product does not work
Skin was great and was shipped as described.  It really helps protect my Q. I like the texture of the skin,  feels like rubber.  Overall, it's worth buying.  It really protects my Q from scratches
When the scope arrived, it came slightly cracked on the end you look through, which wasn't a good start. Then, when i looked through, there was no magnification, just small red crosshairs. If you are looking for a functioning scope, DO NOT BUY THIS SCOPE. But if ur looking to decorate your gun, then this looks pretty cool on it
The instructions that you do get are wrong.  The items I get and the ones listed are totally different.  It doesn't tell you how to use each of the tools.  Some of the tools I'm still puzzled in what to do with it.  The soft head hammer that is used to knock the pin back into bracelet doesn't look too soft too me! 
pretty raw outlook in the life of Basquiat --- I'm an avid fan so i have no regrets having this
If you crave a gay-themed film full of brooding obsession, gloomy (and very well done) night photography, the occasional graphic sex scene, and METAPHORS so obvious even a high school film class could catch them, then this just might be your cup of tea. Howewver, if you are looking for a film that sustains its running time and subject, then you are out of luck. ---  --- To be fair, Portugese director João Pedro Rodrigues has made some daring choices here. Dialogue is minimal--this might as well be a silent film with sound effects. He's working one of the great themes--the boundary between dream and reality and the dangers of ignoring that boundary. There is the further theme of sexual oppression triggering further oppressions. And yes, there is more than a little boundage mixed in. (This is no 50s MGM musical.) It looks good--night photography, lots of backlight and black surfaces, either dull or glittering. Sergio (played by Ricardo Meneses, a garbageman in Lisbon, drifts further and further into his obsession with a hunky young swimmer (and Sergio is pretty hunky himself). While not obsessing, he drifts from one random sexual encounter to another. Finally, he goes off the beam completely (I won't go into all the details in case you decide to see it). ---  --- The problem is the same that so many self-consciously arty films, from Greed to The Unbearable Lightness of Being, share--their metaphors are too obvious (here, among others, it's human and animal behavior--Sergio's best relationship is with his dog and he lapses into canine behavoir periodically) and they are just too long. O Fantasma would make a pretty good 40 minutes festival film--at 90 minutes, it just drags, particularly the ending with Sergio wandering interminably in a landfill in a rubber bondage suit. (Come to think of it, kind of --- an echo of the equally tedious final sequence of Greed.) I admit it--I really haven't the patience for films that scream out how ARTFUL they are and have little or nothing except style, attitude, and angst. Style and attitude--think Fred Astaire--can be a winning combination. Unfortunately, in spite of lashings of kink and plenty of existential hysteria, this is not a winning film. Basically, it's a bore
The Disney cars shoes were awesome for my grandson.  He loved the racing lights and the wheels on the sides.  They are somewhat tight because of the elestic on the insides, but they were a big hit for him.
Loving the look of the Rolex Daytona, I spotted this watch on Amazon and just had to have one (at the price). --- Arrived in a well padded display box, with all parts of the watch and strap covered in a protective plastic - so no scratches. --- Taking out a few links for that custom fit just took a couple of minutes. --- The watch looks great - better than the images on the Web - and it works as described. --- Other posters that have had issues should read the manual! It does all of the chrono functions, and has full adjustments for hand alignment etc. - Fantastic
The very early years of optical character recognition (OCR) were quite the challenge.  Programs cost thousands of dollars, as did the scanners.  None of them worked very well.  It would take longer to "clean up" the document after scanning than it would for the secretary to have typed it in from scratch.  All of that has of course now changed, and Omnipage 15 Pro takes the art and craft to a new level. ---  --- I have been using the Omnipage product for the last seven years or so.  I use it my law office (along with a number of the other Scansoft, now Nuance, suite of products) on a daily basis, many times through out the day. We use it to chew up everything from court pleadings, to 100 page plus contracts, to real estate property descriptions, which must be accurate down to the comma and semicolon.  Our needs are fairly simple - get the text into the word processor so we can respond on behalf of our client as fast as possible.  ---  --- OP15Pro offers a significant performance increase over its predecessor version 14.  It is faster (very much faster) and more accurate.  Work flow is straight forward.  There is of course the ability to manually set or readjust recognition zones, recognize and format as spreadsheets.  This new version easily handles text in relation to graphic elements and does a good job of keeping them all together in their right places.  Like most everything else, and especially with computers and software, nothing is perfect and there are times that OP15 misses a mark.  It is however, for the most part, very accurate and efficient, but remember, the old rule of "garbage in equals garbage out" still applies.  We have recently started taking pen scanner images of documents in the books at the local registries of deeds.  These are 200 dpi scans of documents that themselves are old photocopies of text placed on paper with IBM Selectrics or worse.  In other words, stuff from the dark ages of the 1970's and before.  We were pleasantly surprised at how well OP15Pro performed. With these very old images there is a need to clean them up, but nowhere near what it used to be. ---  --- I will comment only briefly about the company's tech support.  There has always been enough information provided to get the software up and running. The key, of course, is to read and follow the directions.  A task that is sometimes difficult in this "I want it now world."  ---  --- The one "free call" is not just for installation problems, but can come months or even years after the product is purchased.  I have also found on occasion that tech support will often answer the simple and obvious questions without first asking for the credit card.  Solving technical problems can be frustrating and time consuming.  Considering what the software is attempting to do, there fact that it accomplishes it at all seems at times to be just short of a miracle. Lastly, the company's knowledge base is filled problem solving information.  There is also a tremendously large user base that supports the product through Usenet and other forums. ---  --- Norm Michaels, Esq
After using my iM716s for about 4 months now I have a few things to say about them. ---  --- 1) Price: Lists for $199 on Altec's site.  $70 is a steal. --- 2) Quality: Top notch in the earphones, the clip on the volume module is weak. --- 3) Performance: Bar none best I've had.  These things outperform the huge Logitech ear muff set I use mainly to mow in.  These things allow me to mow the lawn without having to jack up the volume to drown out the mower. --- 4) Conclusion: The only thing that stops me from saying these are perfect is the volume module can be a pain and get in the way.  When moving around, you NEED to have it clipped to something, otherwise it can create inner ear noise.  This can get quite annoying.  I've also caught the cord on things, causing the clip to bend away from the module.  It is removeable and I was able to bend it back.  If there were a pair of equal quality w/o the module, even for the same price, I'd go that route.  With that said, I am in no way regretting my purchase and will recommend these to anyone asking me about them or my 60GB video ipod
I purchased my tv in Dec 2004. I did not purchase the extended warranty. These sets are have all kinds of video problems. Myself and other LCD owners have called for in home service. The service company is QUALXSERV in home service. They want $350.00 to come to your home if you do not have the extended warranty, and can not guarantee a fix. Take it from me buy some other Bran
After waiting months for an order to be filled and then getting screwed by customer service/returns, I decided never to buy from Amazon again.  Go to an electronics or camera store, you'll get better service and the fresh air will do you good
I bought this a few months ago, and after about three or four shaves it stopped working properly. It yanks on the hairs instead of cutting them, which is very painful! It doesn't pull them all the way out, which is even worse because it means you have to go over and over the same spots if your desperate enough to continue.  Sometimes it works okay, but what good is a razor that only works half the time? Others here have noted the short battery life and change in sound when it's losing power. Mine does sound "slower" when it's yanking the hair, but that doesn't seem to be related to battery charge (e.g. it can start the shave in evil hair-pulling mode, and then straighten up and shave right five minutes in!) Even when not pulling hair, the shave is not close. Definitely find a different razor
NYRB features long, in-depth articles about recent books and events.  The "reviews" frequently take the book under discussion as a starting point for a wide-ranging essay which then becomes a work in its own right.  Indeed, I've seen articles in NYRB referred to in academic papers.  Don't fear that NYRB will bore you, however.  I've often found a NYRB article to be a great introduction to an area of thought or literature previously unknown to me. ---  --- The only negative is a rather tedious Michael-Mooreish political stance.  I have no objection to seeing Bush bashed, but wish that NYRB could do so in a more creative and less repetitive manner. Maybe once in a while we could hear from someone who actually likes the man? ---  --- Nevertheless I find NYRB an indispensable periodical.  I find it a great complement to The Economist, which features a more pro-business and pro-free trade economic stance and wider, but less deep, coverage of the world
I understand that software companies strive to give new versions of their products "new" or "better" appearances but in my opinion toos and defaults should be recognizable from version to version as much as possible.  I have used versions of Corel since CorelDraw!3 I just moved to X3 from 10 and find that the trace tool works better but the mechanism is somewhat cryptic.  I would have great sympathy for a buyer that is using it for the first time if they had never used an older version simply because I could only figure it out through past knowledge and trial and error.  The results were great but the methodology lacks some of the intuitiveness of the past versions.  The pallettes are far less comprehensive thn version 10's pallettes.  I truly wish I had version 8's pantone pallette back even though it is incomplete it was so much better layed out.  i will never understand why black has to be at one end of the pallette and white at the other, waste of time...   The tools are all there but they appear different.  I went to work in X3 fright away and found I could work effectively on day one but I did resort to version 10 (which I have kept on my system) a few times in the first week to perform operations that I coupdn't figure out in X3 which were simple in 10.  The Help files are circuitous, apparently never actually getting to the point.  The on line tutorials are great for the absolute novice but useless to anyone who actually has worked with vector art before.  The Export to AI is still a little inaccurate even after all these years.  (You cannot select a line terminus and expect it to be there in AI) The EPS export filter doesn't always want to be readable in Adobe either.  The price is excellent, the product spectacular in its own right and I am happy with my purchase. I expected a little more in this version than I got but no less than I had with additional compatibility.  I still need to have a copy of Illustrator on my machine to deal with people who have only that program
No Support. You have to pay $9.95 to send an email support question. Still cannot print annotations in PDF files that you create. There is a workaround. Nuance should change their name to Nuisance. I hope that someone comes up with an alternative
I brought this after having played Caesar3 and loved it but wanted something with a bit more scope for controlling dynamics of a city - and I thought being a civcity game this would offer me the extension - WRONG - this is a bad rip off of Caesar3, sure, graphics are more advanced with the zoom in view but other than that I was playing the same game but with less involvement or control. This is a sit back and let it happen to you game - keep the people happy and build everything and they'll stay. Caesar IV - that's what you're wanting, it looks like everything this sets itself up to be that it isn't. Feel like I've wasted my money
I bought this Speedo because I like its new strechy fabric and the handsome design. The biggest problem is that the 1-inch wide elastic band can not stay flat on my waist after a few uses. I own several Speedo swimming trunks, this one is the worst. If the band can be improved, I will rank it at least 3 stars. --- 
I bought this for my 4 year old grandson for Christmas.  We opened it up and sat on the floor and began putting it together.  He was excited because he is a Lighting McQueen fan.  He got about four pieces of it together and got very frustrated.  It would not stay together.  THE PUZZLE IS JUNK!!!!!!!!  The pieces are not flat and do not interlock so that they stay together.  He lost interest and left.  I finished it enough so that they were laying together to see the picture - which is very cute.  But, no way would they ever all fit together.  Do not waste your money on this.  I also had to retape the corners of the box, as they were all coming apart too.  Yea for cheap imports.  The USA is so much better off for them???????
The program is great.  Sometimes the GPS is slightly off though.  I'll be travelling on a major highway and all of the sudden it will tell me that I'm off route for no reason.  Not really a big deal, just annoying.  Other than that I recommend it as a cheaper version of a GPS sysytem if you own a laptop
One of the main reasons that I decided to become a GameCube owner was due to its ability to play GBA, GBC, and GB games on an external source, a television, a projector, a 5" universal screen, etc. I could care less about its inability to play DVDs because I had already owned a PlayStation 2 for that. Then afterwards, I started using less for Game Boy titles and more for a game called Super Smash Bros Melee, which most of my former floormates used to play almost all of the time and I would just stand there and watch. ---  --- The system itself is cube-shaped, hence the name GameCube. Like the original Xbox, it comes with four controller sockets and the controller is similar in appearance, but smaller (and no, it is not better than the PS2 controller). Like the PlayStation 2, it uses memory cards to store data. Unique to the GameCube is a handle on the back of the unit, making it easier to carry. Furthermore, it can be purchased in a variety of colors: platinum, black, and purple. Other colors can be imported, though I would recommend finding a store that does paint jobs.  ---  --- I'm giving this an 8.3/10, but that's only because as a North American, I can't help but feel somewhat cheated. For whatever reason, when it comes to video games and their machines, the US dwellers are always deprived of really neat things, like Panasonic Qs (GameCubes with built-in DVD players), GameCube/Game Boy player bundle deals, PlayStation Xs, NES Axe Colors, Tri-star adapters, Game Boy hunters, the availability of systems in multiple colors, etc. Interestingly enough, I've found this problem to be prevalent with mostly the Nintendo and Sony systems. (Whoever said life isn't fair sure wasn't joking.) If the Panasonic Q had ever been released in the US and if this system had at lest been available in more colors here (without having to import - an unnecessarily tedious, complicated and excessively costly procedure, by the way), then this probably could have gotten something closer to the 5-star range, but with all due respect, one would think that Nintendo would start showing a little more consideration and respect for us Americans than that. ---  --- The KAB score: 8.3 super.
My son received this figure for his birthday - it broke within the first 5 minutes.  The sign on his chest lights up, which is cool - but now he has no legs, so he certainly can't run
even if you are not, buy this watch.  I am a nurse, much like many of the other reviewers.  In fact, I bought it due to their reviews.  It is a fantastic watch.  Easy to read, has an illumination option and a handy date feature.  The only trouble I have is the size of the band (too long).  I will take it to a jeweler to take a few links out, however, the directions for doing this yourself make it looks easy (it's not).  Don't even bother looking for another watch, this one is a steal
They run MUCH smaller than Birkenstocks. I sent the size 44 back (which is comfy in the comparable model in Birkenstocks; is it the Boston?) and got the 45 and it STILL feels small. The upper is ok, the shoe isn't the best made thing but is adequate; it's just the size thing that bothered me
I love the taste of these little Chocolates. I find that I need to have one 1 hour before eating - less and they don't work. If I have  two in one day (late morning, mid-afternoon) the effect is cumalative. I can eat a very light dinner and be completely satisfied
This is the best! I love it and use it to roll out the muscles in my tight calves. Its made me a better runner. My husband loves when I take it to his tight shoulders... I can massage him so much longer than I could before. This is a great purchase
IF you have any interest in design, i recommend getting this mag, it has the latest trends in design as well as new products and designers
I received this for my 3 yr old daughter and she absolutely loves it.  The price is great right now, especially with free shipping. --- She loves to dress the doll and use all the accessories.  More than worth the low price...I'm going to stock up on a few more for misc. gifts.  The package is large and comes with a lot of accessories
my sister have been uesing it since i bought it for her and i think she like it 
Be forewarned those who may be driving in the desert at night on some dark, deserted piece of highway. Stop for hitchhikers at your own risk. Also avoid the urge of trying to be too helpful to fellow motorist stranded along the way. Remember things are not always what they appear to be. ---   --- This was quite a well-constructed, coherent storyline from beginning to end. You are never left in the dark with this plot. Everything is explained at the appropriate time, the history of this particular vampire sect, how they happened to show up in Midwest America, how the vampire virius works in the body, its telepathic properties and what must be done to cure yourself from the curse of "The Forsaken." All this infomation was nicely worked into the script in such a way as not to bog down the viewer with too much substance, hence detracting from what the average movie fan is looking for, gore and violence. ---  --- A brief comment for any young girls who may get struck watching this with a boyfriend. While you may not enjoy the horror elements in the movie you might enjoy the male members of the cast which includes; Brendan Fehr (Roswell), Kerr Smith (Dawson's Creek, Final Destination) and Johnathon Schaech (That Thing You Do) as the head vampire. ---  --- Brendan Fehr was terrific as the young, wise beyond his years vampire hunter roaming the highways and byways in search of the vampire that infected him with the virius. My favorite scene in the movie is when Nick (Brendan Fehr) and Sean (Kerr Smith) stop at a roadside diner for a bite to eat. A two-way conversation quickly turns into a monologue when Nick begins to compare the aspirations and hopes of his generation with those of the last. It's not only hilarious, but absolutely true. Without giving away too much of the ending, I'll just say a perfect opening was provided for a sequel. While I'm not generally a fan of sequels, I would've liked to see Brendan Fehr reprise his role of vampire hunter at least one more time. ---  --- Simply the most enjoyable vampire film since "The Lost Boys."
We've only used the mic (and another that is identical) about 10 times now, but no complaints so far.  My experience with Logitech products has been good in the past and I expect no different this time.  We use it for the Karaoke Revolution games for the PS2. ---  --- It would be nice if there was a gain adjustment right on the mic, but that may be a limitation of the PS2 or the game, so I can't hold that against the mic without knowing more. ---  --- The cord is pretty long, I'd say 12' or so.  Whether or not it works on a PC or if a PC-USB mic works on a PS2, I don't know.   --- Since I don't have any complaints, you might wonder why I gave it 4 stars and not 5.  To me, 4 stars means "It does the job and has no major flaws".  5 stars means "This thing is awesome!
These cheddar bunnies are now a favorite in our house.  Better tasting and cuter than goldfish crackers, these are a good snack to give to your kids, or eat yourself.  I was very pleased with this purchase
I have tried all four Fox River Rice flavors and this is my favorite.  While cooking the rice, the aroma of the seasoning filled my kitchen!  This flavor also has a little bite from the pepper.  I have served it with chicken and steak!  Great product
I had to return this phone twice to Motorola for keys that weren't working.  It was too frustrating. ---  --- Can't use the phone in my house or at work although my prior Nokia worked well.  ---  --- There are some nice things -- but these are externals and certainly not explained in the user manual. --- --customisation of the front screen is do-able. --- --there's a composer in the phone to compose your own ringtone.  No mention in the user manual.  Stumbled across it. --- --Ringtones are expensive to buy from Cingular.  First you pay for the ringtone and then you pay for the access to the internet to download it.  A double payment.  The saving grace was the ability to send the ringtones to myself by searching for methods on the internet.   --- --The volume was always frustrating.  I was unable to find a ringtone loud enough so that i could hear the phone when it's in my purse.  Volume controls are easy.  However putting the phone on vibrate was buried in the menus and not in the user manual.  Counterbalanced by the ability to put an icon on the front screen so i could easily change it to vibrate.   --- -- I especially hate how loud the phone is when you go to turn it off in a theater.  You're being responsible and the phone does that annoying Moto noise.  It's only silent when you shut it down from silent ringing.  Yet to set it on silent ringing using the side buttons, you get noisy tones as you lower the volume
I am trying the Perricone Promise diet. --- I received this item in a timely manner and well packaged
It is a quick meal when you need it, but hopefully you won't need it too often.  I guess you can't expect too much from a two-minute meal, but it would be nice if you could expect more than this.  It is an easy kosher meal when you don't have a kosher microwave
I discovered Seal the same way that most people did: through his utterly beautiful song "Kiss From A Rose".  I heard it on the radio one day, and played it constantly for months after that until I finally decided to purchase the album the song was from.  As it happens, the song is from Seal's most revered album, his multi-platinum 1994 self-titled album.  (This is not to be confused with his other self-titled album, his debut, released in 1991.)  I didn't know what to expect when I bought the album, having heard only one song from it, but months after purchasing it I'm glad I made the gamble. ---  --- I think that the sub-genre which best classifies SEAL is urban.  Urban music, according to All Music Guide, is smooth and polished, often romantic, sometimes uptempo and funky, and features soulful vocals.  SEAL has all of this and more.  It has techno beats, but they're not as overwhelming as one might expect.  They blend together with peaceful, occasionally ethereal guitars and Seal's incredibly soothing singing.  This is, no doubt, stylish music, but first and foremost it's a collection of warm, encouraging songs penned by a very talented musician.  There's nothing that comes close to being a bad song here; there's not even a slightly weak composition.  Thus it's a little harder to pick highlights than usual.  Some highlights include the strong opening track, "Bring It On"; the emotional hit "Prayer For The Dying"; the shimmering "Dreaming In Metaphors"; the upbeat "Newborn Friend"; and, needless to say, the absolutely wonderful "Kiss From A Rose".  The closing track, "Bring It On (Reprise)" is another beautiful song, but "Kiss From A Rose" is possibly the most lovely song I've ever heard.  Listening to it in the warmth of one's home during a snowy December afternoon is an incredibly powerful experience. ---  --- The message of the album, if there is one, is "Keep on going - life is beautiful!"  It could fail under any other popular artist, but Seal succeeds marvelously.  This is some of the most heartfelt, inspirational singing I've ever heard.  There's a delightful optimism in Seal's singing that sounds strong rather than naiive.  It's hard to feel down after listening to such an uplifting album as this.  Seal is certainly one of the most talented musicians of R&B (or rock - you decide).  These songs have clear, strong messages, warm, inspirational lyrics, heartfelt, soothing singing, danceable beats, and a whole lot of emotion. ---  --- Once you've heard "Kiss From A Rose", I guarantee you'll want to pick up the album.  If you're already thinking of doing so, then I encourage you to go forward and buy it; you won't regret it.  It's become one of my favorite albums.  When you're feeling disillusioned or depressed with the state of your life or just life in general, look no further than SEAL to make you cherish it once again.
This shaver only works on short or fine hair. If your hair is long (more than 1/4 inch) or coarse, it just skips over the hair and doesn't do anything. I've thrown it away and gone back to disposable razors
This solved my problem of ants in the feeder... had it hanging on our deck all summer long, and they never got to it!  This feeder is also very easy to clean, and because it is made of glass does not pick of that aging, hazy appearance.  I highly recommend it to anyone
I have been struggling with dry skin and mild acne for years. Recently, I revamped my cleansing routine and my makeup. I bought the Philosphy Purity cleanser and Hope in a Jar. It has made an unbelievable difference in my skin! My skin is smooth, not a dry flake anywhere. It is as soft as a baby's butt. ---  --- It is worth noting that a little goes a LONG way. You only need a very small amount (about the size of a dime or less) for your whole face. It is a very light texture, almost like a mousse, and glides over your skin and absorbs quickly. If you use too much (I did the first few times)then your face could look greasy. If you remember that less is more, then you will get a perfectly moisturized, yet matte, complexion. ---  --- After using the Philosophy cleanser and Hope in a Jar, I use the Bare Escentuals mineral makeup (bought the Light/Fairly Light starter kit). My skin, for the first time ever, is flawless. No acne. No dry skin. No reddish areas. Just a perfectly smooth complexion. I keep looking in the mirror, thinking "Is this my skin? Really?" I cannot believe what a difference this product (and the mineral makeup) has made.  ---  --- I have heard of others being allergic to some ingredients in the Hope in a Jar, so it is not for everyone. I suggest getting a sample size to make sure you won't have a reaction
I got this shirt when it was on sale for $10 so I snatched it up quickly. I like the shirt a lot. It is very pretty on. Order the size that you normally wear. I made the mistake of ordering a large instead of a Medium. The shirt is way to big. So maybe even order a size smaller because it is just a bigger shirt.
jewish soles trying to avoid the devil's brigade (hitler's killing machine).... sad, but oh so funny and cute in sections that alas, maybe only the jewish people would truly understand. i found it all of these things but with love, warmth to the end
I purchased these slippers in pink, and not only are they super cute, they are quite comfortable and very warm.  The sole of the slipper is slightly heavier than most, but it is nice if you need to step outside or in the garage for something when it's cold out. I would recommend them. :
My car was broken into several months ago, so I decided to buy the wrap. It has worked so well; it is better than other steering wheel binders since it has an alarm on it.  --- Much cheaper than other conventional car alarms. A little bulky but it does the job. I really think thieves think twice when they see the huge thig on the steering wheel and the lights for the alarm. I am really glad I got this product here at amazon.co
I can't believe that with technology as advanced as it is, Samsung could produce this giant POS. It's flashy, yes. But does it deliver?? No. I actually refused to pay the bill and let them shut my service off. I loved the clarity of the pictures, even though the 1 megapixel camera was pretty lousy, and I even liked the video feature. But the phone is only good IF YOU CAN USE IT!!! It's been years since I've had such lousy reception from a phone. I'm considering taking the dealer to court over this, since they pushed it on me and told me what a great phone it was. I want my money back!!
Very quick delivery.  Price was very good compared to other online companies.  Will use again
Mr. Hayek apparently despises free thought.  Furthermore, his ignorance of libertarian philosophy is clear; discounting his opinion is appropriate.  I'm guessing he is a Republicrat and finds the socialist ideas found in the corrupt two party system satisfying.  Funny considering his namesake, Frederich Hayek, is one of the greatest libertarian thinkers of all time and one of my personal heros.   ---  --- But, I digress:  Reason magazine has been in my mailbox every month for well over 20 years and I would buy a lifetime subscription if I could.  Not every issue is a five star issue, but on the whole Reason is the most interesting periodical on the market.  That said, Reason has dropped a notch in quality ever since the brilliant Virginia Postrel left the editor's post several years ago.  She is a true intellectual and kept Reason at a consistently high level.  I still love to read my issue every month and while I don't always agree with the positions I am always stimulated
Granted, I saw this movie at about three in the morning at a party, but I think I had enough sense in me to realize how truly horrible it was. It's so... bad. It has some seriously subpar performances from pretty much all involved, and the script was just awful. Gosh, it's hard to believe I actually sat through it. It was just so... exactly what it was, I guess. A stupid sex comedy that's absolutely terrified to be anything else. The thing that really pushed this above the radar for me to blip at was the truly offensive tone of some of the material. I think my real downfall here was the fact that I'm a gay guy whose friends are mostly straight guys. The scenes regarding a certain character and his chance encounter with homosexuality are so repugnant it's almost ridiculous. Now, I'm not one to get offended easily, but this just took it a bit too far. Just the attitudes and behaviors expressed by most of the characters just made me depressed, which isn't really something I look for in a movie. It just seems to me that if 'gay' had been replaced with 'black', this would have been deemed racist and probably wouldn't ever have been released. Not that I'm condoning censorship, but when your tone becomes so... mocking, I guess. Oh well, I guess all I'm trying to say is I will definitely not be repeat viewing this film, and I don't recommend you view it at all if you're a woman, or gay, or you care about others
I love it; I am a 55-year old woman in pretty good shape and I was able to get it out of the box and assembled completely by myself. It arrived very very quickly.  My only complaint is that the bottle of "touch-up" for the aluminum finish, which came with it, was not securely closed, and leaked out, so that when I opened the box, I could smell the strong odor of solvent everywhere, and the bottle was empty
I bought this game on the fly cause the cover illustration looked so interesting that I couldn't resist. The instructions were a little confusing to understand at first, but once gameplay started it was picked up pretty easy and much fun was enjoyed by everyone. The game is geared for those ages 10 and up, but it was so easy to understand and so much fun, that my 8 year old neice was able to play without teaming up with an adult. The game promotes math skills which is a HUGE plus since many games today are only about fun. This game has it all, fun, education and the artwork on the cards is fantastic. When we played, we threw in chocolate gold pieces so we'd have real pirate plunder and everyone had to speak like a pirate. It's a really great way to spend quality time with your family and it's fun for all ages
When I read Alpha Male Syndrome, I saw myself and the many "Alphas" I've worked with in high-tech corporate America.  In some instances I could call out the names of those I'd either worked with or had family relationships or friendships with - based on the Alpha types, strengths and risk behaviors so well defined in this book.   I found the practical tips - encouraging specific change, in those who don't seem open to changing - to be useful, hopeful, encouraging and sometimes even funny.  I may go broke sending Alpha Male Syndrome to my too-many Alpha friends and more importantly to those who work or live with them! ---  --- From soup to nuts I enjoyed recognizing and knowing myself better through the book and from taking the author's online Alpha Assessment - then following the Action Steps in the book, and updated online Alpha Tips.  I can see how and why Ms. Ludeman and Dr. Erlandson's approach to executive coaching is effective.  
I purchased this kit, primarily for the extra battery, which retails for about what I paid for this item.  Having the backup battery is great, but I was pleasantly suprised by the soft case.  It protects my DSC-P200, without being bulky or heavy.  With the camera being so small, it was hard to find good protection without spending quite a bit of money.  The case for the memory sticks is nice as well.  It is easy to lose a stick if it's just floating around and the case keeps them securely.  All in all, this is an excellent value
As other reviewers have stated, Ludlum passed away at the time of the publication of this novel. Unfortunately, we may never know what other voice has been mingled with Ludlum's to complete this tale. Honestly speaking, I believe this to be the case because the story is actually better than I have come to expect from Ludlum. No disrespect intended, but I feel this work is actually above his standard. ---  --- There is certainly a few moments of unbelievable plotting and characterization, but who cares when the ride is such a rip. At first you think you're reading a typical espionage thriller and eventually come to realize it's more than that, much more. For New World Order conspiracy fans you're in for a treat. Ludlum et al's take on an old plot is so fresh and intrigueing you are left speechless. I'll just say this, if you have ever wondered if the Nazi's survived WWII you will REALLY wonder after reading The Sigma Protocol. God help us if there's any truth to this plot
I agree with the reviewer who likened it to actual lemon juice.  It is very strong, and I realized after spraying it twice it only needed once... most likely because it is an eau de parfum and not eau de toilette.  Very much worth the money.  I was complimented on it the entire day. It does not resemble lemon Pledge to me at all
This pedometer is so much cheaper (~$7) than the typical decent ones (that go for about $18 - $20).. now I know it is for a reason.. the buttons are flimsy, the package looks very cheap, the one I bought and presented to a senior citizen - did not work, also found that the Sr Citizen found it very hard to use the buttons on this little device.. terrible ergonomics/form factor. ---  --- Would recommend spending a bit more and getting the Omron/Oregon Sc  $18 pedometers - much better form factor, high reliability and quality
This was the first Disney movie I watched as a child. ---  --- I would still watch it today.  Disney successfully humanizes the movie to children by using "friendly" animals, while still keeping the main storylines intact. ---  --- Thumbs up to the music; "Love Goes On and On" is a moving piece, and even hits my hard heart.   ---  --- Parents with younger children be warned: Some scenes may frighten them. --- 
These are just as good as I hoped. No self assembly required & very comfortable. Recommended
I became a Robson Green fan when I saw the first season of Wire in the Blood.  Since then, I have read the books, and watched Green in his other crime series, Touching Evil.  If you like to watch films about police solving serial killer crimes, you will enjoy this.  The crimes are shocking, the denouement is interesting, and at the heart of the story is the developing relationship between Dr. Tony Hill (Green) and the police woman with whom he works these crimes
I have sensitive skin and this product burned my skin, leaving burn marks for weeks! Finally, I went to the dermatologist who had to prescribe something to help the skin heal. Please, check with your doctor FIRST before trying this
My naturally curly hair is thinning and I thought this conditioner would be helpful. The conditioner did not handle the tangles in my hair nor did it make it feel conditioned. I thought it was too drippy. I nearly used half a bottle by pouring it into my hand. I would not recommend this conditioner
This is not a good Tornado disaster movie by any stretch of the imagination. The worse thing about the film is the horrible, unconvincing special-effects! The scene where the family in the car trying to outrun the tornado in the town and the mom shrieking "It's coming closer!" is badly done and also Dan starting to fly out the window and his dad attaining super-human strength pulling him back into the vehicle is incredibly stupid and not dramatic in the slightest. I know, however, a guy named Mike and 2 robots who would probably have to endure this terrible B-grade movie (Actually F-grade) If you want a good, entertaining tornado movie that doesn't include bad acting, bad "Special" FX, bad script and dumb actors check out "Twister&quot
Pefect addition to any little mermaid collection. Very durable plastic, not too many little pieces. Clothes for dolls could be easier to take on/off
All the positive comments you read here about this film are true.  ---  --- This classic western stars John Wayne, Pedro Armendariz and Harry Carey Jr, along with a great supporting cast lead by Ward Bond -- the usual John Ford suspects. Ford strikes a balance between action and sentimentality, directing this simple story in a straightforward fashion with a great sense of style. This is Ford's first color film and cinematography by Winton C. Hoch looks really, really rich and with enough sand to make you wish you had some lemonade.  ---  --- Duke really shines in this film -- just watch those expressions. ---  --- Restored to its original pristine 1948 35mm real Technicolor glory, "3 Godfathers" is a natural for the Christmas season. This heartwarming drama is a gritty, tender, timeless classic. A film the whole family can watch. ---  --- This sleeper film in the WB/MGM catalog was way, W A Y overdue on DVD in the US. But here it is, most welcomed and highly recommended! ---  --- (I've revised my original 2003 review to reflect this title's availability on DVD. Released with zero fanfare, I was first aware of its release when I saw a newspaper ad for it one week before Christmas 2005.
GD USA is a monthly magazine targeted at, and available free to, professionals within the graphic design community.  It consists overwhelmingly of promotional material - advertising, company profiles, personal profiles, and so on.  If you are not in the business, you will find little of interest here.  If you ARE in the business, you can get the magazine free from their website
Big disappointment. Cheaply made. T-rex model does not snap together, can not even fit together as parts are improperly molded.  Microscope less functional than a magnifying lens.  Volcano is ok, the plaster does work, but you must provide ingredients for the eruption.  Weather center very very flimsy and breaks.  I was quite surprised a name like Smithsonian would be associated with this low of quality in a product.  Supplies for crystals subpar for what is required.  Was an enormous disapointment after the holidays for my sons. 
 I bought this and the original pen in purple.  I couldn't tell the difference except the price.  Certanly good for athritic thumbs. --- As a writer, I will never use any other.  It is getting quite a bit of attention in my writing class
I usually love the Philosophy brand bath and shower gels, but this was a major disappointment-didn't smell anything like pound cake or lavender for that matter-in fact the odor is quite strong and nauseating. There are other gels that are great but AVOID this one! Phew!!
A terrific documentary.  Even if you have seen it on PBS, you need the dvd to view the great extra material
I wanted to use this product to tape sporting events, as part of a promotions unit I belong to. I had used Videowave 7 which was OK and produced a more than adequate product, but would on occassion crash to the extent I would have to reload the software. I thought I would give PE 3.0 ago, since Adobe products generally have a good reputation.  ---  --- Well, it goes to show that you can't just rely on reputation. The program lets me down horribly when capturing the video from the camera. THe camera records DVD video (VOB files) straight to DVD. When I capture these files into the PE program, all moving images within the video become pixelated with lost resolution to the point of being useless. I have tried various other ways of capturing but always the same result. There is nothing to be done from that point...for me this program falls on the first hurdle!! It is unbelievable to me that a professionally released image processing algorithm could corrupt video so badly, and frustrating that I actually paid money for it...a first year undergraduate could have provided a better effort.  ---  --- I have subsequently gone through the motions to produce a video, and to be honest he layout of the settings, ease of applicaiton of various functions is quite good and better than Videowave 7 IMHO. I was able to produce quite nice edited products with intro, text and audio overlays very quickly. Still this isn't much use when the video itself had already been digitally butchered. ---  --- If you are videoing things that don't move you may well like this product. If you are videoing dynamic scenes, give it a miss. Big disappointment
I agree with the other reviewer that this is more like a shape sorter than a kitchen. My daughter loved it when she was 1. Now she's turned 2 and she's lost interest in it, like many other "baby toys". I had to get her a larger and more realistic toy kitchen so she can "cook" with it
These are the most comfortable boots I've ever had straight out of the box.  They look good and feel even better.  Highly recommended!!!
Outstanding full-flavored Earl Grey tea. Better than the other non-branded Earl Grey teas
won't ship to hawaii. hawaii is a state in the united states.  --- some seem to think it is a forign country. damn fools!
I just got this myself and it works like a charm.  Installation took atbout 1/2 hour and it works just like it advertises. ---  --- I couple of things.  I agree with the need to place the solar cell within a couple of inches of the garage door light.  I have a sears craftsman with a flourescent bulb which is enough with the solar cell right above the light.  There is a pressure stick pad that holds the solar cell onto the garage door opener.  There is a black 3-4 foot wire (looks like an RCA audio wire and plug) that connects the solar cell to the laser beam generator which is maybe about 3/4" long and about 3/8s of the inch wide.  It too has a stick adhesive to be glued onto your garage ceiling.  The laser pivots easily so it can be aimed. ---  --- The actual beam emits a pulsing red dot not bigger than 1/8" wide onto your dashboard when you drive under it.  It takes a little getting used to a first to know what to look for when you're parking.  My garage ceiling is about 2 feet above the roof of the car so it's pretty close to the laser generator.  If you have a higher ceiling, the mounting is probably harder but the dot is maybe slightly bigger.  The one thing that I have to adjust is that my wife is shorter than me so she sees the beam alittle later than I do and has to sit up a bit in the seat to see it on the dashboard of our Toyota Sienna which is a little flat.  I need to re-aim the laser to an easier to spot point for her since this is her parking slot.   ---  --- Works like a charm - just wish the dot was little bigger to make it easier to spot when you pull in.  Great feature not to have any batteries or plug ins required
This item was easy to find, purchase and use. Saved us several dollars as well. A true win-win. Thanks
I'm a huge fan of the Pria line, but these are not like the others - they are heavier and a little grainy.  I don't hate them, but will not buy them again.  The flavor is pretty good though, just not what I was expecting.  I highly recommend the Pria 110 calorie line - the vanilla is my favorite but the peanut butter and others are close behind. --- Thank
I never really knew of Matthew Modine until I saw this movie.  He was very good in the part and I have watched the movie several times. I also purchased the book as well.   
This seems like a really sturdy, lightweight stroller. I just wanted something simple and strong that can get us out of the house quickly--we live in a very hilly, sort of rustic area, so I needed something I could take my son to the park in without hauling out the big buggy. This is really light, and it folds and has a carrying strap in case the boy wants to walk a bit. (There is also a storage bag for travel.) ---   --- The tires have treads on them, so they can handle steep terrain, and they give a pretty smooth ride over bumps. The fabric is sort of a thick canvas-sy polyester--not removable, but it seems like it could easily be scrubbed/hosed clean if necessary. The seat also has some padding and back support (although, on the con side, it's probably not the coolest compared to mesh). The weight limit is given as 37 lbs, so my 19-month old still has plenty of room to grow--his shoulders are comfortable and his feet don't reach the footrest yet (he is 27 pounds and about 33 inches tall). On the plus side, it seems bigger than the Wrangler All-Weather umbrella stroller, plus it reclines a bit (you unzip/unbutton the sides to allow the fabric to unfold), unlike the Volo.  ---  --- The square canopy is maybe not the greatest (it only covers the face, and could actually sit a little higher I think)--but as for everyone complaining that it falls off, I have found that when you flip the canopy to the back, if you then detach the back flap from the seat, you can  attach the side flaps to that velcro on the back to keep it from sliding off.  ---  --- Some people have also mentioned kicking the wheels, but I'm 5'6" and haven't had any problems--I think it's a matter of not standing right on top of the thing since it's an umbrella stroller and doesn't have a superwide wheelbase.  ---  --- I would give it 4.5 stars I think, but am giving 5 because of the great price! I'm pretty happy with this--and my son is constantly trying to climb in, so he must like it too... I figure that with the money we saved, we can buy a nice Kettrike or some other form of transportation the boy can grow into.
I Bought this product almost a month ago, its sleek, its reliable and has all good features a good Digital Camera should. ---  --- Worth the money for a Sony Camera, this camera has the usualy Seen High Quality for a SONY product
Don't be fooled by the similar-sounding, inarticulate reviews--this product is not what you think it is. It contains neither motor nor electrical stimulation. The "energy fields" described have nothing to do with actual energy/electricity--they might as well use the word "aura" for all of the logical sense it makes.  ---  --- In the words of a company representative: ---  --- The Tingler is not battery operated there is no button. That would be our Sqwiggler which has 2 AA batteries located in the handle.  You're welcome to return the Tingler for a Sqwiggler.  The Sqwiggler is $29.95 Please call 800-978-8765 and we can get your credit card information and charge the amount difference of $9.95 plus $8.45 for the shipping fees.  ---  --- Make your own judgement, but don't expect to be as wowed or thrilled as the company claims you'll be
I've been using this phone with the Net10 service since March, and have to say I am very happy with it.  Coverage areas have been great. --- I don't use a cell phone very often, so this was the most economical way for me to go. Although the phone doesn't have all the bells and whistles like other phones have....it gets the job done
We received one of these with our new Skeeter Beater. --- I didn't know why there were no gnats, or mosquitos, buzzing around my head, and in my face, as there always are... yet,  no bugs were in the tray of this large Skeeter machine. I thought that it was repelling, instead of killing the gnats and mosquitos.   --- Well, after a couple of days, my husband remembered that we received this little gizmo, and he had forgotten that he turned it on and left it running in the screen house. --- This little thing was apparantly repelling the bugs away from the large skeeter unit!  It was sitting approximately 15' away. --- Those gnats flying in your face and eyes, constantly, can drive you mad, and they were there all day, every day...what a nightmare!  Now, even in the evening, no mosquitos!  What the heck is in this thing?  It works without dangerous chemicals???? --- This is absolutely the best repeller I have ever used, and I have tried them all.  We live in a large wooded area, surrounded by ponds, lakes, and swamps.  We are amazed at this item, and will be buying more.  Psyche!!!  NO BUGS!!! 
I recommend this magazine to really learn techniques to improve your running level.  There is not alot of filler in this small magazine.  I find that this is the magazine I don't circulate with friends because I like to keep the articles for future reference.  I learn something new each time
Within two hours of recieving my complaint the seller refunded my money, without requriing that I ship the product back.  For that I am thankful and appreciative, and can recommend the seller. I have no idea what was up with the product. ---  --- As I noted earlier, I just recieved this product and it has the overwhelming smell of petroleum, literally like the smell that comes from an oil truck delivering fuel oil to your home.  I bought this for a child and would never dream of giving it to them.  I am contacting the seller to request a refund.  If I succeed I will note that in the review and increase the star rating
The gripmaster has helped me strengthen my left fingers which is so important in the use of my reins when riding.  I took it with me on vacation to Florida, and two of my friends--one older who wanted to use it for arthritic hands and the other just for stiff joints--saw it, started using it and loved it.  So I ordered two more! --- 
First of all, this is NOT the worst movie ever made, nor even the worst movie ever made that was given a budget and some name stars. The worst movie ever made was "Autumn in New York", but that is a different review.  ---  --- No, this not a great movie, but it is very interesting. And for once, thank God, it doesn't end with everything tied up in a pretty Hollywood bow where everthing works out for everyone. It has a gritty sort of realism that transcends the walk through performances of the stars of the movie. And the scenery works well for the overall feel of the movie, bleak. ---  --- More interestingly for me and others of my generation who grew up with the brat pack, this marked the end of these actors forays into trying to do the teenager thing. For Molly Ringwald, she didn't do anything of note again until "The Stand" six years later, and for Andrew McCarthy, well it could be argued that he still hasn't starred in anything of note again (although he probably made some money from "Weekend at Bernies" I & II). ---  --- Anyway, probably better to rent than buy, I am only buying it to complete my 80's collection.  ---  --- 
This is a highly entertaining film with an incredibly minimalist screenplay that succeeds beyond all expectations. This film's strengths are its characters and the actors that portray them. Sean Connery plays Captain Marko Ramius with great bravado and charisma relying greatly on his mesmerizing screen presence to maneuver the entire direction of this film. Tim Curry is amusing as the dutiful Dr. Petrov in a role well suited for him. The rest of the cast balances out the histrionics of Sean Connery and Tim Curry with realistic and convincing performances to bring authenticity and realism to the drama of this film. Alec Baldwin as Jack Ryan, James Earl Jones as Admiral James Greer, Sam Neill as Captain Vasily Borodin, Scott Glenn as Commander Bart Mancuso, Richard Jordan as Dr. Jeffrey Pelt and an impressive Peter Firth as Political Officer Ivan Putin bring a needed sense of pragmatism to their collective roles to bolster the dramatics and emotion of the story. This was probably one of Alec Baldwin's best performances and he truly conducts himself in the manner that the character of Jack Ryan should have been portrayed. Baldwin perfectly conveyed the analytical mind that the character of Jack Ryan embodied. Sam Neill is also brilliant as the dedicated officer who also possesses a very human side that perhaps puts him in conflict with carrying out his duties to the full extent of his country's political dictates and ambitions. Sam Neill has a wonderful role in this regard and he plays it flawlessly. I liked Scott Glenn's character immensely as the US Commander who truly has to rely on his instincts and his logical interpretation of facts and events to face what is put before him. The list of performances goes on but the point is that portrayal of these characters and how they think and conduct themselves is at the heart of this film. Their efforts make this film a great political, action-adventure and emotional drama. 
Santa brought this item.  We opened it several days later and it broke the same day. 
I can't believe how well made this set is. I have been looking for good quality kitchen toys for my daughter for Christmas. I wanted something sturdy and not plastic. I just received my order today and these items are great! My son opened the box and tested them for his little sister and he can't wait to play with them with her.  --- I ordered this set and the baking set and both are made out of solid wood and are extremely durable. I am very impressed and wish amazon carried the matching coffee pot and blender! ---  --- I also had a problem with the velcro on the butter.  It was an easy fix with some super glue.  I think the heat during the shipping made the velcro come off
I have been an extremely devoted SMB fan since the very first time I laid eyes on it. I own ALL of them, and so when I stood in line all night Saturday (and through Sunday morning, 8am), I made sure to grab myself a copy of SMB: Banana Blitz for my brand new Wii. I bought an entire set of controllers, anticipating the mini-game fun with all my friends. (We're huge SMB fans, all of us. It always makes an appearance at our parties.) ---  --- But now I'm really angry. They completely gutted our favorite mini-game(s), hitting Monkey Target worst of all. I can honestly say I don't care that there are 50 freakin mini-games, because now Monkey Target is completely worthless. Instead of the amazingly subtle game play with bonus items, increasingly difficult levels, magnets, velcro, double bonuses, wind speed and direction, and the all-import ramp run-off you have... a cannon, one level, no wind or wind direction, no bonuses, and no special items. ---  --- Who cares if I can SORT of pilot a submarine on a single level? Monkey squash -- no joy there. A lot of the controls for the mini-games are terrible. And so on, so forth. The new mini games suck almost unilaterally, but gosh darn, there are 50 of them! But volume does not make up for lack of quality. ---  --- I love traditional SMB levels and the ones on SMB: Banana Blitz are nice. The graphics are beautiful and fun. But the best part of the game for me and my friends, is now gone and dead. None of the reviews I'd read mentioned the fact that this favorite of most SMB players was killed like this, and if they had, I certainly wouldn't have wasted my $50 plus tax. ---  --- If Sega people are reading this: BRING BACK MONKEY TARGET. That's what people play at parties when they're slightly drunk and sick of listening to Super Smash Brothers, and way too awake to enjoy Mario Party
way to many problems with this version, if you want to replace all your printers, scanners, sound cards and so on, go for it.otherwise stay away
3D Home Architect is a complete crock. I have attempted to use it many times. After hours of reading and playing with it I am still unable to perform the most simple task. I own V1.3 of this software and it outperforms the current version by light years. I also spent lots of time trading emails with Broderbund in an attempt to obtain either additional product support or a refund and I got nothing. So henceforth they will not see another dime of my hard earned $. Sorry
This is a great controller.Especially after all the complaints microsoft had got about its original controller being too bulky(Personally speaking I never really had problems with even that).But since I got Xbox Controller S, I havent touched the big one.This controller gives a better grip,buttons are softer and their positioning is better(the overall feel is quite good).I played rallisport challenge with this controller and beat the whole game. Even in a game like rallisport where precision is required in accelaration and braking to successsfully  master the tracks,I did it without any problems using this controller.Also the vibration feel is very good.So if you are looking to buy an Xbox controller and are not being able to decide which,just go for this smaller one,Controller S without any hesitation.Quality hardware
I received this toy as a gift for my 1-year old son. It was one of the most frustrating toys he's had. The handle requires too much strenght to press down, so he was not able to operate it alone. He could press it down only when standing up (using his body weight), but the size of the spinner made it very inconvinient to play this way: he had to lean and  crouch. The noise that the balls make is rather loud (in my consideration) and can irritate the adults after a while, too. Because my son was already walking, this static toy got very little attention. The positive features: it is made of sturdy plastic and the colors are nice and bright
They are handsome and nicer than I expected, by far.  The fabric has a really nice quality -- strong, pleasantly textured, durable, and a fine rich color.  They're handsome, well-stitched and sturdy, very comfortable, and are holding up to the sun -- some rain too, I must admit.  These were a terrific deal ..
This is a must have if you own the compatable shotgun. But a good tip if you get it would be to dump your bbs into another container and check through them for imperfections. (They will jam the magazine) ---  --- Pros: ---  --- - Very high cap! More than enough for a spring gun! ---  --- Cons: ---  --- - A bit long, and protrudes from the bottom of the gun quite a bit. (But still worth it
In the years I have taken this magazine, I have noted that often covered material becomes tomorrow's news from the latest hot-spot in the world.  So prescient, it is eery - if you have any interest in current events, news or foreign affairs, this journal is a must read.  The contributors are a Who's Who of politics, science and business in the world.  Often the author list will become the under-secretary of state list in the next administration.  For example, the last issue discussed Avian Flu virus.  As a physician, I can tell you that these were excellent informative articles that explained clearly what was happening and what the danger was.  And now this stuff is on TV every day and I can amaze my patients with how much I know about the issue that no one else does.  Reading this will definitely make you look smart.  Try this experiment and see if I'm right.  This article is written in October 2005, days after receiving the October issue with multiple articles about China written by Chinese authors.  Of course that means that these articles aren't really useful for facts so much as they are useful for seeing what China wants us to believe.  I predict that China will be much more in the news in the next 6 to 12 months.  So put this magazine to the test and see. ---  --- One negative is that although the authors are bi-partisan regarding party, they are not "conservative".  You won't ever find pro-tariff, anti illegal immigration, isolationist, anti judicial activism or pro-life articles in here.  Indeed, regardless of which party an author supports, you can pretty much count on expanded government, especially one-world government presented as the solution. ---  --- And lastly, some of the articles are deadly boring and contain stilted, obfuscated, diplomatic jargon.  You will rarely find a simple, eloquent phrase, but you will often find ideas that will pop up in any analysis of the news.  Just realize many of these authors are diplomats and politicians whose careers depend on obfuscation and plausible deniability. ---  --- All in all, this is an extremely influential journal that is full of cutting-edge ideas.  Just realize that many of them may be wrong
I ordered this item thinking that it would be useful when on the road in hotel rooms to light up my work area.  WRONG !!  The light is so DIM, the only thing it might be good for is a night light! This lamp is a good idea, but much too weak to be of any help
I've been subscribing to PLUSA since 1984, the same year I started powerlifting. It contains a wealth of information for the beginner to the elite lifter. Interesting strength articles, interviews with the champions of the sport, results from meets, and the list of upcoming contests. It also contains all the different powerlifting vendors for your equipment needs. Its a must to have this magazine for anyone into or starting out with powerlifting. Its the ORIGINAL mag
I highly recommend this item.  As soon as your little one can sit up on his own, this is a MUST HAVE for all moms.  It fits all shopping carts (except COSTCO, but including TARGET) as well as those icky high chairs available at restaurants.  It keeps baby (and Mommy's hands) from touching the cart handle and prevents the kiddo from wedging his legs in the wrong hole in the cart.  A MUST HAVE! This is the gift I give at baby showers.  I've had for over a year and it has survived many a washing with a touch of bleach.  Still looks good
it is very good luggage carrier to withstand the weather conditions - since i used it in the trip when i started it was raining n not drop of water could enter through it and i was worried since i had all my clothes packed in it. --- it is very convient to install n uninstall with enough capacity to fit your things in it
The Pros: PDA, good mobile phone that really gets out, a camera for all those 'Kodak Moments', all packed in one for a good price --- The Cons: You'll need to get a replacement longer life battery (Seidio makes one), and the browser (Blazer) has MANY problems. ---  --- I'm very happy with the purchase of this smartphone. I've wanted a TREO for a few years but could never justify spending big bucks for one. You can work around the problems with the unit with new battery and browser software, it's a nice little phone. ---  --- I haven't bought a memory card for it, so I can't report on the mp3 capabilities, but I am going in that direction. Somehow I don't think it will replace my iPod, but you never know
Very complete with a lot of things to play for hours. My daughter still plays with it, and she is now four years old. Definitely it was worth it. Highly recommended
Through much prayer and research, I was lead to this book. After reading it I understand the four step approach and can use it in all my educational experiences for my children. I felt so much more comfortable homeschooling my children. I felt I had really been taught how to homeschool!  It is not only informative, but interesting.a rare combination in how to books!
I have subscriptions to a few magazines, and I have to say, SEVENTEEN, is the one I'm always looking forward to. This magazine has a little bit of everything- fashion and make-up tips, how to be healthy (not just stick thin!), tips for school, fun (not very useful, but fun) stuff on guys and love, teen stories, and important information to be aware of. It's fun, but also informing.  ---  --- The models are normal girls, and this mag shows things that not only a size 0 or 2 girl can wear, but also clothing that can be worn by a girl who's size 4, 8, or 16. Many styles from girly to goth are shown, not just one. The clothing and accessories are also affordable, and can be found at stores in your nearby mall.  ---  --- SEVENTEEN isn't all fashion. It's really all about embracing who you are and making the most of life. It's about feeling good about yourself and loving yourself for who you are, and not what you aren't. I've used some of the tips on health, skin care, feeling good, and make-up, and you know what? They do work, and are actually helpful (***gasp***).  ---  --- The celebrity interviews are very good, and such that you can relate to them. The stories about things in teens' lives are also very good- some are sad, but they all make you aware of what really goes on out there. ---  --- It's a wonderful magazine. It doesn't have an overload of ads like Teen Vogue or Elle Girl, while still including fashion (though I will say not as much as these two mags, because these two are almost entirely all how to look good). SEVENTEEN however, has a bit more fashion than Teen People, Teen People having more stories and such (though it is right up there with SEVENTEEN). SEVENTEEN is a happy medium. It's an awesome magazine
I use this for changing the oil in my Mercedes S320.  It performs flawlessly and with minimal effort.  I look forward to using it again. 
The fatigues were just what my son wanted.  The only thing wrong was that there was no inseam available to order.  I guess on fatigues you are suppose to use the drawstring at the bottom.  But my son didn't want that so I had to hem about four inches on each leg.  Other than that it was an excellent product
I got this as a gift from my mother last year.  This product saved my hands and feet!  It helped them stay soft.  No more itchy ankles or knuckles.  I preferred to use this at night, but I do use it on my feet almost everyday before I put my socks on for the day.  It moisturizes without too heavy of a feeling
Although not the model and style requested by my son, my musical background lead me to review and purchase this guitar instead.  It is of fine quality and my son is thrilled by his Christmas gift
I am crazy about Splenda.  I mix equal parts Splenda And Brown sugar for my hot cerael.  It saves money and calories.  Asparteem   ( Nutrasweet)gives me loose bowels.  Splenda meets my sweetner needs without calories
Love it, love it, love it! No more digging through the diaper bag or my purse for dirty, lint covered binkies. It could be a little bigger, for my toddlers binky but they do fit inside and it's a great idea
Everything the negative reviewers say is true and MORE. Please note the following as well: --- 1. If you are a college student taking a class online that uses Blackboard software, Vista will prevent you from posting to the class discussion board and answering any fill-in-the-blank or discussion questions on TESTS! To fix this download the FoxFire browser (free) and use it to access your course. Because Vista uses so much memory and is already so huge, they had to drop quite a few little programs that software needs to access in the Operating system. ---  --- 2. HUGE MEMORY AND HARD DRIVE DRAIN.  --- Look at this comparison --- Windows XP Professional    Size on drive 1.5 gig    Memory requirements 128 MB ---  --- Windows Vista    Needs 15 GIG To Load. Does not say how large the program is but I wouldn't think its small!!! Memory requirements 1 GIG! ---  --- If you check the DELL website you will see that they recommend that you have 2 gig of memory to use Windows Vista. That is a few $$$ worth of memory just to run the operating system while openning a program. Try running a game or doing animation with that kind of a sink hole in your system! The less memory you have available, the slower everything, including websites will load (no matter how fast your internet connection)  ---  ---  What is worse is that to fix what is wrong with it (ie replace all those small programs your software expects to find in the operating system), they will have to ADD patches that can only make it bigger and hungrier for memory! ---  --- This is the most pathetic excuse for an upgrade that I have ever seen. I would expect some lawsuits before this is over! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT
Muffet vs Spider! This is one cool looking figure and since the accessory spider is as big as Muffet makes it a kick butt scene. Again the turn is to the S&M pink & black leather bondage look, similar to the spiked outfit of Red Riding Hood. This is certainly not the image your mind conjures up to the nursery rhyme but it's a great display piece. The downfall from five stars is that when setup, Muffet is almost obscured by the spider. Both pieces look great in detail but a slightly different pose may have improved the figures
Beautiful, stunning absolutely gorgeous. ---  --- A quick note to fellow Brits, this was ordered on October 22nd and arrived on November 1st and is much cheaper here than on amazon.co.uk or anywhere else in the UK!! I've ordered stuff domestically that has taken longer in the post!!
The cable is exactly what I needed, and was much more inexpensive than other alternatives. Drivers provided on the accompanying CD worked but were not as complete as I would have liked. I am still very satisfied, as it was only the cable that I was really after, especially for the price at which I bought it
OEM charger failed. Replaced with this one -- it's more compact & functions well
I was looking for something very simple for my little boy and had a lots of troubles.Most of the potties I looked at were constructed in a manner of a throne or a spaceship and I didn`t want anything like that.This potty is very simple and easy to wash and doesn`t have no distracting blings.Just what the doctor prescribed
I'll get to the plot of "The Gang's All Here" in a minute, because the --- plot isn't the most memorable part of this movie. The most memorable part is the bananas. ---  --- About 20 minutes into the movie, a towering hat of Technicolor fruitappears on the screen, followed by its owner--"Brazilian bombshell" Carmen Miranda. She proceeds to do a number called "The Lady in the Tutti-Frutti Hat," accompanied by chorus girls who bear bananas. Six-foot-tall bananas that continuously droop and sprout until number's end, when the chorus girls, worn out by the burden of this mutated fruit, lay down for a long siesta on a stage dressed up like an island. ---  --- There's a reason this number occurs so early on: It takes you the rest of the movie to convince yourself you actually saw this in a 1943 movie. ---  --- But then, this is Busby Berkeley, a director who staged his musical numbers as though he was declaring war. And next to kitsch, war is pretty much the motivator here. ---  --- The wafer-thin story involves Andy (James Ellison), a soldier who woos and wins Edie (Alice Faye), a canteen dancer, the nightbefore Andy goes off to World War Two. In what seems an instant, Andy gets decorated and returned home to a victory party thrown by the family of Andy's childhood sweetheart and fiancee--who, unfortunately for Edie, is not Edie.   --- Will the heartbreak be resolved? Do you really care? The plot is --- mostly an excuse for some snappy repartee between major '40s --- stars (in particular, Eugene Pallette and Edward Everett Horton are --- hilarious), and the kind of musical numbers that seem to drop out --- of thin air. (In a couple of scenes, Benny Goodman and his --- orchestra stroll by and do some songs just for the heck of --- it.) ---  --- "The Gang's All Here" is really a 1943 time capsule, but an --- eye-popping rouser of one. They don't make 'em like this anymore. --- They didn't make 'em much like this back then, either
This product is great! I had always been a non believer but in the eight month with my second pregnancy when I could not take the strecth marks, the itching the pain the red skin, I used it and it was like magic. Three days of use and I am a new person with soooo much better skin, getting better everyday
These are great little toys, and my three year old is obsessed with them! He's getting most of them for Christmas, but we've already bought him a few. They're die cast, so they are a good weight, but note that some of them have plastic pieces as well. ---  --- Even though I like these toys, I'm only giving them two stars. This is a horrible price!! I honestly bought Sally today at my local K-Mart, and it was on sale for $2.89 (normally $3.19). Now I know when items are scarce and in high demand their price goes up, but this is a crazy markup. I understand that this is a third party seller, but Amazon should note with their sellers that there is a difference between mark up for high demand toys and rip offs. I have purchased Chick Hicks ($9.50) and Lizzie ($5.00) off of eBay, but I've been able to find the rest of the cars at my local Targets, Wal-Marts, K-Marts, etc. It takes time and searching, but it beats paying these prices
I've been getting this magazine since it first came out years ago, and every issue is just as exciting as the first. It not only gives you the military aspect of events, but often goes into detail as to how and why these events occured, which is invaluable in itself. I can't wait for the next issue to come out, and wish it would come out more often. And the fact that it comes in hardcover format makes a nice presentation on my bookshelf. Thank you MH
THIS GAME IS EDUCATIONAL BECAUSE U R ASKING QUESTION`S TO OTHER PEOPLEAND IF THIER WRONG THEY HEAR THE ANWSER ANYWAY SO I THINK U SHOULD BUY THIS GAME BECAUSE IT WILL TEACH UR KIDS ALOT.I WISH ALL U PARENTS AND CHILDREN GOOD LUCK
KILL MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!   THIS MOVIE IS THE WORST MOVIE OF ALL, ALL, ALL, TIME SINCE THE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE AND BEFORE THAT! IN THEATERS I WAS THE ONLY ONE WATCHING THAT MOVIE AND I FELT LIKE WALKING OUT!! I WANTED TO CRY  :( THE ACTORS STINK ALONG WITH THE PLOT AND 3-D EFFECTS!!! ---  --- All I can say is BOOOOOOOOOO THIS MOVIE SUCKS
I got the Fusion razor in the mail a few weeks ago so I decided to give it a try.  At first it seemed ok, but I started noticing that it pulled at the hair on my face more than my Mach 3 turbo.  I decided to experiment and shave half of my face with a Mach 3 Turbo and the other half with the Fusion.  From my experience, the Mach 3 Turbo gave a closer shave, and glided much smoother across my skin than the Fusion.  I think the 5 blades on the Fusion are more of a gimmick than anything else.  And as cool as the single trimming blade is, it seems like Gillette had to include this because of the poor accuracy of having 5 blades.  In other words, the single blade is a fix rather than a feature.  My call is if your using a Mach 3 Turbo, don't waste your money on the Fusion
I bought these slippers for my husband at Christmas time.  I thought if I  --- spent $50 on slippers they would last a long time, and be made very well. --- I was wrong.  The slippers look good, and the upper leather is very nice --- but the sole is a cheap, thin foam.  If you bend it, it snaps.  You would  --- expect to find this on a cheap, $2 flip flop.  I was very disappointed.  I bought my husband a cheap $2 pair of suede slippers in Walmart that were just as nice with a thick rubber sole. 
I found this to be a absurd movie. It just has alot of things in it that are just too far-fetched, and the plot itself wasn't a strong one at that. To me it just seemed that it was trying to be a slapstick pirate movie, and it just didn't work. It tried to be a movie that all the family could watch, and it didn't work. It tried to be a disaster movie, and it didn't work. It tried to be a drama, and again it didn't work. I got a few chuckles out of it, it held my interest for maybe the 45 minutes to an hour that I watched it, but it was just sloppy, and uneven, and the best thing was watching most of the pirates in drag at the beginning.
this is one of the best in its class for the low price. quick, and responsive, and very convenient for a frequent web browser. the back and forward buttons on it work like a charm and are perfect for the web
As a potential interior designer, I find that this magazine is both realistic and elegant in the articles it provides for the professional and for the hobbiest.  I have a subscription and I find that studying the designers, the styles and the themes I have learned so much about the work of a designer.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys color, fabrics or just pictures of beautifully designed rooms and interiors
Contrary to the previous review, the majority of the patterns in the Fall/Winter 2005 issue were normal sizes (5'6").  This particular issue contains 10 jackets (two of which were for petites), four skirts (one of them petite), three pants (one petite), and four shells (two petites).  There were no dresses and no blouses with sleeves.  The interesting fabric choices and the superb fashion photography were also excellent.  This particular issue also had an article on how to change a petite pattern to a regular pattern and vice versa.  The pattern pieces have unique sophisticated shapes, very interesting for the intermediate to advanced sewer.  One thing I did find lacking was there was no casual sportswear.  The magazine seems geared toward business suits and formal occasions. 
Whether you are a technical guru or someone who's emphasis is on the words, any serious filmmaker who takes his or her craft seriously will love American Cinematographer.  The official magazine of the American Society of Cinematographers, this magazine gives you in depth interviews with DPs and Directors on the technical approach towards the shooting of the picture.  They cover not just lab soups and lighting techniques, but also the approach to the script, design notes on how to visually approach the script - in other words, a great detailed overview of how this particular crew of filmmakers went about creating the visual language of the film.  And not just film - as technology advances, and more films are shot on video, this magazine gives the same great coverage to those pictures as well - from Star Wars to Anniversary Party.  While it's true that there are only so many films that AC can cover each issue but I think you'll end up feeling like I do - that I wish they could cover them all
My tracfone has good reception. i like that it has free call waiting and free caller id. if you haven't activated your tracfone yet then the 'refer a friend program' will give each of us 100 free minutes. please send me an email and i will send you a fast referral. it's a win/win! thank you. 
If you have an older systemworks loaded, NSW will go to remove the older GO BACK version.  If it does, (depending on your system) OK.  However, if it wants you to go to Symantek web site and download a GO BACK removal toll, beware.  I downloaded it and ran it and it stated it wanted to restart my system.  What it did was screw up the partition and crashed the system.  GO Back puts your data in a seperate partition.  Symantek knows about this and has a "fix" you run before loading NSW, but they didn't let anyone know that it may crash your system.  On an older PC, without windows restore tool, it works OK.  However, if you have a newer PC with a windows resotre loaded and then have an older NSW GO back loaded, it will crash your PC if you use their GO Back removal tool.  Emailed Symantec twice, they stated they would get back in 7 days - never did.  Hope you have better luc
Every once in a while you come across a product that does just what you wanted it to.  The Snapstream remote is one of them. ---  --- I just recently built a home theater pc through which I play music and movies. However, the HTPC is in a different room than my projector and I needed a way to operate the pc remotely while in the theater room.  I chose the Snapstream remote for this function and have been well pleased. ---  --- I also highly recommend the Snapstream remote for those people using or looking to use the Beyond TV PVR solution.  I record all my favorite TV programs on my HTPC in high-def and able to access them with a single click of a button via the Snapstream remote. ---  --- This is one product that I can recommend with no reservations
First off that has to be the worst rhyme I've ever heard in my life...  Andre Nickatina (in the rapping world) is one of the worst i've ever heard, but if you're into dope beats and his style in flowing with them (reminds me of someone on the ocean just being carried by waves, paddling every which way to stay with them), and what i mean by that is he tries to keep up with the pace and the beat and says (what feels like) every single thing that pops into his head from coke to what he had for dinner that night.  But overall, "if you can't dig it like its shovelled man i guess you ain't able" summs this and the rest of the Nickatina c.d.s up
I truly enjoyed the beautiful photos in this book.  Lots of ideas and details in the photos.  It would be hard for you NOT to pick up some ideas for your own home---just from looking at the photos. Well done
Most of the movie, the parts that work anyway, is like a visual kei band's music video, and it's nice to have that kewl aesthetic without the bad music that usually accompanies it. The movie's concept is something that could have only come from asia, where filmmakers seem to digest american influences and refashion them into something that seems to miss the whole point of what made the original ideas work. The kooky Face/Off being a prime example of this insanity. The cop movie setup seems like needless window dressing, anchoring the visually oriented fantasy content in a reality it needn't have any relevence to, but I guess even Alice In Wonderland, Labyrinth, and the Nightmare On Elm Street series used the device of having it be all in a dream. It's not a story driven movie and to grade it as such would be unfair. It's a surrealist visual art project, something that barely exists in cinema, and although it would be better placed in the context of some worthwhile characters and plot, it is making progressive and original use of the film medium. It's much like The Corpse Bride in that regard, except this film will weird you out with twists of random insanity instead of bore you with tedius monotony and musical numbers. Criticisms from one-star reviewers such as "pure eye candy, no story" couldn't be more accurate, but if you'd ever go to look at an art exhibit, this film is equally worth a look. 
Following 2002's self-produced and underrated Under Rug Swept, Morissette returns in 2004 with So-Called Chaos. With this release, Morissette has done a complete makeover of her look with a serious haircut and sporting a look of casual glamour like she's aspiring to take Hollywood by strom but isn't 100% sure. Maybe the new look and image might have worked if Morissette's makeover in sound was good enough to go with it-but it's not. This CD starts out good with the opening cut "Eight Easy Steps," a fast-paced rockin' tune with Alanis at the wheel of leadership but also ready to bust her own chops at the same moment. "Out is Through" follows and also stands out, but then So-Called Chaos begins to turn problematic by not having an edge. And Morissette should never have brought John Shanks or Tim Thorney(or both)on board for assistance because she was left with bland arrangements behind many of the tracks. "Doth I Protest Too Much" is without a doubt the worst song Alanis has ever recorded. The title song attempts for a gritty and gutsy feel but even that attempt becomes overshadowed by Morissette's lyrics(yes, not her best work)when she refers to heartburn, headaches, and breached contracts as primary results of a chaotic lifestyle. The tracks continue with "All of Me," and "This Grudge," both rather dull, while the closing track "Everything" was a weak choice for the first single. Morissette has always been a progressive artist, but So-Called Chaos doesn't measure up to any of its predecessors, and may leave many fans longing to see the girl with the jagged heart still spinning with her free-flowing locks firmly in place.
We are "training" and really were looking for a useful aid.  It didn't work for us, allowing the entire car seat and straps to become saturated.  We will continue to use it with our younger child, IN HOPES of avoiding a diaper "leak through" accident.
This item was very nice.  The chain was longer than I expected and hangs really low on my neck, but it only looks like the real one.  You can tell that it is a knock off, but you get what you pay for.  For $5 I think that it was worth it, but it does look different than the "real" one.  Good service and delivery
Terry's son, Nile, has honored his father (and done the rest of us a huge favor) by publishing this collection of the best of Terry's shorter works. ---  --- Terry concluded at one point that film had surpassed literature as the communication medium of choice, and devoted most of the rest of his life to that arena. His interview "On Screenwriting" describes both the benefits and the frustrations associated with that choice. His advice is just as relevant to the would-be screenwriter today as it was when he wrote it. ---  --- His "Proposed Scene for Kubrick's Rhapsody," and "Plums and Prunes," provide interesting examples of proposed movie scenes that will prove interesting to readers unfamiliar with that arcane art. ---  --- As other reviewers have noted, "Grooving in Chi" is an excellent description of the Chicago riots during the Democratic National Convention in 1968. ---  --- Finally, pieces like "The Beautiful-Ugly Art of Lotte Lenya," "When Film Gets Good," "Rolling Over Our Nerve-Endings [William Burroughs]," and "Writers at Work [Henry Green]" prove that he could write serious criticism. ---  --- Through it all flows that wonderful, irreverent, sense of humor. ---  --- Good stuff
This dispenser is easy to install and works perfectly every time. After initially filling the dispensers, it took several pumps for the product to dispense but after that it comes out on the first push of the button. It has been very convenient in my shower and no more shampoo bottles all over the shower! It also saves on my shampoo because the kids just push the button twice to dispense the amount they need instead of pouring shampoo out of the bottles and using more than they need
I love these boots! I got one size smaller than my street shoe and they were snug enough to fit perfect. I can fit pants in them or over them and I have not had a problem yet
MariaS and Srayle, if you like the Guaraldi original then keep it and chuck the Winston,  Personally, I think the Winston performance is refreshing and a delightful 'twist' on Guaraldi's works.  The piano is brillaint sounding and at volume, thru a good system sounds like there's a piano in the room.  It should be emphatically understood, you are buying Winston in this case, and not Guaraldi.  I have both versions
Yes, it's easy to install, configure and use. The footprint is small and it doesn't hog resources. That's the good news. The bad news is that this software's virus detection rate is abysmal and the company's tech support is worse. So, in short, don't *trust* it.  ---  --- Two examples, starting with tech support. After building a new computer, I had several blue screens (stop errors, BSODs) and my analysis seemed to indicate that EZ Antivirus was at least partially responsible. I emailed support with all the relevant info. Their (paraphrased) reply: "We understand that you are having Faults in Windows. This is because you have Windows installed. If you did not have Windows you would not have Faults. Thank you for contacting E-Trust." I should have that engraved on a plaque.  ---  --- Example 2, AV detection: When my subscription ran out, I uninstalled EZ and tried a demo of Kaspersky. It found 5 viruses on my computer that EZ never told me about. In this case, it's 2 strikes and you're out. Goodby, Computer Associates
I purchased the game to play at a christmas party.  It was a lot of fun.   --- Thank yo
I bought this item after much research and this particular model was suggested to me by a friend.  No problems at all with shipping; package was in perfect shape though only delivered to my back steps.  I opened up the box and brought in pieces individually, with the flywheel being the heaviest (though I was able to bring in myself).  It took me about 2 hours to put together.  Instruction book was better than most I have seen, and only problem was the misprint in bolt sizes, but you can figure that out easily (as everyone has noted on their reviews).  The elliptical's size is on the smaller size and fits well in my sitting room.  Easily moved if need be. --- In regards to the workout.  I cross train on my treadmill and found this workout to be as effective.  There are a variety of programs so you can vary your workout.  The backward motion is a little awkward for me (I am 5'3") but found that holding onto the lower handlebars works well (versus the movable upper ones).  The machine is very quiet, only slight squeeking coming from the upper handlebars that disappeared with a little WD40.  It has very smooth movement and you can definitely tell a difference with increasing the level, which I was worried about as it doesn't have an incline as some gym machines do.  The heel rise can occur when you do not sit back on your heels when working out, so you just need to be aware of your foot placement.  The foot pads are comfortable and a good size.   --- Most of all, for those who do monitor their heart rate, I have a Polar F11 heart monitor (with chest strap) and this monitor is within a 3 beat difference at the most.  I recommend to let the monitor read for a minumum of 45 seconds before you follow the rate.  This held true for me even if pacing at 70 RPM's or above.  I listen to my IPOD when I work out, so I have not used the book holder.  The water holder holds 24 oz Polar Spring bottles without any difficulty taking out and replacing the bottle. --- I highly recommend this for anyone who is looking at increasing their fitness level in the comfort of their own home.  It's very well built/solid, quiet, effective, and affordable ($599, free pad, free shipping)
Overall a nice product, powerful, good looking, but with a few quirks.  Feed/auto on mechanism a little picky as to the angle that you insert your paper.  Recommend putting entire unit in a big trash bag when emptying, otherwise shredded bits go flying to the floor.  Make sure to put the lid on the basket in proper orientation or motor won't run; look for the little metal rail on the inside top right of the basket, if it's not there rotate the basket 180 degrees and then put the top on.  
This coffee had an off, sour taste. It's almost as if it "went bad," as in Milk that's past the date. I only made one cup before throwing out the rest of the bag. I certainly won't be ordering this brand again
Well you know the rest. Aside from her brash repetative demeanor her cooking has a lot to be desired. These meals CANNOT be done in 30 minutes, unless that is if you want everything half cooked. The book makes false promises and does not deliver. There are also NO PICTURES and NO INDEX and the recipes are very confusing..most of them deriving from an original Master recipe and then just changing one or two things. If you want good food and a good cook book don't buy into the hype and don't buy this book.
I've owned a pair of 587s for 18 months, wearing them exclusively as walking shoes full-time in the summer and very little the rest of the year. While the shoes are comfortable, I was disappointed at how fast they're falling apart. The padding around the ankle has torn, there are small holes in the top of the toe box from my big toes, and I was surprised to see the description of these shoes on this website to include the statement, "The solid rubber outsole delivers long-wearing durability." That's been my major complaint with these shoes; shortly after I got them, the soles cracked at the heel, and now layers of the soles are peeling off. ---  --- I recommend buying another model..
I often wonder if some if not most of the people writing rave reviews, 5 stars, are really paid, biased, professionals pumping up the movie for increased DVD sales. --- 
I definitely can tell when a great game show can be fun as a board game. Unfortunately, that absolutely isn't always the case. One of my all time favorite quiz shows back in the 80's was Super Password with Bert Convy. The game of course showcases a celebrity and a regular contestant trying to guess their way to guess a mystery word for a puzzle. This edition doesn't reflect on that edition. This board game edition is a example of the original Password with the late Allen Ludden. The game is still fun and enjoyable for those who actually haven't seen the original Password like myself, but it is just delightful. Unfortunately, it isn't much fun reflecting on this version and relating to the Bert Convy edition. Hopefully, when Password is remade, it will be just like the themed 80's edition of the NBC game show. ---  --- Price: B- ---  --- Game: C 1/2+ ---  --- Fun & Enjoyment: B- ---  --- Overall: C
First impressions: It's a nice watch with a clear look. I was a little worried about the lack of backlighting, but was pleasantly suprised that I was able to see the luminescent dials clearly at any hour of the night. ---  --- Pros: Quick atomic time synchronization (usually within one to two minutes after the initial synchronization). Simple to use.  ---  --- Cons: Case is described as stainless steel, but back piece is plastic. Originally listed by Amazon as a solar-powered watch, but instead powered by regular battery. Battery life expectancy about 2 years, though it may lost longer by disabling the auto-sync feature. ---  --- Overall comments: This is my first atomic time wrist-watch. It automatically synchronizes with atomic time once at midnight (a function you can disable if desired) or on-demand with the press of a button or two. It does this by scanning for a radio signal. According to the instructions, you're supposed to leave this watch near a window with the 6-o'clock side facing the window for best radio-signal reception. Reception can of course vary depending on your location, but the watch has successfully updated several times even while I was wearing it. --- I like watches with flat crystal surfaces, because it allows me to paste a PDA screen-proctector (cut to size, of course) on them, which keeps the crystal from scratching. The crystal on this watch is only slightly curved, and in only one direction, meaning a screen protector sticks nicely and evenly to it. --- The watch is waterproof to 50 meters, which (in Casio terms) means you can go swimming with it, but you should not press any buttons underwater. I try to keep my watches away from water when I can, but it's always good to know that it should survive most water-related mishaps
I bought this tea for my mom for her birthday, and everyone in the family loves it. This is excellent chai tea
I bought this for my wife because of it's low cost. You get what you pay for. She uses it a few times a week. After a little more then a month, the left pedal broke. She is not overweight at all, so that wasn't the problem. --- I'll spend the money for a good one next time
For those not aware, Pumpkinhead 2 is (supposedly) the 1994 sequel to 1988's timeless monster classic, Pumpkinhead. The original was darkly creepy, superbly constructed in it's story, and featured a wonderfully original costume for the creature. Pumpkinhead 2 fails at being slightly horrorific, butchers the story, and basically uses the name and a simliar creature-suit to create an otherwise completely irrelevant "sequel". It's like a group of writers saw a picture of Pumpkinhead on the internet, read his name (and that's ALL they read), and decided to make their own movie. As for the plot (if anyone cares), a deformed boy dies and comes back as a monster to exact revenge on the people who hurt his feelings. I'll admit, if they had altered the look of the creature a bit and had chosen a different name for the movie, this would've been worth two or three stars as a "so bad it's good" B flick. But the fact that they totally butchered the original by attempting to connect this garbage to it really kills it. If you haven't seen 1988's Pumpkinhead, rent it or buy it -- it's a horror masterpiece (especially compared to this) with so much going for it. But avoid this sequel at all costs. I hate to put down any product, but I feel that this one deserves it
This rangefinder is great! Much lighter than the big bulky other units. Has all the great features that is needed. This is one that you will take with you and not leave in the truck because it's too big.  I tested this against some of my buddies' bigger units at known distances and this one out did the bigger units in speed and accuracy. Great scan mode. Best buy.  Should be sold for about ($) more than asked for
These are one of two brands that my daughter does not soak through in the night. They wash up nicely and seem as good as the day I bought them. My only wish is that they had fold back laundry tabs for the velcro. They stick to other things in the wash. I think this puts extra wear on the velcro too
This magazine is a waste of money and bores me.  Nothing here to see but ads
This program sucks. I used it last year and thought that it was unwieldy and really confusing (i.e. unlike TurboTax and other programs, there's very little transparency in the system). Then I bought it again this year because the store that I went to was out of Turbotax, and I needed to get my taxes done quickly. This year was even worse than last year - not only was it still unwieldy and irritating, but it gave me figures that simply did not make sense.  The results for the federal return were OK, but it gave me figures that would have cost me over $2,000 in taxes that I did NOT owe on my state return. I ended up going online to double check my results using a cheap ($10) online service recommended by the NY state tax website. Within 45 minutes, I cleared the online source, and got results that made far more sense. I have no idea what happened with TaxCut, but I suspect that they may have been missing a field somewhere along the line - this is a problem that has been noted by a number of others in reviews on a variety of sites. I will NOT be buying this product again
We installed this external HD on a Dell computer. As most Dell customers will attest to, any time you talk to one of their representatives, they'll deny compatability with anything other than a Dell product. Well, I have upgraded the video card, power supply, and now added this HD to the computer with very liitle effort. This HD has performed perfectly for us.
I read Successful Farming, Progressive Farming and Backwoods Home for years.  They are all fine magazines.  But if you want to do a little hobby farm this magazine really fits.  They have a wealth of information in each copy.  I'm really impressed.  It's really targeted to those people who have five to thirty acres, a few animals and may or may not want to make a little money on this side or as minimum have fun but do it the right way.  My first copy was their tractor issue.  Very good info.  And I'm an engineer
Long time MSL subscriber.  I get out my dec, dec/jan issues every holiday season to see what works for ornaments and decorations and such.  I loved the cookie issue last year, definite keeper.  Her projects involve time and materials, but you end up with something that will last, and instructions are generally very clear.  I've seen that since her trial/jail, the high end advertisors have almost entirely backed out, which means adds for average joes, like me.  I really appreciate the depth that the mag goes into a certain subject, even if its not a particular fave of mine.  --- I haven't really watched the Martha show much, I really enjoyed the original MSL show she started with.  Sometimes I get annoyed that the materials seem very exclusive to New York and similiar, but c'est la vie
you can connect this to the game boy player as well plus connect it to the e-reader to download e-reader information into your cub
  I am a traveling songwriter and just finished a 6000+ mile tour from Nebraska to Florida with this on the top of my Subaru and I must say it was great thing to have- everything stayed bone-dry and secure but I would recommend usuing a couple of extra bungee cords across the top just as an added measure- plenty of room and solid construction- for the price it can't be beat
Our daughter got one of these for Christmas. She's taken it out twice on pavement and the rear wheel (which is make out of plastic) broke. I regret paying what I did for this one, not because of what the going price is now but because it's a piece of junk. ---  --- DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP
This was a gift for my 2 year old last christmas.  The screws they provide to put the wheels on are no good. As soon as your child starts "walk" his new dog, the wheels completely unscrew, which can be a terrible choking hazzard.  We have tried everything to keep them on.  Plus the leash tore off from around poor spot's neck, and no type of glue seems to keep it on. I'm afraid this cute little toy is going into the trash. It was good idea and a cute toy, but not worth the money. You're better off buying a plastic, already put together one.
The thing wouldn't even fit around my handle bar; I had to zip-tie it on.  A waste of $$. 
I don't know why most of the reviews are so negative.  Mine works perfectly, it does not flip-flop, does not drop down and you can remove those thingies inside to make the water pressure higher for a more soothing shower experience. ---  --- Reason I gave it 4 stars is because I have what is called a "diverter valve" attached to my shower head.  The waterpik is meant to be installed DIRECTLY onto the shower head itself.  I could not do that, because I have a portable "wand" that is moveable via hose connected to the valve and noticed that the threading is too short for the waterpik to latch on to. ---  --- Went to Home Depot and got an extension and a coupling, kind of ingenious and used lots of pipe tape to "interface" the waterpik via the extension, via the coupling ONTO the diverter valve..... Wow!  NO LEAKS!  Works PERFECTLY. ---  --- For those of you out there that has a diverter valve for more then one showerhead option, go to Home Depot, Lowe's or a hardware store and what I wrote above will work as it did for me. ---  --- Enjoy

Man, these things are good.  I used to eat Pop-Tarts all the time, but it eventually got to the point that a) I got tired of Pop-Tarts and b) they seemingly just stopped making them like they used to.  Instead of being good and soft like they're supposed to be, Pop-Tarts morphed into hard pastries that felt and tasted like they had been left out in the air for a couple of days.  These new Go-Tarts, at least the frosted strawberry ones, are just right - soft pastries with just the right amount of strawberry inside them to give you that elusive strawberry twang taste (some of you may know what I'm talking about here).  These things are ready to eat right out of the pack - so "ready to eat," in fact, that there's a message on each package stating that you should not put them in a toaster or microwave.  If you're the daredevil sort and insist on breaking Kellogg's prescribed rules, I can't stop you - but don't blame me if your microwave explodes or something.   ---  --- Of course, one little 1.2 oz. bar isn't enough for anyone bigger than a Chihuahua puppy, so volume is an important factor here, which is where these multi-pack boxes come in so handy.  With 140 calories per bar, I don't guess these things will be making any of Jenny Craig's diet plans any time soon, but I say life's too short - eat all you want.  And, with these individually wrapped bars, you won't face the classic Pop-Tart dilemma of having to choose between eating two pastries now or putting one back in the box, knowing that it will taste even more stale later because you've already freed it from its freshness-preserving little tinfoil wrapper thingy
My V180 is through Cingular - I never have a dropped call and reception is excellent. Long Battery life, very easy menus/wayfinding and small size. No frills like MP3 player or camera however - just a very good phone
The Premium Vehicle Power Charger was not compatible.  I returned i
When I received the earrings I got very disappointed because they are very very small. I had to sell them, my wife never wanted to wear them
The advertisement picture shows the cover below the top of the wheels.  The cover I received was a full 3 inches above the top of the wheels and left the bottom storage rack fully exposed to the weather
We love this game.  All members of the family can play it and we've enjoyed it as a family many time
I bought this seat cover for my daughter she loves anything with frogs on it they are really cute. a friend had bought her one so I said I would get her the other to match and she really loves them. she said that she wished that they made them for the back seat of her car also
This seat does not fit in any snap and go stroller and is not exceptionally light.  If I were to do this over, I would buy a different infant seat
I have to start with by saying that I am indeed a very happy user of T600 for almost two years. IIts user friendliness and sheer wealth of applications and uses still keeps me excited.  The device can be used for phone calls, calendars, web browsing, email, IM (ICQ, AOL, etc .. ),  internet radio stations, document editing, games, modem for the laptop... and that is just the beginning. ---  --- So why only two stars?? and why poor execution?  Very poor voice call quality, reported by many and totally unacceptable!!!  Luckily for me and some others; one of the internet enthusiast came up with the solution -- open up the unit and isolating the mic wire with the foil.  It worked, but it should never had to be necessary. ---  --- Also screens are week.  Drop on the hard service will break it.  Luckily for
Set up was easy. Just read the manual and follow the instructions. Don't take short cuts. ---  --- Forcasting is excellent after setting the barometer to match local conditions. We live over 1,000 feet above sea level. Adjusting for that was needed. Weather.com's zip code oriented barometric pressure info made that relatively easy. ---  --- The screen is easy to read and understand. The main unit has a solid feel and does not look cheap. ---  --- The external humidity and temperature sensor fits easily between a closed window and it's screen. ---  --- The manual could be more complete. It wasn't clear that the icon that depicts a connection with the national time service doesn't appear until after the first connection is made in the wee hours of the morning. When you manually set the clock make sure you do it in 24 hour mode. Then, switch to 12 hour mode if that is what you want displayed. Again, the manual should have pointed that out
I had viewed concert photos taken with the S2 from a number of different photographers and they absolutely took my breath away. Saw the output of other cameras in comparison and they didn't even come close. ---  --- I was using the Canon A80 prior and while I was happy with it, my first round of photos with the S2 proved to be most impressive. While you can use this as a point and shoot, this is a camera that you should spend some time learning so that you can get the most from it. And although the S3 is the latest version of the camera, I'm not sure you get that much more for the money
In 2 weeks, I will actually be at the Vatican for my first visit.This wonderful DVD showed me places and things that I will never be able to see as a tourist, but just knowing about the workings of the Vatican will add such a richness of knowledge to visit.  This is a beautifully done 90 min DVD as only National Geographic could have done.  I was thrilled with every minute I spent watching it and will enjoy watching it many more time when I get home --- to remember my trip. 
I use this cereal for not only cereal, but also to make rice crispy treats. Yum
I bought this croquet set late last summer for backyard get-togethers with the neighbors. None of us had played before, so we didn't need top-of-the-line, and the price was right on this set. It's everything it needs to be: weighty, colorful, and compact in its case. The widgets are pretty bendy, but if they bend out of shape, they bend right back. Turned out to be a good investment. A word of warning if you have small dogs: put them in the house before you let your neighbors loose with mallets and round projectiles. My little dachshund picked up the bad habit of chasing the balls and pushing them further off-course. It was funny, until she darted into the path of one bright orange ball, which made solid contact with her little head. (She's fine now, but is no longer a fan of the game.) All in all, I would highly recommend having a set like this around if you have the room in your backyard and fun neighbors
My husband purchased the Pedometer with FM radio for me.  I loved it and used it non-stop for about a week.  After a week the battery case top fell off so I could not keep the batteries in.  The FM radio worked only once - I thought I had a short in the headset.  Good idea but really did not perform/last for the money
Bought new around $80.  CD player and LCD CLOCK stopped working within 6 months--now nap function and radio are all that works--if only I could find the damn receipt!!!
I love this movie!  I could not find it in any store, and Amazon.com had it!  MY movie came very quickly and in great condition
Richard Fortney's "Earth" is a survey, in mostly layman's terms, of the geological history of the Earth and how it relates to humankind.  Fortney tells the story by means of a journey around the earth, selecting a series of locations where the earth's geology is apparent, and usually the meaning of that geology was debated by scholars to a greater understanding.   ---  --- Fortney starts at Mount Vesuvius in Italy, preceeds to the Hawaiian Islands, hence to the Swiss Alps and to other locations aroudn the world.  Fortney relates the geology of each chosen location to plate tectonics as a means to explain how each terrain come to be the way it is.  This leads into extended and sometimes fascinating discussions of the former alignements of the continents in prior ages such as the "supercontinent" of Gondwana.  For each location, Fortney also relates the effects of the terrain on the history of the humans who have lived in that location.  Along the way, Fortney drives home the sheer vastness of the timescale of earth and its geological processes.  The dedicated reader will view his landscape with a new perspective. ---  --- Fortney is a gifted writer with a good eye for the illustrative anecdote.  Large portions of this book will be fascinating to the reader with at least some schooling in the sciences.  It turns out, for example, that the complicated geology of Newfoundland results from its origin as pieces of three different tectonic plates (North America, ocean bottom, and Northern Europe).  The descriptions of Northwest Scotland as the remains of truly ancient mountains are put into appropriate scale in part by Fortney's historical anecdotes and by his experiences of rockhounding in the often cold rainy weather of the Scottish Highlands. ---  --- The narrative runs a little long at over 400 pages, and Fortney's explanations will sometimes outrun the scientific background of the average reader.  Nevertheless, this book is highly recommended to the reader with at least a casual interest in geology and its links to human history
Classy look and very durable. Very nice watch for the price. I bought mine at a discount store and paid about $6 more for it. I like it, despite its 10mm thickness. Not that heavy if you're like me, 6'2" and 250lbs. It's a man's watch, practical yet with some style while not being trendy. I haven't had any problems with it so far, despite having dropped it twice and worn it outside while working and getting it soaked with sweat multiple times. I don't find it uncomfortable at all and I forget I am wearing it. (I suggest taking it off, the leather band doesn't clean easily like a metal band.) I'm considering buying a second one and keeping it cleaner this time. (Lesson learned.
I have tried many brands of soy shakes, and this one is delicious.. I sure recomend it to anyone that wants to start the healthy habit of drinking soy. Cookies & Cream flavor tastes like a real shake!! I really enjoy this drinks
I received this as a Christmas gift and thought, "Why not... I'll try it."  The woman who bought the gift for me also has one and told me NOT TO APPLY ANY PRESSURE when using the device.  As a redhead, I have extremely sensitive, thin skin so I followed her advice very carefully.  I did not apply any pressure what-so-ever, and didn't keep the device in one area for too long.  The result..... worse than any sunburn I've ever had!  My legs are burned in various areas, as the product sanded off the first layer of my skin!  The skin hardened and has begun to crack in the burned areas.  I'm a little concerned and think I should call my physician, as the condition is extremely painful.  Worst of all, the hair grew back immediately the next day and I had to shave the areas that were not burned.  This is a terrible, dangerous product!  
The scent is so unforgettable, fresh and sexy and sweet and... it's just the best among the best
I got this phone cause I thought it would be a nice little phone. Wrong. Yes it plays songs. Yes it is little. Too little!!!! This phone is not made for someone who has med to large fingers. The voice dialing DOES NOT WORK! It is hard to use. I returned the phone after only 2 DAYS! I got the Samsung T629. TOTALLY better. Does almost everything the Nokia does, but is better, looks better performs much better. If you are a teenager this phone may be good for you. The Samsung even sounds better. Get the Samsung, same price more phone
Extremely difficult to dig through the excessive examples in order to find the relevant theorems and results. Because of this, the problems at the end of each chapter become exercises in tedium, as more time is spent searching for the necessary theorems in the text than in actually working out the solution.  ---  --- I do not recommend
Thought I'd just confirm what I've learned too.  I bought it, realized after research it could be picked in seconds with a pen and returned it
A magazine my children love as much as I do!!!  We homeschool and love to plan lessons around all the fun articles and recommended activities.  My children look forward to each and every copy.  And guess what???  NO ADS!!
Read the reviews and picked the elephant for my 17m old child's nusery. I absolutely love it. Before this, my son could not sleep well with our "family's" humiifier because it was too noisy. Within an hour of bringing this home, it was set up (very easily) and he took one of many 2 1/2 hour naps that week! No filters, No noise, NO PROBLEMS thus far! I did have it on high for the first 20 mins and found a puddle of water underneath, but the humidifier was near a window, and i am asumming there was a draft that may have directed the steam toward the dresser top. (The problem was resolved once moved unto a different surfacetop) Filling it is a snap and the very fine mist (looked like small stream of fog) was a pleasure to see out of the trunk of the animal! The tank seems to last longer than the box states. It is on it's third day on a low/med setting and it still only has a 3 inch difference at the top. I love the safety features and I don't have to worry about the tank still on if it's empty since it has an automatic shut off! The light is not a problem since he likes to have a tiny bit of light in his room. It is a design that will last thoughout his childhood! Thank you Crane!
I got this for my daughter awhile ago, but due to no snow, I had to wait to actually see if it worked.  Well, it did!   Nicely made and durable.  Daughter loved it. 
Many of my colleague use blackberry for emails but I give a try on this brand-new 3G/Wi-fi/camera equipped smartphone.  The 3G and Wi-fi works very well in our area.  It also worked very well in Europe after activation of the cellphone by Cingular customer service.  E-mail and internet works very well in both locations.  Addition of 1GB microSD chip actually solve many of the bluetooth file transfer issues, since I can simply stick the microSD card into regular SD cassette, and use a card reader and USB cable for file transfer from PC or Mac like other memory chips.  The color calibration and default focus of the camera is very good and video is very good quality for the cameraphone.  Again, 1GB allow you to take a very long video in Windows Media Player format.  Installation of Good mail system automatically synchronize to Lotus Note emails, contacts, and calendar any time, any place, and automatically chime schedule notices. The only drawback are the battery life, which require frequent charges, slow keypad for phone calls (and I do not know how to silence the keypad), and a little tough keyboard touch.  Lack of shift keys on both sides sometimes makes key typing difficult (especially shift+A !).  In addition, Microsoft Word processing is slow, and so as Excel, which will require a faster chip. Overall, a great all-around pocket PC in this generation
I walk pretty much the same distance daily, and this device gave me wildly different readings for the same route. I could see being off by even 100 steps for variations in stride, etc. But off by thousands of steps? Hardly worth it
This movie was just plain bad. It doesn't just stink, it reeks. If I was to say this movie was horrible that would be a compliment. ---  ---  I can't believe that the other reviews were so complimentary. It's the reason why I purchased the movie and I regret my decision.  ---  --- I should have read the reviews more closely. Some of the reviewers hadn't acutally seen the film while I am convinced that a few of the other reviews were written by people associated with the film.  ---  --- Everything about this movie is sup-par. The script was horrible. The sets amateurish. The dialogue stilted. (And not in the funny style reminiscent of the TV series - which I loved). There are a number of things about the movie that were warning signs that this movie was going to stink. ---  --- First the only footage they used was from the Batman movie. Not the TV series. I have a feeling that the people who have the rights to the TV series realized that this movie was so bad they didn't want to associate themselves with it. They didn't use the original Batmobile but a cheap rip off. I could continue by why make you suffer. ---  --- The chemistry between Adam West and Burt Ward is non-existent. And the chemistry between the `actors' playing Adam West and Burt Ward in the `flashback' scenes is substandard at best.  ---  --- This movie is beyond dreadful. There are cameos from a few villains from the original TV show but they're dreadful too. Not because they are bad actors but because the script and plot are that bad. I wish I could say I laughed. I wish I could say that I at least cracked a smiled but unfortunately all I can say is that I watched this movie in dead silence.  ---  --- DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME ON THIS MOVI
The XMB-10 is a great way to listen to my XM Audiovox receiver at home. The boombox is slightly larger than I desired, but the sound is great, it's easy to use, lightweight, very portable and nice looking.
As the reviews below indicate, "Arthur" has a lot of fans -- when it was released in 1981 Vincent Canby of the New York Times found it a wonderful "screwball comedy" (although over time, Times readers, perhaps more discerning than Vincent, have only rated it 3 out of 5 stars) and Bravo listed it #10 on its list of Best Comedies (see below). I first saw Dudley Moore in "Foul Play," thought he was very funny. Based upon that, I bought "10" and "Arthur," as it turned out a downward trajectory. ---  --- What I dislike about "Arthur" is Moore playing a loud, obnoxious drunk telling unfunny jokes, and Minelli playing a salt-of-the-earth working girl who loves Arthur for himself, not for his $750 million fortune. Even John Gielgud, who was great in "The Loved One" a much better comedy, can't resurrect this turkey. ---  --- Okay, folks. Start casting your negative votes. In the meantime, here's the Bravo 100 Best Comedies list: ---  --- 100. Anchorman  --- 99. The Birdcage  --- 98. School of Rock  --- 97. Happy Gilmore  --- 96. Four Weddings and a Funeral  --- 95.

I ordered this pack after my friend's baby shower, she received this as a gift and I was amazed at how nice it was.  It fit both her and her husband very well, so I ordered one to carry our 7 month old daughter in.  WE love it.  It is easily adjustable and fits my husband and myself great.  Our daughter squeals in delight whenever she is in it, it has made our walks more enjoyable, I have free hands to hold our dogs' leashes and she likes being up to see everything.  I only have one complaint and that is the pocket on the belt is almost impossible to access when wearing the pack, but it is so minute of a complaint I still give it 5 stars.  Oh yeah the price is amazing for the pack you get, I cannot wait to go on a day hike.  I had been pricing other packs and they were close to $200, this was$90 w/ free shipping, a huge price break, plus I got it in about 3 days, thanks Amazon
Its great, i bought it for my husband and he loves it. --- The Zen micro fit perfect
These are yummy vegan treats, but they are kinda small for 120 calories and 4.5 grams of fat.  But they are a good snack
What a waste of time to air this up.  It developed leaks in less time to it took to enter the credit card info to order it.  This was the worst gift because it had such a high expectation but turned into the biggest disappointment.  The vinyl was so thin that rolling it over normal bermuda grass created holes from small seed pods and sticks.  Save your money..
We got these earrings for our daughter on her 6th birthday. She loves jewelry and especially earrings. The color is a little pale, the actual earrings aren't quite as pink as they look in the picture. But they are good quality and look great. My daughter wears them all the time. ---  --- This was a good buy. These earrings are great for anyday wearing or with evening wear. They look very stylish
Lamp is nice.Gives excellent lighting for desk work.Buying Partners,LLC was very good in handling a lamp that had problems with the bulb not staying on.The only downsize to owning this lamp is that the 13 Watt bulb can only be purchased at select stores .Seems like discount stores don't carry them.Also,replacement bulbs are expensive( most likely it would be cheaper to just replace the whole lamp than just the bulb).Some reviews on the bulb say that it does not last as long as the 10,000 hours advertised. --- Having said all that,go ahead and purchase the lamp.At the price you can't go wrong.Merry Christmas To All 
Wow!  Shesheido has done it again!  I love thier products!  I have oily skin...so I like to blot my face once a day.  The papers are awesome...very soft.  They soak up the oil and I can tell after I throw the paper away.  Usually 1 sheet a day is all I need and my face is shine-free!  I love them!  I also like this product becuase you get 100 sheets which is the most I have seen so far.  I love this product and will buy again
I bought this item on my own because I read the wonderful reviews it received. I really don't know HOW this item can be used. Even if you don't use the air-vented cups (which collect the leaking milk), you can plainly see the soft shells in loose clothing. I was wearing a sweater & you could see the shape of the shells right through it. If you do use the cups they supply, you look absolutely abnormal. I guess this doesn't work for large-breasted women
I have nothing but good things to say about this purchase and product.  It works and looks great.  I only wish they could make a PDA phone that wasn't as big as a boat
Straps on this shoe are very short and since they close with velcro, they are too short.  I tried to add velcro, but that didn't work.  I had to give the shoes away.  The strap rubbed across the top of the ankle and on the side of the foot and were very uncomfortable.  Would not recommend if you are on the heavy side
I ordered this product for more than what its new price is on December 21, 2006 as a Christmas present for my mother. It didn't arrive until January 9th, and it arrived damaged!  We sent it back for a refund.  On February 2nd, this low-rate item arrived at our doorstep again, AFTER I checked several times by phone to make sure that my order was marked as a RETURN and not an EXCHANGE.  We decided to set it up and see if this one was better.  STILL DAMAGED in another area. I have called The Sharper Image over ten times now over a span of 2 months. I know their customer service number by heart, and I even know their direct customer service number (without having to go through the machine) by heart (call 1-888-344-5555 instead of 1-800...). Their shipment is slow and their processing is painfully slow! They've given me 3 different order numbers without telling me, so I couldn't get accurate information about my order online.  Beware of dealing with this company.  If you can, go into a Sharper Image store somewhere, take the thing out of its box to examine it, and only then consider bringing this product into your house.  One good thing is that they do give you a full refund, tax included.  At least that's what they told me by phone today.  By the way, this should be called a Foldaway Strider, not Elliptical.  It absolutely does not have the elliptical wheel or power that other more functional elliptical machines do
This a wonderful movie. I had never seen it before. I am 65 and was a teenager in the fifties and an avid movie goer. Some of these old black and white films bring back memories of a time when life seemed to begin every moment. It was a time after the war and people were just beginning to discover each other. The old Italian movies had a grittiness to them. A reality from far away places where life just had a different style. La Strada and the Nights of Cabiria were from this time. I feel such a pull watching them, wishing things had never become so modern. The Bicycle Thieves belongs in this catagory. The reproduction is marvelous. Clean and smooth. I am glad that this movie has been restored. Its a beautiful piece of the past.
I've only had this scale for a short time, but so far so good.  I've found that in order to get a scale that is perfect or near perfect you have to spend a boat load of money. As someone before has mentioned the one drawback to this scale is that you have to set it back to zero every so often.  I specifically wanted to get an analog scale for this reason, with an inexpensive digital scale, which is what I had last, you can't reset it like you can an analog.  This scale is a great buy, for only $10 how can you go wrong!
The product arrived quickly and without a hitch. I really liked the earrings when I saw them. They were better than expected. I'm very pleased. Thank you.
Although easy to load a smart card, this viewer was disappointing in quality.  My pictures look fine on my computer, but the pictures were dark and there was no instruction on how to change the contrast etc. (although I found that it the picture could be adjusted, it was never mentioned in the manual).  The manual is, because of the comment above, disgustingly incomplete. If not going through the bother of returning it through Amazon because I purchased it on line, I would not have kept it.  I actually bought another digital frame that was smaller and cheaper and it was worse, otherwise I would have given it only one star.  I could have purchased a unit a Circuit City or BestBuy and been better off
I bought a sweatshirt from them--the tote was a "freebie" and too small for much use anyway. ---  --- Customer service was awful. They sent me the wrong size--a man's size, not the woman's I was searching for (and the photo had a woman wearing it!  She must have been an Amazon).  I returned it the next day and they REFUSED to accept the return, saying it looked worn
This is one of the only things I have every bought sight unseen on Amazon.  This canopy is very well made and a breeze to set up and put away.  The carrying case on wheels is an extra bonus
The suction cups were bent and just did not stick to the high chair or anything else for that matter.  My 6 month old daughter just likes to play with the animals - they crinkle and delight her. 
I gave this pedometer one star because it is not for anyone who wants to use it straight off of the shelf.  This pedometer can work if you do not mind working on it.  It has problems that need modification.   ---  --- The top of the clip on this pedometer pushes against the body, making the vertical angle 20 degrees or more off of plumb.  That means the weighted arm inside drags on the circuit board and does not move freely.  Remove the factory clip and the tabs that hold it.  Add some adhesive Velchro to the back of the case.  Make a fabric band for your ankle.  Attach the ends to each other with Velchro.  Put a strip of Velchro on the outside of the band for attaching the pedometer to the band.  I get  accurate readings with this pedometer when it is attached to the inside of my right ankle.  I got inconsistent readings with it on my waistline.    ---  --- The hair spring that returns the weighted arm to its upright position weakened considerably after about ten miles and the pedometer drastically undercounted.  I opened the pedometer and added a strut to brace the spring.  The strut is made of thin brass.  Aluminum from a soda can would work, too.  I made a "V" in one end of the strut to hold the spring.  I pushed lightly against the spring from the left side, drilled a hole in the brass, and anchored the strut to a screw on the lower left part of the circuit board.  The strut angles up just slightly from the screw that anchors it.  I now have quite a few miles on the pedometer.  (I have a theory the spring weakened because its solder joint to the circuit board may have broken slightly and allowed the spring to twist freely.) ---  --- Several times the pedometer reset itself to "0" for no apparent reason.  I know nothing pushed on the reset button.  One incident was while it was going through the scanner at airport security.  Once it reset while I was walking.  Twice it reset while I was napping on the sofa.  I am thinking a charge of static electricity overwhelmed the circuit, but I do not know.  Static electricity from too many synthetic fabrics can be a problem with more expensive pedometers, too.   ---  --- This pedometer uses a counter circuit.  If someone needs an inexpensive electronic counter, connect a wire to the weighted arm and another wire to the coiled spring it contacts.  Connect a button switch to the two wires.  Freeze the weighted arm in place with hot glue
The original battery never lasted an entire day if I talked very much.  With this replacement battery, I never run out of power anymore.  I do charge it every night. The battery is a little bit thicker than the OEM but it causes no problems when carrying it on the belt clip.  The new battery comes with a new battery door that matches and fits perfectly
Very  Satisfied easy to load and very easy to use.I started using it as soon as I loaded it with out reading the help or tutorial. I really like the ease of use and the quality of the invoices it produced. I had Quick books a few years ago and the new one is much more user friendly. I highly recomend this program for anyone running a small Business
This book has too many errors. There is nothing more frustrating than to follow the steps outlined and find out it does not work because they did not Q&A the examples. ---  --- ie. They ask you to select a field from the table, but the field does not exist. The stored procedure does not include it. ---  --- You would have to know how to write SQL to correct this
Item is exactly as pictured/described.  Cute design and good quality.  Adds a nice touch.  Highly recommend
I compared several headphones and found these to be the best by far at such a good price.  I recommend them to people who like quality listening.  I use them with my iPod and my computer
This is a beautiful piece. Very substantial and unusual! The only thing that would have made it better is if it had been made with a bigger bail so it could accommodate larger chains than the neckwire it comes on. Regardless, it was well worth the price
Relationships and drug use are major themes.  This album starts off with two absolute killer tunes, lets down some but has a joy thoughout.  I can't believe this is going to be his only album.....what a shame.  From someone who has been listening to rock for a long time, I tell ya, this is a blast.  Pure fun.  Something you might want to give to someone you have broken up with as its full of a broken heart and the joy of being in love.....mostly rather quickly paced.  One of my favorite albums of the 90s.  More people should listen
This thermometer is terrific. It works quickly and the handle is long enough that you don't burn yourself on the heat from the coals. I highly recommend this product
OMG!! This is Relient Ks best CD yet. You should buy it, even if you didn't care for their other CDs. Because....well...it ROCKS!!
I am married to a native New Yorker and we spent an entire weekend looking over this book and talking about many of the wonderful places it mentions, many of which we still visit today. As an extra bonus for avid cooks, there are recipes. For anyone who remembers Luchows or any of the other venerable, now closed restaurants the book mentions, it will take you back to happy times and good memories. It's an excellent book and clearly Schwartz has poured a great deal of research into what is his labor of love.

This is the first time I have subscribed to this magazine.  I really like the article topics but wish that there was more data included to back the articles. 
This is a nice compact hardback edition of Dashiell Hammett's five novels, which he wrote between 1929 and 1934. A veteran of Pinkerton detective agency in several cities, Hammett turned his intimate familiarity with crooks, low-lives, and the seedier side of life into hard-boiled, hard-hitting detective stories. This was a time when urban corruption was the rule, and private detectives, journalists, and police officers shared information. Two of these novels, "The Maltese Falcon" and "The Glass Key" are American classics. Another, "The Thin Man", inspired one of Hollywood's best-loved movie franchises. Hammett's novels lift the veil of propriety from the subcultures in which they take place, laying bare violence, corruption, and pervasive cynicism. But they're not dreary. The sharp prose crackles, and the heroes stand apart from the corruption while swimming in it, steadfast in their own codes of conduct, their iconoclastic ideologies rooted securely in realism. These five novels all appeared as serials in magazines prior to being published as novels. "The Thin Man" appeared first in "Redbook", the others in "Black Mask". ---   ---  "The Maltese Falcon" (1930) and "The Glass Key" (1931) are flawless. "The Maltese Falcon" features private detective Sam Spade, a irresistible femme fatale, and the ruthless pursuit of an ancient gold statuette. The last pages of the book are some of the most hard-hitting and cynical in all of noir fiction. And they're brilliant. "The Glass Key" explores political corruption that leads to personal tragedy in an unnamed American city. Oddly, the detective is the right-hand man of a crime boss. "Red Harvest" (1929) features the adventures of Hammett's most popular detective, the Continental Op, in a town called Personville, or Poisonville to those who know it better. The always unnamed detective for the Continental Detective Agency finds himself responsible for cleaning up a mining town that is ruled by violence and mob warfare. The novel's opening paragraph deserves to be read several times. "The Thin Man" (1934) is an attempt at humor among New York's blue-blooded, cold-blooded upper crust. Hard-boiled humor is interesting in concept. But I find the characters in this novel more pitiful than funny, and Hammett's style was in decline at this point. At least his characteristic cynicism wasn't. "The Dain Curse" (1929) is another Continental Op novel. This one is melodramatic, absurd, and not up to Hammett's usual standards. Hammett fans shouldn't miss it, but others may find it pointless. I described the novels in order of descending quality. "Complete Novels" organizes them chronologically. ---   ---  Five novels is a lot to pack into one book. But "Complete Novels" doesn't resemble a door stop. It's a handy size actually. The print is not too small, but the pages are quite thin. Editor Stanley Marcus, a literary critic and frequent admirer of Hammett's work, has included a Chronology of Hammett's life and several pages of notes on the novels in the back of the book. The chronology is informative and provides all of the apparently significant events in Hammett's life. The notes are mostly definitions of colloquialisms used in the novels, which are useful. The notes also contain an introduction to "The Maltese Falcon", written by Hammett in 1934, in which he explains the origins of that novel's characters. It's quite interesting. For those who prefer to own these novels separately, Vintage Crime/Black Lizard hs published some handsome trade paperback editions. But if you want hardback and don't mind all five novels in one volume, this is quite a nice book
When I first started reading this magazine back in 2003 I thought "Oooh what a cool mag!!" But clearly I was totally wrong. Since 2003 Seventeen has changed  from a girly sophisticated mag appealing to girls just barely in their teens to to a cheap,overated, cliche`, piece of crap!!! I'd like to know what happened!!!!! It's super boring now. It has no style. All the sections are about health garbage & boring global trash. HELLO? What about the stars, movies,.. the music section sucks! Nothing is good anymore! If you disagree with me your probably just as boring as it yourself. I hate it and I DO NOT recomend this magazine. Don't read it!! You'll be wasting your time
Wowzers! ---  --- I am a 26 year old male with skin from the devil. It's so oily that only two minutes out of the shower my nose is already greasy. I have been using Fresh Farmacy 1x or 2x daily for the past two months or so and have been thouroughly impressed. A week ago I bought a bar of Coalface out of curiosity. I had read about it on the LUSH website and was somewhat skeptical. I was told at the store that Fresh Farmacy would be the better bet for my kind of skin, and I figured the slightly higher pricetag on the FF meant that it was better than Coalface. Now, having used Coalface for the past week, I can say for sure that my skin feels cleaner and tighter with Coalface than it generally has with FF. ---  --- I'm not about to toss out my remaining FF of course! It lasts forever and I probably have another 6 or 7 months of it left. I find it to be a great skin cleanser. So far, though, I think Coalface is the better choice for me. ---  --- Give this stuff a try
I still have not received this item, not sure what is going on ?  If you have any answers I would love to hear about it?  Thank
I was trying to make the shift from a razor blade to an electric shaver and found that this shaver did not provide the close shave I was looking for.  It also was taking me much longer to shave because I had to continually go over the same area in order for it to finally get all the hairs.  In the end, after using it for 5 weeks, I took advantage of the 60 day return policy and returned the shaver.  I am back to my razor blade.  I still hate shaving
I have had a Weber Silver B grill for several years.  I have found that the igniter works for about two years, then just does has to be replaced.  This is an easy replacement, and is not expensive.  This ignighter works as well as any I have seen, and I think the minor cost and inconvenience of replacing the ignighter is offset by the quality of the grill.
I have yet to read a true Grisham thriller, but I plan to in the near future.  Having said that, I have no idea how this compares, but I didn't really care for it.  It's cute and has a sort of slapstick humor that I couldn't get into.  I felt like I was reading a teen or children's book, and I don't like feeling so patronized when I read unless I knowingly pick up a picture book ready for the simplicity of a good message--even then, I don't usually feel patronized or "written down to".  It's simple writing and a simple plot.  It's lighthearted and thus a light read.  I imagine many people would enjoy it; I just couldn't get into it.  :o
Like the Fresh Farmacy, I bought this soap based on the reviews and ended up giving it to a friend at work.  Don't get me wrong, I love most of Lush's products and, to my husbands chagrin, end up spending a lot of money on their online products but when I got this particular soap I just couldn't get into it.  I admit that it smelled a bit better after showering with it for the first time but still found myself reaching for my "Sexy Peel" over this stuff.  I ended up giving it to a friend that I work with but only after it had been passed over my three other girls in my office...I'm just not getting the "heavenly scent" that this item was described as having in previous reviews
This stuff smells bad, like a mix of medicine and pesticide.  Had to throw it out
size 9.5 fit like it was an 8. I wear a 9 typically and could barely get my foot in, and was unable to walk in them at all without pain. I've bought Steve Madden before many times and know they run slightly small, but this pair was ridiculously small and I suspect perhaps mis-labeled
This is a great and comfortable bra, and it works for me. It's a MINIMIZER, and is great for larger sizes. I exercise a lot and it provides great support, even good enough for running on the treadmill. I have a few of these same bras that have lasted several years. I am so impressed with them that I looked up the tag numbers on the bras and found this site to purchase more, and it is half of what I paid in the mall. Now it is all I wear for everyday :)
This is an awesome little camera.  Except that you can't use it at night!  There are horrible white spots in nighttime photos when the flash is used.  Apparently these appear because the flash is SO close to the lens in this camera, and so dust reflects badly.  It's a known problem [...] ---  --- Also, it's totally annoying that Sony uses all their proprietary technology.  As a result, the cable for connecting this camera to the computer is unwieldly (uhh, have you heard of USB??!!), and you have to buy a sony Memory Stick, which probably won't work with anything else you have.  On the flipside, you can take movies that aren't limited to 30 seconds with this guy - i think that might be a result of the memory stick technology. ---  --- But other than that, the design and operation of this little guy seems pretty slick.  The lens is not one of those that pops out, so not sure if that affects image quality at all, but as far as I could tell, quality was good. ---  --- In the end, what good is a camera that can't take usable pictures with its flash??
This piece of equipment worked really well as far as juicing up the battery when it's dead, and it's really easy to charge and use. Problem is, after I had used it a couple times, the cheapo plastic clamps BOTH SNAPPED. Now they can't grip on the battery terminals. Under warranty, but so expensive to ship (shipping not covered by warranty) that it isn't worth it. Great idea, shoddy construction. ALL VECTOR have these same plastic clamps, so try to find one with metal clamps.
I love this key and cell phone set so much I'm buying another one for a friend.  I looked into the the recall and found that these keys were not part of the recall.  My 3 year old loves the recording feature on the cell phone.  (Actually even my older kids think it's pretty neat.)  Great product.. great price
I loved the idea of the electric heating. The "ease" of temperature control, etc... but the heating element melted. The plastic part of it did anyway... right where it conects to the metal bent "rod" that creates the heat to burn the wood chips. ---  --- It also was a pain to constantly snug the wood chips (even tried the chunk type woods) against the heating element. Which ment I had to balance the housing, the water bowl, etc. just to get where the heating element was at. ---  --- I don't know about other electric smokers, but this on "stank". ---  --- Just get one with a smoker box on the side... toss in some coals, wood... whatever... as needed. Don't try to make the unit too "scientific"
I'm going to be completely honest with you. I hated the HP camera's because 1. does not take great pictures at night 2. digital zoom is not great either 3. blur's out if you do not stand still taking the picture. I've had an old HP camera and I have had this newer HP camera and they are all the same. It doesnt seem like it really matters what MP they are. Still bur's out and it is disappointing. I guess it really depends on the person about this camera but I'd rather have a Sony, Samsung, or some other company's item. =
DO NOT buy the case Canon sells for this camera. It takes 20 seconds to take the camera out or put it in
This is what I use when I want to knit something for myself.  The patterns are hip and young and they always feature the latest greatest designers.  This is also much more about fashion than any other knitting magazine out there- lots of runway pictures and rail-thin models posing knitwear in exotic locations.  I find that each issue has a good mix of projects of varying skill levels.  I have knitted several and I'm happy with the instructions and I've never run across any major pattern mistakes.  I find that the exact yarns, however, can be hard to find.  They usually give you enough information about the yarn and desired effect so that you can easily substitute.  While I'm careful not to pick patterns that won't be embarrasing to wear next year, they do have a lot of hyper-trendy patterns.  It would be a pity to waste all that time and money on something that would be decidedly "out" by the time you finsih it.  
You might have to pay a little bit more but the reliability offered by OEM products gives one much peace of mind. I am always willing to wait a little longer and pay a little more if I know what I am getting is not just a counterfeit. I think I got my money's worth
I love this magazine and have just ordered a subscription for my daughter too.  Very good value for the money
I ordered these Lorna Doone 100 calorie cookies from amazon because they can not keep them on the shelves at any grocery store around my area. I even called a friend 45 miles away and he couldnt find them either. You should try them. They taste great without the extra junk in them.  My kids love them 2 :)
I love Orville Redenbacher's Sweet & Buttery there is no other popcorn like it I'm a little upset because they took it off the self in Jersey City, If I can't find it i will buy Kettle Corn second best
Do not buy this DVD as it is a total waste of money,Joe Walsh can --- be heard on a much better DVD with Eagles Farewell 1 Melbourne,Au. This DVD DOES NOT have DTS 5.1 Audio format as advertised
This product gives your hair great volume without looking greasy.(Be careful not to use too much!) It works best if you have a little time to diffuse your hair with a blow dryer! Not surprisingly, when I use curl conscious many people will compliment the curls and the depth it adds to my hair :)I wish it would combat frizz a little more, but my hair is less frizzy when I use it. I guess the next thing I'll try is the Bumble and Bumble Frizz Fighter
This fills me up and it tastes very good, I only with the box was bigger, I can only get 2 bowls per box
As gifted a story teller as he is a veterinarian, James Herriot has the rare ability to bring out every emotion known to the human race with a single magical flick of his pen. Every Living Thing is without a doubt one of the crowning achievements of a master, and is possessed by a single, true trait that is difficult to find in many commercial books- every single tale is told straight from the heart. You will never fail to laugh at the hilarious tales and cry at the most poignant moments. If you're an animal lover, or even just have a passing interest in animals, this is a book you will hold on to and re-read until the end of your days. Kudos, James Herriot, you are very much missed
I am still under the free 3 month trial period and love it.  I will buy it because it doesn't eat my memory and I feel safe with the people who designed the operating system. --- I reccomend
This is one heavy duty cast iron pot! Very heavyweight. The lid holds a good seal to the pot. My only wish is that it came preseasoned. I sure made a smoke filled room occur. And of course, once was not enough to season, so I had to do it again. But overall, great pot
I love this old documentary...Capt Clark Gable does an excellent job narrating it, the color footage is a rare treat, and it gives an excellent insight into the day-to-day lives of those from the greatest generation.  It is a real tribute to all the men who flew bombers in WWII and we need to remember their service and sacrifices.  They fought a tougher war and sustained much greater losses than we have in Iraq or Afghanistan, plus they were gone for much longer periods and didn't have the technology such as email or video teleconferencing to keep in touch with their loved ones.  We need to remember them, as we are losing them quickly and soon they may all be gone.  But their legacy remains, and it is films like this one that preserves it
I still got a pantyline with this---strange and frustrating---- --- :
Don't waste your money.  This album is cheesy, sounds like a million other pop rock songs, and is nothing compared to their earlier work.  With Donnie Van Zant and Max Carl on vocals, all I have to say is:  they need the old  lead singer back!  The guitar work is ok, but the classic .38 Special sound  has definitely been lost
This is a quality sweatshirt that I am enjoying wearing during the cold winter weather. I have had trouble, in the past , with other brands with the arms being too short or the body length being too short but that is not the case with this product . The only problem with the product is that it could stand to have more elastic at the bottom but this is a minor problem . The service was excellent and I will return for more BEARS gear
I have purchased both the Home & Gardens interior and the Punch interior software. Home & Gardens is much easier to use. You can really start without reading much of the manual. Punch demands that you read the manual (342 pages). It is not intuative. But Punch can do so much more and has so much more creativity. IE: Punch has a library of trees, shrubs and flowers for your yard. Home & Gardens only have potted plants, nothing you can use to landscape. Punch also allows you to make custom doors or windows to your exact specifications. H&G doesn't. You have to choose a set style of door or window and change options.I also could place digital photos of my backyard behind my "house" on Punch to make it more realisitic. I like both software programs, but Punch has more options, but you have to do your homework first
This product was terrible.  First and foremost this seat did NOT fit on American Airlines Business Class seats!  Secondly, the rear facing car seat tilts so far forward that your baby is falling forward agains the harness and if they fall asleep their face is pressing against the seat belt.  The wheel covers fell off the first time I used it.  The stroller is a piece of junk.  When I called the company to explain my problems they never even called me back, so on top of it all they have a horrible product and terribel customer service to match.  Do not buy
Its the best table out there. I did a lot of research and now have a year of "testing." We bought it for my daughter when she was 1, and she's almost 3. I also run a daycare. The chairs don't tip and various ages from 2-5 have put them to their worst. It cleans easily and is easy to put aside, if needed. I did have to replace a chair once (I stood on it.) and the customer service was fast and friendly.
We LoVe this game. We were first introduced to it at our children's preschool where it fast became a favorite at "free choice time". The children engaged in it delightfully and playfully. Everyone has fun. The game board is durable and can be constructed differently over and over again -- this works out so great because with all the repeated play ours gets the kids are not memorizing the spot the item was. I worried a little that it might be too competitive and those that were "better" at it might leave those not as quick at hunting feeling discouraged, BUT have not ever found that to be the case when we have the game out at home or at the school. The board is brightly colored the items are fascinatingly fun to search for. It is a challenge even for us BIG kids. I would recommend it highly for a fun family activity game
This Vitamin E moisture cream has a great soft rosey smell, and feels great on my skin. I was given a sample which I took home and tried, and I was blown away by this product. I went back to our local mall a few days later and purchased the product. I love it
I can't believe that other reviewers are calling the moves in this video "easy to master".  I found some of them to be nearly impossible to follow.  The camara barely focuses on her feet as she perfoms intricate latin dance footwork!  I am an athletic twenty-three year old girl who is not a slow learner.  I just excercised with this DVD for the first time and it was really tough!  I didn't get a work out at all because I was scratching my head and rewinding the thing so much.  She doesn't break down the moves at all and it's just so much more confusing than it needs to be.  The dances are cute, but it's frustrating that she doesn't explain the moves.  I hope no one else has to waste their money on this stupid thing
It was an excellent purchase. Fast ans efficient receipt of goods and fine quality
This is the third DVD from Shawn Trautman that I have gotten (Swing and Cha-Cha are the others), and they are all exceedingly well done.  They start from ground zero and progress in very small steps that are a snap to follow.  By the time it's over, you will understand the logic behind the dance and know enough to do well on a social dance floor.  It will also get you pumped to learned more advanced steps; you won't feel intimidated.  I highly recommend it
It is ok for small dogs, large dogs will knock it down
The material is too stiff and forces the  pick too far out from my finger. It is also  more  'stiff' than a dunlop .60m
This is a really great scent, but it could of been better. I think it misses that extra zing you get when you test it on animals.  I mean seriously, animals want to smell nice too
This was sent to my daughter and son-in-law as a thank you present for a recent visit. I had noticed numerous bottles on the floor of their shower and thought it would be a great way to neaten it up.  They love it!!! Not only does it get rid of the clutter and make it easier to dispense soap, shampoo,etc., my son-in-law can now shave in the shower and keep his shaving paraphernalia there as well
This is a well engineered product; I cannot call it a toy because it is much much more than that. After building just one of the sample setups I was able to put down the manual and start creatively designing and building my own. My daughter (3.5 years old) loves it. She really likes placing a marble on the run when I tell her its time to "test it", and I let her identify the error. The only marbles that have fallen off the track are due to construction errors by myself. After 1 day (and several of our own setups) we already find ourselves wanting more pieces. I suggest buying the largest set from the get go if you have an engineering type mind or just enjoy puzzles. Nice feature to note : the coloring of the blocks is logical; each color has its own unique function(s).
I experienced what seemed to be a common problem for many people that have purchased av cables for the ipod. I was able to get the audio but no picture was available despite following the advice of other reviewers to set my TV out signal to on. It didn't help that no manual was included in the box to assist with troubleshooting.
I am a first time expectant mother and like most excited moms-to-be, I read pretty much all of the reviews on every item I need to register for or buy for baby. However, the helpful hint I have to give comes from my other half who already has a son and has used a wipe warmer. He said the wipe warmers that heat from the bottom up (heat ALL of the wipes) are a waste of money because by the time you get to the bottom wipes....they are dried out from being continuously reheated. They basically lose their moisture which defeats the purpose of a wipe in the first place and you end up throwing a bunch of them out without the benefit of using them first. We opted to go with this one because it seems to be smaller (more convenient for travel which we will do a fair amount of) and it heats just the first few wipes which is usually all you need for a diaper change. Some mothers would say this is not really a necessary thing to have (after all, babies lived through diaper use just fine before these things were invented), but because our baby will be born during the winter, I thought this would have more use for us. I gave this product four stars because we haven't tried it yet....but just wanted to pass that helpful hint along to other mothers who are interested in practicality and saving money and hopefully not losing quality in the process
I liked this tub at first.  The size was nice, and the sling was comfortable and good support for my preemie newborn.  After about a month of use, though, there was a horrible odor emitting from the mesh sling.  This was after "squeezing" it out as best I could and propping it up to dry after every use.  The sling is not machine washable and therefore unusable after it gets ruined by mold.  --- I stopped using the sprayer after the first couple days.  It was just too much of a pain to fill it up everytime, especially since it doesn't even spray well.  The other reviewers are correct in saying that the button on the sprayer is difficult to press.  Especially when your hands are wet and slippery. --- It's a good thing BRU will take back anything!  I am off to return it and purchase the old faithful cheapie tub
I'm not usually a ballet person.  I haven't seen anything since "The Nutcracker" when I was six.  But this was absolutely brilliant.  The concept for it is completely bold and original and Adam Cooper as The Swan blew me away.  How can you beat a dancer in black leather pants with a riding crop?  Tchaikovsky never would have envisioned this, but he would be utterly thrilled to see what they have done with his epic ballet. 
Got this for my father.  He loves it.  Great coverage.  Easy to use
... but it`s coldly made without much heart. Time and time again, readers have been overwhelmed by the old publicity "Garbo the great actress", "The Sphinx", "The Greatest Star"...  ---  --- Oh I could go on forever... However, boiled down to the essentials, she had a charismatic, photogenic face, BUT SHE NEVER DEPENDED ON PROMOTING HERSELF: MGM and fellow artists and critics sang their rhapsodies and privately I suspect she overdosed quickly of the SuperStar-label and became bored with the whole idea. I think she felt she was overpraised much too early in her career and felt embarassed by the never-ending attention.  ---  --- In Queen Christina she is beautifully lit and photographed(and from 1927 on - she was filmed behind closed curtains...with only William Daniels and Karl Freund close at hand)... ---  --- I would say that many an actress with that attention could have easily have filled her shoes. She was a timid actress. Cukor once observed that he felt she had to be thrown into the action - she never created. Seeing her with Constance Bennett in TWO-FACED WOMAN og Charles Boyer in CONQUEST, you`ll see that she can`t reach their standard in  scenes she is forced to act and interplay - and not merely pose and being brilliantly photographed in close-up. ---  --- In QUEEN CHRISTINA she is a MOVIESTAR, not an actress...  ---  --- So who would I define the ultimate star of the 20th century? ELIZABETH TAYLOR; for all her brilliant performances(and bad 1s), her legendary life and beauty...  Now, Miss Taylor is what A MOVIESTAR AND A GREAT MOVIEACTRESS is all about..
I could not find these slippers in our local stores.  I had two pair that were worn out and wanted exactly the same item.  I ordered them, they arrived and I love them.  It was a very easy, customer friendly process
  The Panasonic PV-GS500 was discontinued in late 2006 in anticipation of Panasonic's new 2007 models which will be available in the Spring. ---  ---   The PV-GS500 is compact, delivers stunning video in moderate lighting and above, has a lot of features that will appeal to the aspiring pro-sumer videographer. It lacks an audio output jack, which many will fault it for. It does have a separate microphone jack. The menu is driven by a toggle and is easy to use. ---  ---   It is reall aimed at the casual videographer who wants superb quality in a compact, uncomplicated package and it delivers precisely that. ---  ---   Low-light performance is poor, but there is an accessory shoe, so you can mount an auxillary light. I would suggest getting an accessory bracket that provides two or three accessory shoes so you can use both a shotgun microphone and an auxillary light for weddings, parties and other group events. ---  ---   Battery life is about what you would expect, so carrying one or two spare batteries is recommended. ---  ---   All in all, a very nice 3CCD camcorder for the advanced amateur or just someone who wants superb image quality in an easy-to-use package. ---  --- Jerr
I recived the paint quickly and it as in great condition. I only had 1 bad ball in the whole pack of 1000
I like this printer.  There a few minor quarks, but it's fast and the prints come out good.  The one thing to watch for is making sure the ink tape cartridge stays tight.  If it's lose it will start making bad prints.  It takes less than minute to pull the cartridge out, tighten it and start printing again. ---  --- I am also using this with the Mac OSX OS.  Though the device says it will only work with PC and mentions something about the CASIO CW Utility for use on a Mac, but no where on the Casio site could I find the mentioned Utility.    After some searching I cam e accross this: ---  --- [...] ---  --- This allows the CW-100 to work fine on a Mac.  Though I have never seen the  PC software that comes with printer, I have read that this mac version does not have all of the text formating options. This is enough to get around, since you can make a JPG version of your label, put that in the print area and print away.  The JPG can be what ever image/text you want.  Resolution is great too.  I print at 300dpi. ---  --- All in all, I found this to be a great purchase.  I make music and do not have the money to send out to have my CDs done.  This print has more than paid for itself by allowing me to make professional looking cds and very little cost.  Great the DIYer
Highly recommed this grill cover.  The appearance/style is classy with it's subtle colors that work well on the backyard patio.  And it is SOOO durable!  I'm sure it will last for years.  No more ugly black vinyl covers that you punch holes in the first time you try to drape them over the grill.  I'll never use anything else besides this Artisan Grill Cover now!!
This printer has been a piece of garbage since the day I bought it. I don't know why I kept trying, as the purchase was made about a year ago. It should have been thrown it in the trash long ago and I would have cut my losses (instead I did buy one more package of paper and ink. Mistake.) I have never gotten more than one picture in a row without an error message, turning the printer off, turning it back on, doing that several times, and finally maybe getting it to print two pictures in the same day.  ---  --- Now it says the cartridge should be replaced, when about 20 minutes earlier it told me there were approximately 56 pictures left in the cartridge (and I have not printed anywhere near 44 pictures, which would add up to the claim of 100 per cartridge. I have printed about 6.)  ---  --- The ironic thing is, the handful of pictures that have printed correctly have been beautiful. The one that I printed today was perfect. But several tries to print one more picture were a waste of about two hours. This is the last time I try to use the printer, it is finally going in the trash
I purchase this by the picture inside it shows little closet type places and a bar for hanging clothes, none if this is there, its cute but I would not recommand this procduct.  the picture of the inside is false. It's not even close.
This game is tons of fun!  My husband, children (ages 6 and 7) and I have had hours and hours of enjoyment from this game.  I definetely recommend that your children be able to read fluently to thoroughly enjoy the game.  This game is also great for informal parties, as an ice breaker. 
They are everything the other reviewers said they were, and I, too, can't wait until the printing is darker and in color!  Wish it didn't take so long to print and hope the darker images and color only require an upgrade
when i first got this mp3 and opened up the box i was surprised how small it is.  about the size of a piece of chewing gum.  i installed the program via the included cd and it worked right away with no problem what so ever.  this held all the music i had on my lap top with lots of room to spare.  the program is easy to use and downloading music to the player is fast and easy.  the sound is outstanding with the ear-bud headphones that are included.  the fm works well and the display is back-light and very easy to read. all of the players options are user friendly and do not require a lot of skill to use.  this is one piece of electronics that will not drive you mad with hard to use software or directions.  as an added bonus they included batteries.  this is one of my favorite gadgets and i would recommend the 1 gig for any user.  it is not expensive at all and really who needs more music than this holds
I was so excited to receive my first issue of Art In America, and I was severly disappointed to see that it is mostly full-page ads for galleries in Europe.  There are very few articles or artist Bios.  The photos are beautiful, but don't get this if you were hoping to learn anything about American artists or galleries
Not sure what all the fuss is regarding assembly.  I just unpacked and assembled it a few minutes ago with no trouble.  Assemble is probably too strong a word, there is no actual assembly or tools involved.  As for the weight, maybe 15 pounds, certainly nowhere near 50.   ---  --- The instructions seemed sufficient although I didn't really need to use them.    ---  --- Basically, if the fear of difficult assembly reported here is your only concern, don't let that stand in the way of choosing this item.   --- 
This is Ann Waldron's best McLeod Dulaney mystery yet. The characters are so lively and well-drawn they literally walk right off the page (and, in some cases, right into your heart). The setting--the Princeton Theological Seminary--is perfect (a perfect place for a murder, that is), and the plot is downright diabolical. Are you in the mood for some humorous, mysterious and sinfully well-written fun? Then do yourself a favor and read this delightful book
This is the one & only cooking/food magazine to buy.  Not only does it share fabulous recipes that are tested in the magazine's test kitchens, it also illustrates step-by-step instruction, rates cooking tools & gadgets, & educates the reader on seasonal ingredients
my wife was surely surprised when she rec'd this gift now that she is in a retail lsdies shop. To dress up and add pearls looks fantastic. thanks well worth the price
I like the stop watch functions that this watch has.  I also like the seperate dials for the different timekeeping functions.  Unfortunately, this watch is hard to read in bright light. Such as sunlight and well lit spaces.  Overall though, I like this watch because it looks good.  Well, it looks good on me anyway
The product shown does not match the description.  It is NOT the Marble Roller Coaster Kit. Please fix
I was very unhappy with this product because the paint is chipping off the wood side-boards which is very dangerous for kids.  I was wondering if there was it possible for me to get new side boards for my grandson's wagon which I purchased for his 2nd birthday.  He is unable to play with the wagon because of the paint chipping off
I loved this book. The food was really good and fast (which is good because I have a very packed schedule). Also great if you're on a budget. The recipes have variations so I could eat different things but not have to buy a whole new set of ingrediants. ---  --- The only reason it didn't get five stars was because some of the food was really spicy (I'm from Texas, I like spicy), to the point my boyfriend couldn't eat it. I just modified the recipes and everything was fine
My wife has been looking for a pair of seamed pantyhose and didn't think such a thing existed. Last week she wore this pair to a re-enactment and received many favorable comments. Highly recommende
I bought this from Northern Tool for $9.00 and found a much better product than I expected. The 75 watt bulb in my door opener powers the Solar cell without a problem, guess Andrew got a defective unit or is trying to use this with the light guard over the bulb, It must be in direct view of the bulb. The laser points to a spot on my dash allowing for perfect parking every time.
There are buttered-up popcorn movies that entertain you, score a ticket to "Jurassic Park" and Spielberg for that, and there are films with gravitas, that move you, disturb you, drag you to the altar kicking and screaming, to consider circumstances you might not brave yourself.."Badlands," Terrence Malick's 1973 directorial debut, an overlooked jewel of a film, forcibly moves you, and takes an unsavory subject, the Charles Starkweather serial killings' crime spree, up in the vacated Badlands of South Dakota, and refines it til you posit, "How did we get here as a country? What went wrong?"..And then you appraise the challenges a film-maker overcomes to project the psychopathic wrath of two teenagers (Martin Sheen as Kit Carruthers, Sissy Spacek as Holly Sargis) on a thrill-killing "honeymoon", onto the silver screen and make it empathetic, palatable..Why would anyone care in the first place about two low-life, lost highway delinquents, who shoot a parent, assume they can get away consequence-free, and move on with their careless lives like nothing more infractious than cutting an afternoon civics class has occurred?..However, "Badlands" is rooted in unfortunate fact, these inexplicable events happened to a pedestrian populace in North America, and Malick lets you tag along in this teenage angst riddled odyssey, deeper and deadlier into an American wasteland..The film is palpable evil genuis, arguably a top ten American film classic, irrespective it was shot by a first time director, with an unknown cast.."Badlands" resonates with gritty authenticity, cinematic style, fierce inhumanity, and the most haunting musical score (Erik Satie's Gymnopedies 3) that underwrites a Sissy Spacek voice over narration, spoken in a lazy monotone like a detached schoolgirl explaining away her unexcused absence in the principal's office, when in fact Holly (Sissy Spacek) is the fractured other half of the Kit Carruthers' killing machine, a bossom buddy in crime..Some films are purposefully pure entertainment, escapist faire.."Badlands" on the other hand is rare art, belongs in a museum
I used to love this magazine.  It still has some excellent articles, but it is true that there are way too many filler issues now with top 100 lists of things I have no interest in (resort hotels, spas, expensive travel agents).  However, on the flip side, it never talks down to the reader - the audience is assumed to be well travelled and somewhat sophisticated - which I appreciate.  I checked out Nat Geographic Traveller hoping it would be like the CN Traveller of old, but although it has nicer photography (with few gratuitously scantily clad female shots), it seemed much more mainstream - like I had already done many of the "dream trips" befor I hit my 30s and the information also seemed much shallower.  I like Geo, but I struggle through the French and it's a lot more expensive
The is one of the fastest and easiest to learn games I have ever played.  The first time we played was on Christmas Day.  We had 10 players that ranged from 16 years to 77 years and everyone loved it.  We played for over 3 hours and decided we had to stop to eat.  It is also a great way to break the ice.  I would recommend this game to anyone whether you are a big game player or a beginner, this game can't be beat
Do yourself a favor and read the book and dont even look at this movie
I'm very happy to have discovered these & will definitely continue to use them in baking, it helps me cut back on the semi-sweet choc morsels with a healthier alternative.  ---  --- As far as eating them raw - I don't recommend it at all!!! Very bitter taste raw. Maybe some would enjoy it, but I would venture a guess that it's a minority of people rather than a majority
Received my moive as quickly as promised and have had no problems
The program works fine on Windows XP and is easy to use. It lets you print cards of many sizes. The big disappointment is in the number of cards that comes with the program. The back of the box claims "4500+ Cards and Sentiments, Celebrate life's special moments with cards for all occasions". That's nice. The problem with that is that I counted the total number of cards that come with the program.  It only adds up to 1045! So where are the other 3450+ cards and sentiments? Are you supposed to design them yourself? I just don't know. And certainly "cards for all occasions" means just that, doesn't it?  Well there's lots of birthday cards and plenty of holiday cards but not one sympathy card of any kind. I guess you just need to buy those on your own
I was expecting to see a decent film by Bava, but after having seen about 5 of his films, I can only guess that is he is a very good stylist but he lacks the capability to engage us with a story or to even scare us. Most of his films are gorgeous to behold but they are vapid and have no story, this film is just like all the rest.  ---  --- There is no point to any of it, there is no plot and hardly any suspense, suffice it to say it might be interesting for a 12 year old horror goof but to an adult, its quite tedious. Chris Lee is rather banal also, he doesn't do much and it seems that he dubbed his own voice in the studio, most of the cast is rather dull also, supposedly playing some ancient noble family, they look more like 1960's mop heads and morons who were on too much acid. The dialogue, what there is, is crude, probably written by a drunk Italian because there are so many mistakes, one example was when Lee was whipping the lady on the beach and she says, "I can't have more ice cream!"  ---  --- So, I would suggest renting "Planet of the Vampires" because that is more enjoyable than this waste. Interesting character to note was "Lesmo", dubbed as the "European Peter Lorre" who doesn't have much in the way of presence or acting skills and he looks like a cross between a frog and a midget.  --- 
This 10-20mm lens is equivalent to a 15-30mm in a 35mm film camera, so it's an ultra-wide lens at 10mm. I was pleasantly surprised at how sharp the images are from this lens; and it's rectilinear, which means that straight lines in real life remain straight in the photograph. It is a well-made lens, made with high-grade materials. What this lens excels at is when you want to photograph sweeping landscapes, close-quarters interior photography, and in architectural photography where you don't mind the exaggerated converging lines that an ultrawide produces. Personally, that's what I like, so I'm very happy with this Sigma 10-20mm
WOW!! This is awesome.  You guys have everything!!! I ordered 20 for valentines day.  They serve as the lining of the valentines day baskets that I am donating to my local church.  After they dig into the delicious assortment of candies and fruit they can rejoice that they will find a fine fresh rabbit for stewing later that evening.  Now if I only had some taters...
This product is not what its cracked up be, if looking for a screen protector, look elsewhere.  I can use the cloth and clean my own screen which is great but the screen protector really makes the screen look bad.  Waste of $10 and customer service won't respond to my email, matter of fact, email to customer service didn't ever deliver
This gate is horrible to try to open and close... don't try to pinch pennies when it's your little one's safety and YOUR convenience at stake.  Buy the Configure Gate instead... you'll be glad you did.  It is well worth every penny... this one isn't worth a thing
This upgrade installed easily with my Photoshop 5.5.  No problems at all.  This is an excellent program and leap years ahead of my Photoshop 5.5.  This is a much less expensive way to upgrade to cs2..rather than purchasing CS2 outright. ---  --- Be sure to get the updates after you install the program. --- 
American Heritage is a fine magazine brought to us by the same publishers who bring us Forbes Magazine. It is a magazine that examines history in all shapes and forms, examining past events and cultural changes that have shaped the American nation.  ---  --- One thing about this magazine that you will notice right away is that it is not just a magazine about American political history or the type of history that you remember from your school days. It does talk about this type of history, but it also includes stories about music, art, and other topics, breaking them apart and explaining how and why things happened the way they did and how they compare to the present. It also points out facts from the past that are more obscure, making for some very stimulating reading.  ---  --- Current events are also covered in this magazine, and in these instances, American Heritage discusses present- day phenomena from an intellectual and critical standpoint, often comparing it to similar events in the American past. This helps to keep the magazine current and more in- tune with important issues of the day.   ---  --- History buffs will love this magazine, and so will those of an intellectual persuasion. The articles here are more thoughtful than other magazines and many of them require greater concentration. For these reasons, American Heritage is not really a casual reading type of publication. It is intended for those who like to read, think, discuss, and debate. It's one of my favorite magazines of its kind on the market today.  --- 
I unfortunately wound up seeing this Christmas Misgiving on its original airing.  I have always been a fan of any Christmas special since Rudolph hit the air way back when. Each holiday season I hope for something to come along that has the potential to become the "New Rudolph".  This is so far away from that you would need the Hubble Space scope in order to see how close it came.  The imaging is excellent and has been executed with great expertise. Regrettably the story makes Santa vs. the Martins look like an Oscar contender.  Such a waste trying to make it more desirable by hoking it up with 3D gimmickry.  You can't improve on failure. After it aired on TV I didn't see it return in later years on regular TV. I didn't miss it then and was hoping to extend the pleasure indefinitely.  Can't win them all
i have read 208 pages and i am bored with this book. i don't think i can finish it
way to small of a cushion. had to purchase another one from a local store
We recently bought the same model dispenser, but in the satin finish.  From the first, only two of the three chambers were usable because the pumps didn't work (yes, we followed the instructions carefully).  Two months later, another pump has given out so only one chamber is usable.  Instead of this loser, try "The Dispenser 71450 Classic IV." We had one of these for years with never a problem and replaced it only because it was beginning to show its age. It's harder to fill than the AVIVA and not as pretty, but so what -- it works, and the AVIVA doesn't. 
DE LA PROLIFERACION DE BANDAS ANGLOPARLANTES DE LOS '70,NO ENCUENTRO MOTIVOS PARA DESTACAR ESTA PLACA....UNA MAS Y NADA MAS UE ESO..DESPUES DE TODO, ES MI HUMILDE OPINION....HUMM..HUMBLE PIE, DESCANSA TRANQUILO....
I haven't got this item because it is too expensive for what it gives. I have a Fujifilm E550 camera which cost is USD 250.00 by this date. This lens cost is USD 95.00 and it need a special adapter ring that cost extra USD 20.00. That means you will pay USD 365.00 for a 8x zoom camera. For that price or less you can get a +10x SLR like camera like the Fujifilm S5100 or S5200.
My mom says that coffee is bad for you and it makes your teeth yellow. Why would you want to teach your kid to drink coffee at the age of 3
As soon as I bought it I realized it doesn't hold the phone too well. Few days later my concerns proved them selves, every time I made a rapid movement or tried to run with it (even very carefully) the phone would unclamp itself from the holster and slam into the ground. Every time I was lucky to realize as soon as I droped it, untill today when after coming home from shoping I realized my z520a is no longer with me. There goes a $200 phone, lost because of a stupid $10 holster.  Do not buy this product, if you realy need a holster go with something like Sonyericsson's "ICE-26" that secures the phone with an extra flap on top so it dosn't slip out of the holster. As for me I gatta get me a new phone, shame I had the Z520 cell phone for about 4 months now and I really liked it
This was the best therapy game ever.  My girls bought it for me, a gift because I love board games.  We mostly played it with their friends.   I have played with my children several times and found out some very interesting views that they have about me.  I decided to bring it to a family gathering.  I have always been distant with my eight siblings.  The game started out with the kids and my sisters ect.  then when they saw I was ok with laughing at myself they asked the children to leave and just the sisters played.  We had a total awakening of how we see each other.  We have never been closer, since that game our communication has been wonderful.  This game is the best.  We laughed so hard we ached the next day.  We played till 2:00 a.m.  Our husbands kept calling us asking when we were going be home.  We started our game at 9:00 p.m. and told them we'd just be an hour or two. LOL  I have been instructed to bring the game to this Summers get-together
Ethan Mordden's editors have allowed him to ruin what could possibly have been a good book.  This is the worst of his books on the various decades of the Broadway musical as the faults of the seventies book have widened into gulfs.  His political ramblings (often just slightly right of Ann Coulter and making as much sense) seep through the book, dragging it down.  The French people are slammed a number of times, along with the ACLU, Burt Lancaster (apparently, according to Ethan a good friend of Stalin) and the left in general, while the author defends Bush (and it does take some looking back over the page to figure out how he fits all this into a book on musical theatre).  The author's train of thought wanders like a bitter old man  all over the page in search of a target, any target.  It is often hard to stomach.  The truly sad fact about this is that the author often has quite cogent things to say about a particular musical and when he does stick to that, it can actually make one want to look at the work again.  An editor should have cleaned the work up before before allowing it on stage to greet its public.  The author is capable of better work
This is Roxys last gasp...I mean "wheres Eddie Jobson??" Actually this really a good recording, its just that the first 5 Roxy Music albums were so flawlessly perfect that its hard to stand up against that level of perfection...anyway..with that said...I have NO IDEA why they took off the great rock version and put the disco-fluff version of Angel Eyes, which is hard to find on CD. This, to me is really the last Roxy Music Album, because you just CANT have Roxy Music without Paul Thompson...sorry. I mean Avalon and the others are nice pieces, but they really should have been Bryan Ferry solo albums because Andy and Phil are really playing more as session players there
Purchased these diapers(6/pack) and was blown awary at the cost. Took the advice of other reviews and purchased "premee" diapers.  Try to cut the cost and maybe other Moms and Grandmas will purchase your product
A lot of the online reviews say that this game is only half good, but it is my favorite game to play on the Wii.  Doing tricks and stunts with a truck is just a lot of fun.  And you get bonus points for ramming your opponents.   ---  --- If it were only like that on real roads..
I am not a right winger whatsoever, am against our involvement in the Mid East but did read this book. I can't say it better than Alan Dershowitz who commented about Chomsky's writing in general: many people buy his books and the page that is folded down is never greater than page 16
This is my favorite jazz album of all time.  Put simply, this was Miles Davis at his best.  The notes on this album simply float, and yet it flows together better than anything I've ever heard.  The composition is disorganized but in a way that it all makes complete sense.  Don't let the thirty second clips fool you.  I almost missed out on this because the clips are misleading.  I took a chance on it, and it was the best gamble I've ever made.  A must have for any jazz enthusiast
I'm ;logged in on my wife's accont. I never had problems with the band. I liked the first one so much that after I ran over it with my car, I ordered another. If you think of it as a throw away watch and keep it for two years, you'll love it. It has a very intuitive design, is lightweight and just works
His fragmentary thoughts are difficult to follow. There is some wisdom here and there, but not worth the headache you'll get trying to decipher what is going on in his head. Here is an example: --- "If you say your own name to yourself at such a moment, it will seem utterly alien. You will then understand the sacrament of baptism." Huh? ---  --- At first, I thought his writing may just be over my head, but after re-reading most of it, I realized it was just bad. It's like the whole book was written when he was high or something. Some very good ideas, but most can be found in other, better written books.
The mid-size is actually quite large.  Had I to do it over again, I would just get the original size because that would be sufficient.  I like a bit of sun but just not in my eyes!  I found that when wearing it in a boat with the wind at my face as we traveled, it stayed on very well.  That was a concern that I had since many visors flip off in heavy wind currents.  I did get a slight headache from it but not as bad as other visors.  The visor part seems to be a hard plastic with a light cloth material covering.  I chose purple and it is a beautiful shade.  The bows that go around your head are made of some soft comfortable material and they go farther around your head than other standard visors. 
Having been a fan of Antonia Fraser for many years, I highly anticipated her biography of Queen Marie-Antoinette, but have been very disappointed in that she often chooses the sensational over the factual. She depicts Marie-Antoinette's mother Empress Maria Theresa as heartless and calculating for sending her daughter to France at age 14 to get married, but arranged marriages were the norm; the empress was not doing anything out of the ordinary. What startled me most is that Fraser not only insists on Antoinette having an affair with Count Axel von Fersen, of which there is little concrete evidence, but goes onto maintain that Axel used condoms to keep the queen from getting pregnant. It seems to me that Marie-Antoinette loved children so much; she came from a family of sixteen where children were valued and her more liberal sister Caroline went on to have eleven children or more. She was also a devout Catholic and using such devices were unthinkable, unless one was a prostitute or dealing with prostitutes. In this case Fraser is applying the morals of some British aristocratic ladies to a queen of France. If Marie-Antoinette had been caught in adultery, it would have been considered treason; she would have been sent to a convent and had her children taken away from her. With all of her enemies at Court, that was not a risk she would have taken, if she had been so inclined. On a smaller scale, Fraser makes ridiculous assertions about Marie-Antoinette dyeing her hair - in all the pictures that I have seen of her, her hair looks grey from either powder or premature age; I have never read any first hand accounts of her dyeing it. Not that that is a big deal; but it makes me wonder where Lady Fraser's life ends and where Marie-Antoinette's life begins. I found it offensive that at the end Fraser interprets Marie-Antoinette's death as some kind of sacrifice for the cause of democracy, when she believed in monarchy and wanted her little son to be king. Especially, since Marie-Antoinette's murder was followed not by democracy but by dictatorships and Napoleon crowning himslf emperor. Sadly, there is a lacuna of decent biographies of the queen in the English language. One can only hope that the works of Bertieres, Chalon, and Delorme will soon be translated and published in English. Fraser's book does have some interesting details (aside from those which flow from her imagination) and it is much more sympathetic to the queen than Lever's travesty
This magazine is ideal reading for anyone who demands a broad perspective and deep analysis about any current topics related to international foreign policy. Years ago, I subscribed to the magazine and now, as an International Relations grad student, I use articles in The National Interest to address my areas of concentration. The pieces are useful to me because they are so in-depth. I appreciate the pragmatic approach of the writers as well as the wealth of information the editors ensure are featured in each issue. I particularly like the Reporter-at-Large feature and the recent "Conversation with Henry Kissinger" segment.  ---  --- Top-level experts on foreign policy like diplomats and intelligence officers, well-known policy-makers, and prestigious journalists make The National Interest an exciting read. The broad and varied views enhance my studies. I like the magazine because the centrist perspectives distinguish this magazine from the many others I read like The Economist, Foreign Affairs and Foreign Policy. I find that every article offers level-headed reasoning; no sound bites, no bumper-sticker clichï¿½s. The articles offer conclusions that allow me to develop my own informed opinions.  ---  --- For anyone who wants to be up to date about foreign policy, and who wants to develop well-documented opinions from those who have been on the "front lines" of world affairs, this is the magazine I recommend without reservation. ---  --- 2nd year Graduate Student at the Yale University, McMillan Center of International Studies.
This isn't your typical run through game, you actually have to think and take risk at times. It does get a little difficult as stated in alot of reviews but that's the thing I like most about it. I rate this just as good as Jedi Academy. My only flaws were the default controls, those were a pain. I highly recommend changing that and the force powers were a pain to use at first but once you got used to it it wasn't that bad. This has a decent story line as all the Star Wars games do and fun to play. I had to use a few cheat codes on some of the levels (like Level Skip)because it gets pretty tough, but I didn't have to do that much, maybe twice. Anyways, this is a definately must have for all the Star Wars fans out there.
If you like math, I guarantee you'll like this book! The author starts out with some very nice infinite sums from 17th and 18th century mathematics (Newton, Leibniz, the Bernoullis, and Euler's Gamma function). He continues into the 19th century with Riemann and Lebesque integrals, Weierstrass' pathological functions, Cantor's set theory, and winds up with Baire's category theorem. ---  --- Reading this book is like taking a guided tour through Real Analysis (= calculus of one real variable) with the math prof you always wished you had. Its only prerequisite is a working knowledge of calculus; the main points are explained very clearly, so the reader can skip through the book or fill in the details, and will learn a lot, either way. The book is very well written, and a great pleasure to read; I highly recommend it, for students, fans, and teachers
In 1973, director Nicholas Roeg took a Daphne Du Maurier story about a strained family situation, added a child in a red coat and some superlative direction, cast wonderful, talented actors such as Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie, and produced a seminal and classic piece of seventies horror, the unmissable "Don't Look Now". ---  --- Six years later, Cronenberg - obviously, oh so obviously having been influenced by the starkly pared-down imagery and understated elegance of the Roeg picture - decided to put his own markedly different spin on a terribly similar theme, with disasterously boring results. ---  --- To synopsise the plot: Frank Carveth's estranged wife is crazy, and undergoing unconventional therapy at her psychiatrist's controversial institute. Suspecting her of abusing their daughter, he removes her from his wife's care, to the strenuous objections of her shrink. Several people connected to wifey's emotionally crippling past begin to show up dead, and Carveth finds himself fighting to save his daughter from her crazy mother's 'other' set of kids. ---  --- So it's David Cronenberg. So what? ---  --- Performances and direction, as well as screenplay, are all simply mundane. There's barely a shred of the sleek, polished talent we have come to recognise as David Cronenberg, and what we have instead is a sort of mishmash of some of the better aspects from classic American horror movies, as seen through the obviously tired eyes of the writer/director. It's almost got the sense of isolation of 'The Shining', but there are too many incidental characters. It's almost got the same sense of murder-by-numbers as 'Hallowe'en', but lacks the decisive action of that movie. It's close to the stark imagery and sense of motherhood-gone-awry as 'Carrie' (and even the lead actress bears a striking resemblance to Piper Laurie!), but Samantha Eggar's performance is too overblown.  ---  --- Makeup effects, too, are over-ambitious for the time and fail to create any sense of impact or drama, in that they just look silly. Of course, you could say the same for 'The Exorcist', nowadays, but where that film still has the incredible strength of Ellen Burstyn's and Linda Blair's performances, all 'The Brood' has to go on is some deformed alien-figures that hiss a lot. It's not good. ---  --- In short, where a movie matters most, 'The Brood' fails wholly to deliver, instead regaling us with 90 or so minutes of unfulfilling cinema. ---  --- A note on the subtext: It's difficult to feel any sort of respect for the social commentary contained herein. Sure, topics like the state of the Nuclear Family and the negative effects of a Mother's love are riveting things, when handled properly. Unfortunately, when the package and presentation are so obviously hollow and overdone, who could care less about subtext? ---  --- I couldn't.
You don't need to be a student or to own your home to get the Home and Student version. Any one can get that version. Microsoft doesn't enforce the student part and by home, they mean where you live
I bought this model in order to be rid of my almost-new Sony MHCEC70 with its faulty ergonomics and detestable tuner.  Having once owned an earlier PM-series model, this new Panasonic was the obvious choice and it does not disappoint.  Like its predecessor, the PM53 is a nice, powerful compact stereo with (for the money) ridiculously nice audio quality and a good tuner, especially on the FM band.  It can easily be turned up load enough to cause hearing damage and annoy neighbors in adjacent houses.  The remote covers every function and is easy enough to figure out without consulting the manual.   ---  --- Right now, this is the budget stereo of choice for the discerning.  Sony's competing models are cheesy-looking (hog attention on store shelves,) bigger (i.e., take more materials/cost more to ship,) and consequently suffer certain cost-cutting measures like the aforementioned crappy tuner and simplified (and of course, proprietary) antenna connector.  It's like choosing between the Pontiac and the Toyota.  The Sony is for the unwashed rubes who want 300 watts of mylar-coated bling.  The Panasonic is for people who want something that makes pleasant sounds and looks like the rest of the furniture. 
This was delivered as an OEM product exactly as expected.  It came on time, and was very reasonably priced.  I will do business with Webtreo again
I rec'd this today.  I had been looking for a while for a white faced stainless watch and kept coming back to this one from Bulova. (I looked for nearly two years!)  I did some looking around online and in stores and Amazon by far had the best price (they beat everyone by at least $100), so I did what any girl would do, I bought it.   ---  --- It is a substantial watch. It's not a watch for someone looking for something dainty or unassuming. I don't think it's heavy, it just feels like you've got a watch on.  I personally like the size and weight.  I plan on this being my spring/summer watch until it dies or something happens to it.  I have a Seiko Coutura with a black MOP face w/diamonds that I love, but I wanted something different but sort of the same and this one was it. 
 --- I am very pleased with the purchase of the Reese Towpower Class III/IV Hitch Pin Lock from Amazon. This is a sturdy lock and will keep my USMC hitch cover secure from theft. I would definitely buy the same Reese lock again. --- ~ The Boss
 --- GOLF DIGEST is the big daddy of a well-populated family of golf publications. It's self-styled tag line--'The #1 Golf Publication'--is well-earned. ---  --- Where other weeklies report the golfing *news*, GOLF DIGEST is a monthly celebration of golf as life, or at least of the golfing life. It's golf-star-celebrity-packed articles tend to wear titles in the imperative ('Don't Stretch Your Wedges'), giving the sense that the golf world is populated by feverish self-improvers. ---  --- Even those of us who are less than bent on links glory, the photography of this publication looks extraordinary. This aspect reaches its zenith during the magazine's frequent published admirations of the finer courses around the world. ---  --- No doubt about it, GOLF DIGEST is a lifestyle magazine as much as anything else. Yet the semi- to really-serious golfer will find its pages rich with suggestions on improving his or her game. ---  --- GOLF DIGEST anchors the world of English-language golfing publications. Even better, you can frequently pick it up for the price of a few frequent flyer miles
Fellows: ---  --- I picked up the DVD in London, at a cost of 20 pounds, or about US$39.  There were still four copies left at the Virgin Superstore in Picadilly Circus.  So you got be able to find it somewhere, even not on Amazon.
I sincerely hope iPods have improved... I bought a 30G iPod Photo a little over a year ago and was on my second replacement when just recently, outside the warranty (which of course goes from original purchase date, not replacement date), it's kaput again. Now if I have to pay $275 for Apple to fix or replace a three month old player! No way. THREE players on the blink, each after a few months - that isn't just bad luck.  ---  --- That isn't even mentioning the difficulties with the iTunes software or if you change computers. I get a new PC and have to re-transfer 100s of CDs! How lame. That negates all the convenience of the large capacity (I wish other MP3 players had the storage space the iPods have).  ---  --- I just can't justify spending more money to replace this limited, inferior POS again. So essentially over the last year I have spent about $1 a day to have a player and now I'm left with nothing. I will be buying a different player. I will spend far less than $275 and get something that will last more than three months, is compatible with the rest of the players in the world and is easy and convenient to load and use - obviously not an iPod! Unfortunately I can't transfer the music I spend hours and hours loading up (over and over). What a waste of money and time
My children prefer this cookie much more than the standard chocolate cookie with cream.  These are a bit softer than the O's we use to purchase but it also makes them much easier to twist apart and eat! =)  We purchased the chocolate with chocolate cream too - YUMMY
The color of the actually received ear rings was quite light. A darker amethyst color would have been much better and the picture on the computer screen was really deceptive, since that showed a much darker colored amethyst. I won't buy jewelry from Amazon again when it comes to a colored stone. HSN depicts their jewelry much better on the screen and provides better stone quality products
These were double the price on another site! My little girl LOVES these speakers! She is using them with her pc. ---  --- my ONLY complaint and it's my complaint and not my lil girl's...is that the sound quality is poor.  Obviously, not the speakers to get for real sound quality...but kids love them
Where to begin?  Cliched. Pretentious. Flat. Static. Maudlin. Melodramatic. Homophobic. And finally, just plain BORING.  Start with an over-the-top caricature of a deaf-mute Patsy Cline young drag queen arriving the big city, pile on cardboard "colorful" characters like typical AIDS patient, porno star, and loud-mouthed Latina hot mamna, and whaddya get?  An amateur film populated with some of the most UNLIKABLE, UNATTRACTIVE characters ever, all spewing some of the unbelievably BAD dialogue ever written - and to think the (formerly talented) director made THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD also with D'Onofrio? Go figure.  Nice cover art, though
I first found this herb blend in San Francisco. I'm delighted that I can re-stock my cupboard again. I use it on dishes such as salads, poached salmon, chicken. Very versatile. More fragrant than the herbe de provence available to me at the supermarket
While I'm driving, this thing doesn't work at all. There's tons of static and the music cuts out all the time. The only time this FM transmitter works is when my car is still. Maybe it's because my antenna is on the back of my rear window and the transmitter can't reach it. Overall, I'd say this product is garbage
Although these labels were functional, I was disappointed as the paper is far thinner than for similar labels I had purchased previously, and these tended to tear easily
I purchased what I thought were "deals" from 2 seperate vendors and was very disappointed.  ---  --- To get a pair of decent fitting sweats, you have to pay the price, and you won't regret it. ---  --- I hope this advice helps
They're a little pricey, but they work great.  They are easy to clean, dry quickly, and catch almost all the mess my boys make
I regained my sanity after getting these. Sooooo much nicer than disposables
Why did they have to add coconut to these snack bars?  They would have been great without the coconut.  And now I find out I can't return them, and I'm stuck with them.  If you want them, let me know - I'll trade you for some decent granola bars
Photos were excellent. But photo print quality depends very much on the print shop. For the same photo file, it can look like a 4M photo when taken to a below quality printer shop. Photos taken indoor with marginal lighting (no flash used) turned out to be yellowish. Battery life is very long despite its large 3" LCD. Battery charging time is over 3 hours - too long. Photos files viewed on computer looks just great. 8'x10' prints are great but have not tried larger prints. Touch screeen control is a delight and very easy to choose and set. Date on photo is red (would be better if it is black). And the location of the date is not at the far right hand corner
Although this sports new remastering, unless you have either the Golden Hits CD available here at Amazon and your local CD shop, the now out of print Golden Celebration boxed set or the 2 volume "Patti Page Collection" series (Volume 2 is also out of print), this is unnecessary as it duplicates every track on Golden Hits except for Let Me Go Lover instead of With My Eyes Wide Open I'm Dreaming and the songs are arranged in a different order.  Fans are better off looking for the 2 previous out of print collections with Let Me Go Lover to obtain this track and for the rest of this stuff, either buy Golden Hits, the boxed set and the 2 volume Patti Page Collection series, and BTW, Vol. 1 is still in print so you can order it right here at Amazon
I bought this shoes with the hope to give a surprise to mi wife, my surprise was that the shoe size dosent match, I'm really pissed off, if you gonna buy this piece of junk, beware with the size
We bought this - on cassette - in Washington DC on our first day of honeymoon in September 1997. Having flown from Northern Ireland, it provided us with the perfect honeymoon soundtrack as we drove from  Washington to Nashville, along the Skyline drive, down through South West  Virginia, across Eastern Kentucky to Berea, and down to Smoky Mountains  National Park in Tennessee. We are from an Ulster-Scots/Scotch-Irish  background, and during those three weeks we fell in love with the land that  our forebears had settled in so many centuries before, bringing thier  fiddles and folk songs with them, creating what was the core of mountain  old-time music and bluegrass. From the Carter Family right through, every  song is a classic. You must buy this
Worked as expected. A few hardware glitches but that was to be expected
does not function, refusal of cutomer service to replace product. phone service non- existent- rebot online service offered no recourse.  i will be contacting my attorney general in regards to their fraudulent warranty and will never purchase fromj amazon until they drop this compan
I was given a Swaddle Me for my third child.  She has been my only child that slept through the night at five weeks.  My oldest did not sleep through the night until nine months and my second still does not.  I owe it all to the Swaddle Me. But at three months she outgrew the small size.  I thought she was old enough to go without swaddling, boy was I wrong.  It took me a month of sleepless nights to purchase the larger size.  I have had my large Swaddle Me for two weeks and have had two nights of trouble since then.  Thank you Swaddle Me for helping me keep my sanity
I picked up the first Volumne of these Graphic novel series a while ago and I've been trying to get the whole series ever since! The concept is new and interesrting and the art is always great. ---  --- Animal Farm was especially good because of all the twists in the plot line. Nothing is as it seems to be! Take my word.
I do a lot of work out of town and in other states, so I am constantly in unfamiliar or different places. This GPS has saved me tons of time and within the next two months will probably have paid for its' self in saved mileage that I used to spend looking for places. I have recommended it to everyone that I have talked to. It's great, I will never have to Mapquest or ask for directions again. Another Great Microsoft Product
I purchased this card game as a spur of the moment christmas gift for my son who loves monopoly but can get no one to play the board game because of how long the board game version takes. My son as well as the rest of the family was wonderfully surprised to find this monopoly card game addictive and fun to play.  Each of the hands goes quickly and the goal of $10000 is very attainable to reach in a fairly short period of time. I will have to admit 3 people was a bit more challenging and fun than just 2 and we decided it would be easier to keep score of the money by using pencil, paper, and a calculator. Overall, I highly recommend this version
This camera took some great pictures, and I enjoyed it's size and functionality for several months.  I was sitting in a lawn chair at a barbecue last weekend when I was passing it to a friend who was also seated.  The camera fell about 2 feet onto soft grass.  THE END.  The lens assembly is shot, according to my local camera store, not economical to fix.  This was about the softest fall a camera could take, and not work, it was like landing on a pillow.  I will not buy HP cameras again
This is the original and at half the price of the newer charger this is a really great buy.  Fully functional and provides all that it should as a charger for the V188
nice stand, paint has faded a bit after a year being stored outside exposed to the elements, but isn't peeling or exposing any metal.  There are 3 segments, they all fit together easily and are reinforced to prevent breakage or bending, but they're freely attached.  So if you need to move your hammock stand you'll need 2 people unless you push it, if you pull it, one of the angled arms will slide out of the horizontal bar.  You could probably fix this yourself by drilling a hole through the bottom (horizontal) bar and into one of the arms to screw in a bolt, but the steel is very thick, about 3/16" or 1/4" thick
We have switched bottles with my daughter more times than I would like to admit.  She's had gas and discomfort with all of them.  I decided to try Avent bottles...I bought twelve of them and at first they seemed to relieve some of the gas.  But they leak horribly.  Sometimes it's a few drops.  But most times it's like a continuous stream of formula.   ---  --- A couple of times I wasn't paying close enough attention to the bottle while feeding and formula ended up soaking my daughter's bib, her sleep sack, her onesie, and my shirt.  The entire bottle emptied all over us before I knew it...the leak was that fast!  I tried every suggestion given to me:  mixing the formula in a seperate container, mixing it in the bottles, and using sealing disks to mix in the bottle; heating before adding to the bottles, heating in the bottles;  wetting the nipples, not wetting the nipples;  making sure the bottle rim was properly inserted into the nipple ring, etc.   ---  --- I wrote a letter to Avent and called twice about this issue.  Each time, the customer service rep spoke down to me and said I must not have read and followed the directions (which I had).  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE EXPENSIVE, POORLY DESIGNED BOTTLES!!!  These are the worst on the market in my experience. 
The product information states that this bed has 1 inch of memory foam, they must round that number up to the closest inch because there was maybe 1/2 inch.  We didn't even bother to blow the thing up, utter junk, returned for something cheaper and better put together (we hope). if I could give this a negative star rating I would.
Why is it that Us Weekly can't get a copy to me weekly?  Sometimes three weeks will go by without an issue.  Then I'll receive three in one week.  Us Weekly assures me that everything is normal and that they ship them just as soon they come off the printing presses.  I'm not buying their story or the magazine again
My one year old has had this toy for about 4 months now and it's still his favorite toy. There is no end to the amount of fun my child has with this toy and he keeps coming up with new ways to play with it. It's hours of endless entertainment!
This replacement battery is half the cost of Canon's yet offers longer life.  I bought it when I first got my SD10.  When one battery runs out, the spare goes in.  The Lenmar still works great while the Canon is near end life!  I am buying two more since they are so cheap! ---  --- DO NOT buy no name batteries on ebay.  They do not last worth a darn and are basically a waste of money!  Don't do it..
Besides the fact that the straps wheren't long enough to hold on to my son crib, it ended up on the floor every other day!!! Save your money and don't buy it!!!
It worked fine for 2 -3  weeks and then it would get about half way through blow drying my SHORT hair and it would just stop.  I had to let it rest for 10 minutes and then it worked again.  Gradually the time it worked got shorter and shorter and eventually it just stopped all together.  Very frustrating.  Go get a professional dryer.  it might cost a bit more but it'll work!  And probably for a long time
The only reason why I am NOT buying this product, is because the description doesn't give the lengh.  How stupid...!!! --- I am sure I am not the only one to turn this great product down.  Come on, think a little and tell us how long it is
Movie: *****  DVD Quality: *****  DVD Extras: *** ---  --- Dramas about _Teenage Gays Coming Out Of The Closet!_ are so plentiful, they sometimes run together in my mind.  "Edge of Seventeen" is an exception to that statement because it genuinely is an exceptional movie in every way.  The screenplay by Todd Stephens is sensitive and true to life, or rather, many people's lives.  It tells the story of Eric (Chris Stafford), a young man growing up in the small town of Sandusky, Ohio, who is just beginning to grapple with his sexual orientation.  What is so refreshing about the script is that Eric is portrayed as neither a victim nor a hero; he's simply a kid on the cusp of adulthood who is trying to find himself.  Eric is sometimes selfish and thoughtless; other times sweet and naive; occasionally manipulative; but generally a good guy ... in other words: completely human.  That holds true of the other characters in the movie, including Eric's parents who love him dearly but aren't quite sure what to make of his fast-changing moods and appearance; his female best friend (Tina Holmes) who harbors deeper feelings for him; and his new gay "family" (headed by Lea DeLaria) who are fiercely supportive, yet sometimes insensitive to where he is at in terms of his coming out process.  Thankfully, Stephens' screenplay remains true to itself right down to the final fadeout and doesn't cop out by trying to wrap everything up into a neat little package; at the end of the movie, there's a definite sense that these characters will continue to live, learn, make mistakes, and thrive.  (Sequel, anyone?) ---  --- The entire cast is uniformly outstanding.  Chris Stafford embodies Eric in all his complexity; his performance never strikes a false note.  Tina Holmes is amazing as his confused female friend; more than once her face and vocal inflections reminded me of an extremely young Meryl Streep (a high compliment indeed).  Stephanie McVay distinguishes herself as Eric's baffled mother, and Andersen Gabrych is fine as Eric's first same sex crush whose confident veneer covers a troubled heart.  Perhaps best of all is comic Lea DeLaria, who turns in a warm and winning dramatic performance as the Earth Mother whose wisdom and understanding are always available to Eric, regardless of how hard he sometimes pushes her away. ---  --- The Strand DVD offers a flawless letterboxed transfer featuring outstanding audio and video.  The somewhat sparse extras are limited to the Theatrical Trailers for "Edge of Seventeen" and five other feature films designed to appeal to LGBT audiences.   It would be wonderful to have the additional benefit of cast and crew biographies and filmographies as a reasearch tool for the viewers who want to explore others works by the filmmakers, but this is a small complaint.  Overall, this is truly a must-see film, one that is worthy of repeat viewings. 
I have to agree with the previous reviewer who noted the temperature discrepancy.  Items placed closer to the firebox do get MUCH hotter than those on the smokestack end.  This is probably my only complaint about this smoker.  This problem can be moderated somewhat.  You can create a makeshift baffle from aluminum flashing that will help some.  You can also put an aluminum drip pan full of water directly in front of the opening which will not only deflect some of the heat but introduce some humidity into the cooking section.  Personally, I just don't fill it up with meat.  If you're doing several slabs of ribs, use a rib rack at the far end.  ---  --- Airflow and temperature control were problems for me at first.  My particular smoker works best with the air intake vent completely closed.  This is not an air-tight smoker so it's still drawing air through the cracks in the door.  By keeping the fire low and the vent closed, the temperature doesn't climb over 250 degrees.   ---  --- Concerning the temperature--forget putting a thermometer in the space provided by Brinkmann.  It's too high on the lid and it will read quite a bit higher than the food at grate level.  Heat rises, you know.  I drilled a hole just above the handle and mounted a thermometer.  When I cook with the grates at the upper level, this thermometer reads just about right for the level of the food.  When I cook on the lower level, the actual temperature will be 30-50 degrees lower than what this thermometer reads.  It's not totally precise but, hey, it's barbeque!!! ---  --- I've had this smoker for about 3-4 years.  I keep it under a covered area so it doesn't get rained on but the humidity in my area is always high.  I've had to repaint it once.  The firebox needs repainting now but that's been the only maintenance I've done to it.  I just clean out the ashes and the food drippings after each use and roll it under the covering until the next time.  Before each use, I line the firebox and the cooking section with heavy duty aluminum foil.  That makes clean-up a lot easier.  (What did we do before Reynolds?) ---  --- I don't smoke a lot with the Brinkmann.  Mostly I use a Weber kettle grill.  But every time I do a brisket or big roast or several slabs of ribs, I crank this baby up and it's never failed me yet.  Keep the temperature low, keep an eye on the fire and don't open the cooking section very often.  Just let nature, low heat and smoke do their job.  
This is a very nice cover, it is heavy-duty and vented at the rear of the top.  Others say this cover fits tight- and it does, but I can get it on and off by myself.  The trick is, since the cover is a little stiff, you can hold it with one hand above the grill, while you use your other hand to guide it on to the grill.  Then it slides down and fits properly.   ---  --- It looks awesome- really sets my grill apart from my neighbors' "unkept" grills! :)
I have owned numerous Celestron telescopes up to 11-inch apertures, so I expected better. I ordered this for my daughter - it arrived defective; the primary mirror had slipped from its bracket, making collimation impossible. In Celestron's defense, it likely happened in transit. Amazon's return policy is not a hassle, and I'm upgrading her to another telescope. I'm sure that had this particular scope not arrived in a defective condition it would have made a great scope. Only criticism is the plugs on the back to cover the collimation screws pop out a bit too easily
Outdoor remote temperature sensor is not weatherproof.  Instructions state "The remote temperature sensor should be placed in a dry, shaded area."  The battery cover has slits in it that will allow water to enter the unit. ---  --- Hard to see how they call it an outdoor remote
I installed it in my new computer with the easy to follow steps and I find that it gives me wonderful protection.  I would recommend this product to everyone.  I am very satisfied.  I feel my computer is very well protected
I bought these for my husband and the color said rinse so I thought regular jean color. In fact they were so dark that they almost look black. I have washed then about 5 times but they won't fade
This sounds great in theory, being that you don't have to get under the car to drain the oil. Fantastic! But while this has still seemingly been made out to be a great thing for boats and cars, I don't quite agree. You still have to get under the car to change the oil filter, so I'd suggest saving $50 and taking the ten seconds to drain the oil from under the car, which is actually faster than using this device.
One of th ebest comedies of the middle 90's.  This is basically your average "rich kid learns to be a man" story.  It features several of my favorite gags such as the fish stick kittens and The Mermaid.  If you have never seen it this one is wel worth the look
Isalnd of the Blue Dolphins is an exciting book about an indian girl named Karana. Karana is left  behind on an island when all the rest of her tribe leaves. On the island Karana befriends many animals and survives in the uniquie ways of her tribe. Will Karana survive? Will she make it back to her tribe? Island of the Blue Dolphins is an exciting book that everyone should read
I have had this Kensington FM transmitter for about 2 months and in my hands it has very acceptable sound and not alot of static. ---  --- Unfortunately it has one fatal design flaw that makes listening to classical, jazz and any other type of music with any quiet passages VERY FRUSTRATING.  During the quiet parts the unit will shut itself off causing my car audio to emit a ear piercing screech when it loses the signal. I haven't measured it but it seems like as little a 10-15 seconds of quiet causes this behavior. ---  --- This makes this unit useless for classical music and quite a bit of jazz and other similar styles.  If you listen to quiet music, avoid at all costs.  If you don't it is the best transmitter I have tried. ---  --- Sirandar 
This watch just absolutely filled the wish for my 4 year old grandchild!  She is unable to tell time yet, but she wanted a "Princess Watch"  to help her learn, and she was thrilled when she received it.  My daughter told me it was pretty and soft looking.  I insisted that the watch be one with hands, not digital.  So we all were happy and satisfied!  Ina Lan
I travel a lot so something like this I would use to replace all my other USB cables.  Its compact and easy to store away.  I forget which seller I purchase from but its small lightweight and shoudl ship quick
I ordered this Pilates ring because I had used one in my health club- big mistake.  It is plastic with little resistance and is totally useless.  Wouldn't even be of much use for a wheelchair-bound old lady.  (The vendor sent it fast though.
Bought this as an open box.  What a great detector for the money.  I had it out of the box and up and running in 5 mins.  Very easy setup!!  Took it to the back yard and found 3 pennies in the first 10 mins (one was a wheat penny).  The LCD correctly displayed them as a pennies.  As this was my first time detecting, the unit seems very easy to use.  An excellent choice for those wanting a feature filled detector at a bargin price
This movie may not be for everyone, but to me it's highly memorable. ---  --- POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT: ---  --- This isn't your ordinary "travel back in time to alter the futures of people you care about"-flick (Back to the Future--although, granted, it was better made and more entertaining). --- Butterfly Effect is really about (in alphabetical order) acceptance, chance, charity, choice, grownup love, hope, identity, opportunity, regret, and sacrifice. ---  --- Some reviewers mentioned the quality of acting.  Here are my thoughts: --- Kutcher to me always seemed an innocent, caring, small town fellow more than the fun guy most of us might know him as, and that's why I wasn't surprised to see him pull off this role.   --- Amy Smart was good mostly, but glaringly off-key at times (granted she had to show more range the the other actors)
Okay so the pictures of the girls are not my thing but where else can you read a fresh look about cars, eating healthy and fashion? Ladies, this is a must read in order to talk to men! It features fun topics sure to entertain and assist in carrying conversation with all the guys
Fall in love with Nestor the sweet little loveable long eared donkey and his friend Telly the cherub.  This is a wonderful heart-warming story of a "ugly-duckling" sort, the story of a little donkey with a heart of gold, but big long ears.  He becomes a huge hero by carrying Mary to Bethlehem safely.  tells story of the first Christmas.  this one will make you cry, but it has a happy ending.  It is a true must have Christmas classic
Great mat. Provides good purchase, even when getting sweaty. It is a bit short, if you are above 6ft. (like me) to do Ashtanga, but is great for Hatha Yoga
This was the first sales book I ever read. And today, 10 years later, I have it proudly displayed in my library. When I speak with clients who I now teach sales skills to, I still reference it from back in my days selling copiers in 1994. Way to go Stephan!
 --- Lorna is pretty, and her suitor is devoted. The story holds your attention. For many that is enough. Some auspicious beginnings, without depth. So maybe 3-stars for some people. I give 2-stars, if I do not keep it to watch again in later years.  ---  --- I found the romance unfulfilling, and so the movie. Romance movies that I liked better are: "North & South", "Pride & Prejudice"-1940, & 1996 & 2006, "Wives and Daughters", and "A Walk to Remember". Adventure with romance: "The Scarlet Pimpernel".
I switched from the Digital Rebel XT. Since I already had L-glass lenses, I didn't run into problems with the 5D "exposing" cheaper lenses. The 17-40mm really shines on the full sensor! The burst rate is simply astonishing. Missing flash doesn't bother me, heck it's a $3000 camera, I don't expect a built-in flash. I have the Speedlite 580EX, which of course is wonderful in itself. I also have the battery grip which I recommend, as well as the RS-80N3 cable release. Image quality is superb overall - the 5D REALLY shines in high ISO numbers - more so than even the 1D from what I've read. Even at 1600 there's hardly any noise. It allows you to take great, crisp photos in low light where other cameras would require a flash.  ---  --- The camera also is quite light while being very sturdy at the same time. The 3 fps might bother some, but I prefer the incredible burst numbers.
This product is the most flavorful and savory tasting broth I have ever tasted.  It is excellent as a cup of broth or a gravy base
I am gluten intolerent, or what ever you want to call it.  I get asthma from wheat flour, so I've spent the last 8 years searching for the perfect flour.  I've been using this for years now, I love this stuff.  I use it for cookies, cakes, crepes, pancakes, waffles*, madalines, yorkshire pudding, flouring meats for crispy frying, thickening soups and sauces, etc etc.  The only thing that it hasn't worked for is bisquits.  I think because this flour needs a binding agent, such as eggs or Xantham Gum.  With just the butter the dough after baking falls apart.  flakey and yummy, but a total mess!   --- It also tastes kind of bitter raw, but once it's baked or cooked it's exactly the same flavor and texture as wheat flour.   ---  --- You can't go wrong with this alternative.   ---  --- Go forth confidently and experiment with all your favorite recipes using this wonderful flour!   ---  --- I love trying Martha Stewart's cookie recipes, this flour works perfectly for all I've tried. ---  --- *Some recipes may require a little extra leavening agent (baking soda or baking powder), such as waffles, madalines and pancakes.  --- 
Purchased this software because I got a deal with a special price break.  I have a very small business, so a purchase of several hundred dollars needs to pay back quickly.   ---  --- The set up took a lot longer than I had anticipated. --- The customer service was no help - couldn't answer my questions.  I ended up spending 6 hours to get everything right - another day wasted. ---  --- I've got myself stuck with this now and will use for a few months since I've spent the money, but I'm going to look for alternatives in the meantime.  If this is "Quick Books,"  I need to find "Lightning Fast" Books somewhere
There are some good things about this film -- it gives audiences an idea of how insidious the Nazi propaganda machine was, for one thing. It also shows the main character, Antoine Moreau, a (fictional) famous French mime, having his eyes opened to the reality of the Nazis' 'final solution' to the 'Jewish problem'. Brought to a Czech town that has been 'given to the Jews' by the Nazis in order to stage a performance that will be seen by the Swiss Red Cross delegation, hopefully persuading them that the Germans are not as monstrous as they have been portrayed, Moreau changes his original idea for the performance, hoping to get a 'silent' message to the Red Cross that will let them know the true fate of Jews (and other 'undesirables') at the hands of the Nazis.   ---  --- I'll briefly mention a couple of less-than-positive observations, and then get into my main problem with the film.  The production values reminded me a bit of a made-for-TV movie -- and from time to time it seemed that the sound was a little out of sync with the picture. The image quality on the DVD could have been much better as well.  Also, the Shanachie DVD release is version of the film that has been dubbed with English.  This is, in the case of this film, not very well-done.  The cabaret singer, for instance, comes across as completely unbelievable in that her voice doesn't match her face or ethnicity in the least.  Everyone in the film winds up with an English accent, which detracts from any authenticity that might have been retained using subtitles instead of clumsy dubbing. ---  --- Another reviewer below brought up the dubbing problem as it apples to one of one of the children, Stella (portrayed by Linda Jablonska).  Her voice does not sound at all like that of a little girl. She develops a bit of a crush on Antoine, which in itself seems like a pretty natural occurrence under the circumstances -- here is a famous artist who has come to the village to stage a show, with her as one of the leads, who is kind and supportive and friendly to her, who listens to her ideas and feelings with attention and respect. ---  --- The problem I had was with one scene in particular.  Stella has been caught on the streets after curfew and chased by police.  She bites one of them and manages to elude them by squeezing through a break in a fence.  In the process of getting away, she gets muddy, scrapes herself bloody in a few places, and tears her clothing.  She goes to Moreau's hotel and climbs to the ledge outside his room and taps on the window.  When he opens it, he is shocked at her condition, lets her into the room, and begins to try to clean her cuts and scrapes, asking what had happened.  He then draws a bath for her, so she can wash herself.  As Moreau sits down, still in a bit of a daze over what has happened to her, she steps into the bath.  Just before she pulls her dress over her head, she says to him, `No looking.'  He shakes his head to bring himself out of his daze and says `Of course', then repairs to the adjoining bedroom, where he lies down on the bed to have a smoke, allowing her to conduct her bath in privacy.  A moment later, he hears a noise and looks up to see Stella emerge from the bathroom, completely naked, in a full-frontal nude shot.  Moreau gets up from the bed and lifts the covers, suggesting that she warm herself.  She climbs into the bed; he covers her up, and steps away to the other side of the room.  There is nothing about the scene that implies that anything improper occurred.  He has simply offered her care and comfort and sympathy.  ---  --- This shot only lasts a few seconds, but I feel that, regardless of the director's reasoning for shooting it in the first place, it could have been left out.  If the point was to show that Moreau has either had morals all along, or that he has acquired them, it could have been demonstrated in a variety of other ways. ---  --- Earlier in the film, Stella had witnessed one of her caregivers, semi-nude, in Moreau's hotel room (Stella saw this from outside).  Given her `schoolgirl crush' on Moreau, it seemed natural for her to become upset over this.  As a result, however, the scene after the bath comes across as a young girl inappropriately mimicking adult sexual behaviour.  This, combined with the `adult' voice dubbed over Stella's, makes the scene even more disquieting. ---  --- There are some viewers who might argue that, in Europe, `standards' involving nudity and sexuality are not as reactionary as those in the US.  In many instances, I would wholeheartedly agree with them.  There is much hypocrisy in the dynamics of American culture and moral values, and not a little bit of neurosis.  However, the sexual objectification of children is something about which I feel very strongly...and I think the scene in question in this film amounts to exactly that.  Don't get me wrong -- I'm not so prudish that I turn away from even full-frontal nudity in a film, if it's not gratuitous and it's an integral part of the storyline...but here, it involves a prepubescent girl, and could have easily been left out.  It worries me bit that this point has not been made by other reviewers.  Have we become so numbed in respect to nudity in films that many can't recognize an instance where it's not only unnecessary, but potentially harmful?  ---  --- I'm glad I've seen the film -- and I'd recommend it with a bit of praise and some strong reservations, as noted above. With all of the ridiculous claims from some quarters that the Holocaust never happened, I think it's vitally important for films on the subject to be made and seen.  ---  --- The Czech film ALL MY LOVED ONES is an excellent film about this horrible time that has not gotten the attention it deserves -- seek it out. ---  --- n.b. -- This is the second time I have posted this exact review.  I noticed today (6 April 2006) that it has, for some reason, been removed from the site.  I've re-read what I've written, and I don't see anything objectionable or offensive.  The issues I have with the film are discussed straightforwardly.  If anyone objects to anything I've written here, I'd like to know what it is. 
I really don't have much to say about this book holder, not that it's just a book holder.  It's a nice one.  It does it's job.  It's a little too expensive for just a piece of plastic. ---  --- It's strong, sturdy, and it's big enough, even for those massive heavy textbooks, like the Calculus ones.  Although, I would not recommend putting a dictionary or reference that's like 6" thick (even though it still may hold).  It's got little clamps at the bottom to prevent the page from flipping all over the place, although those tend to fall off when you move them.  But that's no big deal.  Just put them back on.   ---  --- This book holder is kind of big, and I would not put it on a small desk in the middle of a classroom, but it's not too big.  You should be able to put it almost anywhere when studying on your own time. 
This is a good jogger if you will be using it for more than just jogging.  I really like the fact that it has a front swivel wheel that you can lock for jogging and unlock if you need more manuverability.  It comes with cup holders, which is nice because a lot of joggers you need to puchase them as an accessory.  Overall it is a good stroller, the only thing that I would change in the design would be the wheel locking feature.  It has 2 individual locks, one for each wheel.  The jogger I had previously had a bar across the back that would lock both wheels at the same time when pressed.  I am extremely satified with the stroller for the price at which I purchased it
I was surprised to have learn of this very old live performance by Cat Stevens (his name then).  I was well pleased with the quality of the performance format and of the tunes selection.  I was, and still am, a fan of his music.  Nice to see a dvd concert of his.  It is old music, but if you're a fan of the man, you'll enjoy it
I've been watching this magazine slide downhill for some time, but they've finally hit bottom.  The bulk of the April 25 2006 magazine was devoted to cars.  Yes, todays automobiles are becoming highly computerized, but the magazine is supposed to highlight the software and hardware that we use on our desktops. ---  --- PC Mag has been drifting far afield, doing articles on Apple computers, gaming systems, and extensive reviews on cameras.  Instead of PCs, the subject seems to be anything that has a computer chip in it, or is in some way remotely related to computers.  The obvious inference is that there's nothing interesting going on in the PC world, so they have to keep stretching just to fill the pages.  I find that hard to believe; I think it's more likely that the staff has lost their focus, or they've hired people who are not interested in or qualified to write about PCs.  The lack of pertinent content makes the dwindling size of the magazine even more apparent.  What used to rival a small phone book is now about the size of Time magazine. ---  --- They now have a "new look", and it's awful.  Their readership used to consist of well educated, technically sophisticated professionals.  These people don't need a dozen arrows pointing into every photograph, with cutesy "handwritten" notes belaboring the obvious.  That's more appropriate for the folks who had a hard time getting through high school and have short attention spans.  Compare this issue to the issues from a couple years ago, and it's obvious that they've "dumbed down" the entire magazine. ---  --- I've subscribed to PC Magazine for years, and considered it a "must read" to keep up with the rapidly evolving hardware and software of the PC world.  But no more -- it's time to find one that has something useful to write on the subject of Personal Computers.
I purchased this item for my boyfriend and he loves it. It is a great lower end badger hair brush. It also conveniently transforms as a metal cylinder for easy travel
The only better broth I've had was homemade by my hubby! My daughter will even heat it for a quick snack, I love it
I recieved umbrella from UncleSams Umbrella shop of N.Y., then returned it as it was too big. I have never recieved a refund of over $25.00. I would like to know what happened and when I will get my money back. Umbrella was picked up by UPS on 03/07/05. I can be reached at: vlb47@earthlink.net  I look forward to a resolution to this problem. Thank you, --- Vick
after buying some lush products from here, i went into the lush store in pasadena where the staff was awesome and totally helpful. after explaining my horrendous hair issues, they gave me some samples of rehab, retread and big and i bought a bottle of american dream. they all work wonderfully. rehab made my scalp tingly and my hair felt so soft. my hair has literally never felt better. i HIGHLY recommend rehab or any lush products for that matter
I made the mistake of buying this light to treat my acne without first talking to my dermatologist about it.  After just using it three times my acne became more out of control than it had in years--my face broke out in places it had never broken out before.  It took me two months of using medication from my doctor to get my acne under control. I would not recommend using this device unless a doctor says it would work for you
This obviously is a re-release of the OLD "Empire Strikes Back" kit released in the 80's. ---  --- A decent size kit (approx 15 inches) it gives an experience modeler a good opportunity at super detailing. ---  --- The kit is relatively easy to build out of the box, but it has many inaccuracies most notably the inaccurate sensor/bridge deflector DOME on top of the ship. ---  --- These inaccuracies can be addressed by looking in the Internet for replacement parts and articles on addressing those inaccuracies. ---  --- However, the kit is worth the price. ---  --- My only disappointment is the kit is not in scale with the new "Republic Star Destroyer" from "Revenge of the Sith".  The new kit for the new movie is over 19 inches long.  In order for this kit to be in scale with the current movie version, it would need to be about 24 inches long.   ---  --- Hopefully someone will make the "Imperial Star Destroyer" to that scale.
i bought my monitor yesterday and found to have a buzzing sound at lower brightness (<100%). just scheduled an exchange LCD
My kids really did learn a lot from this movie, I would recommend it when your child is trying to learn to go on the potty
These are NOT pioneer boxes.  These are MBI boxes. I bought them and was very disappointed since I also have bought pioneer boxes before, and when I compared with the MBI, the latter one is much less sturdy and even the index cards are flimpsy compared with the Pioneer's.  Do not buy these. ---  --- Also, Adorama's customer service is very unfriendly in regard to making their customers satisfied.  They insist that they are the same, that I need to return them on my cost, because of their mistake.  They flew from one reason to another with blame from that they have never carried pioneer products, to Amazon's mistake in naming them Pioneer.  But then their own website also has named them Pioneer.  Anyway, just reconsider about buying any products from this company. It's not worth it, considering the shipping is outrageously high.  It is my honest opinion. 
Horrible advertising on these packages.  It shows a huge delicious bowl of pasta when says 4 pack, but it only makes two "bowls" of pasta.  The servings are so tiny, that if you make both packets together, you maybe get a half a bowl of pasta.  Not to mention that it takes about 11-15 minutes to cook!  Pasta's so sticky you have to use no-stick spray.  The taste is so bad my son, who eats anything wouldn't touch it, and the sauce packet was hard as a rock, so it didn't mix up and left big chunks in the ketchup you have to add.  We tried the mac and cheese too, it takes 15 minutes to cook and again says 4 pack, but that's only 2 pastas and 2 cheeses.  Very expensive, hardly any food, and pretty nasty to eat.  They need to be alot more realistic on their packaging instead of trying to use false pictures and saying "4pack"  Eight thumbs down from this family
This movie is far from being anything great. Some of the characters don't make any sense what so ever with the original cast. Leatherface's role has been mocked. People spend too much time focusing on the other people rather than build up Leatherface. The first TCM is a classic. And the second TCM is great as well. But Leatherface: TCM III, The Next Generation, and the TCM remake have all made the Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise a laughing stock. I really hate new directors coming into the horror scene just to mess it up. The only thing they do these days is make crappy remakes and fill horror movies up with CGI. Enough is enough.
This book is as much about life as it is about baseball. The positive re-enforcement the book gives about accomplishing almost anything is the true message. --- Whenever you or one of your players is struggling, go back to this book to refresh a slumping attitude
I have a Weber "Q" BBQ Grill, and if you are cooking a lot of ribs, you can handle a lot more by placing them in this rack and still have room for hot dogs and/or hamburgers...plus it keeps the ribs from sticking
I have seen this movie in the past on TV and am familiar with the story line. I have also been to Visit Boys Town Since I have family in Omaha Nebraska. I would say if anyone is considering buying this movie, Do. Spencer Tracy makes a good Father flanigan (the Priest who starts up Boys Town) in this movie and Micky Rooney who plays a hoddlem
I must say my first reaction was to be surprised at how much better Hawking is at explaining modern physics than my college instructors were.  Heisenberg's uncertainty principle was just an equation I learned.  Hawking made it seem like common sense. ---  --- Hawking tries a little too hard to be witty at times (and punctuates all of his jokes with exclamation points! just in case you missed them!), but all-in-all, this was a quite readable account of what's presently known about cosmology.  I use the term "presently" guardedly, as just recently there was some big finding about dark matter (it exists!), but from now on, when there are new findings in physics, I want Hawking to explain them to me, because I feel like then I might understand them.  That's why you should read this book.  ---  --- The reason you should not read this book is because you have no interest in wrestling with abstractions with which you will never interact in daily life, and would rather read about global warming or Darfur or something a bit more topical and practical.  This was still a hard read, and I feel like I grasped maybe 80% of it.  For you to decide, but for a former engineering student, this was something I wish I had read when I was taking physics
I've had foot problems this past year. Shoes that I had worn comfortably for years, including other Rockports, Ecco, New Balance, Avia, Reebock, Asics, etc..., were suddenly uncomfortable and painful to wear all day long. ---  --- These Rockports are great. I'm finally NOT in a hurry to get home and get into my slides. I was to the point that I'd pay $300 or better for a comfortable pair of shoes. This shoe is well worth the money
Our library has just finished its magazine usage count, and to my surprise the American Spectator came dribbling in with only a couple of hits, measured by current copies left on the table and check outs of older issues. And yet our patronage here is very conservative. Perhaps people who once read this sort of thing no longer read at all, or maybe, as a couple of reviewers suggested, with Bill Clinton out of office, it no longer has the same appeal.  --- You can change my rating to five stars if you like, for the sake of ideology, but you still won't read the thing. Just like I don't read the Nation anymore
I used this tub for my first born. This is small and holds very little water, therefore, the water gets cold fast! Also, there are holes where the tub folds up so the water spills out of the holes as the baby moves. It can be messy if you are giving your baby a bath on the floor as I did.  ---  --- Our baby would stick her foot and leg out of the tub because it's so small...when I used larger tub, that didn't happen. ---  --- One positive thing that I can say about this product is that it's compact...I kept it at my mother's house and it didn't take up much space. ---  --- I would recommend spending an extra $10 to $15 and buy a higher quality tub. 
How come phone accessories don't qualify for prime shipping? How are they different from other electronics
Our $10 piece of junk umbrella stroller (you know the one) bit the dust on a 10 day trip to Europe so in a bit of emergency we got this one at Harrod's in London, and about had a cow paying 60 pounds for this exact stroller. Turns out it's the best one we could have gotten and the price was right. You can't go wrong. It's sturdy, well-balanced, super easy to fold up and carry around (sling it over your shoulder--it's that light) and has a nice larger sun/rain shield (ours happened to come with a rain cover as well, but this was in London and I don't know if this US version comes with it automatically). The color orange is great for boys or girls and bright enough for pedestrian/traffic awareness. Love it. Like many people, with two kids we calculated that we've gone through half a dozen strollers over the past 8 years (how does that happen?! car seats, too) and this is the best so far. Go for it
I had been on the look out for a Mary Jane pump that I could wear to work with pants and skirts. I finally found this shoe online and decided to give it a try. Usually Steve Madden's run big on me, so I got a size smaller, and surprisingly, it was actually too small. A half size up did the trick, however. ---  --- I love that it comes in patent leather because it really adds a kick to your feet. They're also very comfortable for a high-heeled shoe. ---  --- My only complaint is that the show is actually very deep on the top, and there's quite a bit of toe cleavage. I guess this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it just didn't look like that at all in the picture. Also, the strap that goes across the top of the foot is very low, and if you have wide feet, it could make your feet look even wider (or fatter).  ---  --- Despite those two small flaws, I really like this shoe and find that I can wear it with almost anything (they look especially cute with skirts)
As both a big fan of this movie and a film student, I feel that critics have been quick to judge this film as bad trash. This film has a sexy edge to it, that many other films in the "teen film" genre dare to exhibit. New Best Friend fullfills a fantasy for those girls who secretly desire to live dangerously and party every night, without it actually becoming a reality. The house is every girl's dream, and these girls are alluring and suavely tempting. The acting is far from terrible, and it was great to see Meredith Monroe  in a more sophisticated and darker role than her role as Andie in Dawson's Creek. Dominique Swain once again puts in an A+ effort for her role as the cheeky deviant Sydney. For anyone who loved films like Tart and Cruel intentions,this is the film for you. 
Subtle yet powerful! I LOVE this scent. I actually used the entire bottle instead of using half of the bottle, getting sick of it and then purchasing a new fragrance.  Many compliments from men & women. A little spritz does the trick! You can also purchase a sheer moisturizing  body spray. Perfect for daytime wear ~ especially during the summer.  Pricey, but definately worth it!!
I bought two of these pieces of junk, and believe me they do NOT work unless your room is about 3 feet by 3 feet by 3 feet.  ---  --- IT RECIRCULATES THE SAME AIR OVER AND OVER IN A TINY AREA! ---  --- When they say it cleans 700 cubic feet per hour, that is simply what the fan can MOVE per hour not what it actually will clean in a 10 foot by 10 foot by 7 foot room. ---  ---  --- The fan is so weak at full speed you can barely feel it. Really it is sucking in air through the bottom and blowing it out at the top. Both the inlet and outlet are facing the same side so you are basically recirculating most of the same air over and over again. This thing would need to be 7 feet tall to really work well.  ---  --- In a hospital they have HUGE systems that MOVE the air past LARGER ARRAYS of bulbs. ---  --- So here you are sitting in a room with your kids coughing on one side and this thing recirculating the same air over and over again, in a little tiny airspace, what a great deal. Just be ready to buy 10 of them per room. ---  --- Maybe you can try hanging 5 on the celiing and putting 5 on the floor of a  4' x5' bathroom and it might work in a week. ---  --- Do yourself a favor, and buy a machine that has more UV light bulbs, and has a greater airflow so ALL the air in a room is moving and ALL of the air in the room goes through the filter. ---  ---  --- I gave it a one because it looks nifty. --- 
I agree with the reviews from the other reviewers.  It basically ruined my nails the first time I used it.  However what I did discover is that this is an excellent products for keeping my dogs claws trimmed.  After trimming their claws you often get rough edges.  I now use this manicure kit to smooth the edges and keep their claws short.  They don't seem to mind it becuase it is very quiet.  I must state that I will never again use this product for my own nails
I made this purchase in Oct has a X-mas gift.  They arrived and at quick glance appeared to be fine.  I immediately wrapped the earrings and they were hidden away.  X-mas morning after my young daughter open her gift I more closely examined them.  One of the earrings was completely grayish in color; so dark that I would consider it to be defective.  I called the Netaya customer service phone number only to be greeted with "Hello".  After verifying that I had indeed reached Netaya I briefly explained the defect and requested that I be permitted to return the earrings.  I was placed on hold and then told that "the lady" I needed to speak with was busy and I would need to call back or send an e-mail.  I e-mailed the company twice before receiving notice that they would not accept the return because 30 days had passed since purchase.  I would not recommend
The product is great, I already have the uni-lateral one and it rocks, so i wanted to buy the BI- Lateral aka 2.. --- and two times they have sent me UNI ones that were labeled as BI.. So your  best bet is to bi 2 uni's by themselves until amazon fixes the problem..
Honestly, Led Zeppelin is the ONLY artist that can create monumental album after monumental album and have not ONE bad song.  When you listen to one of their albums in your car, there's no, "Oh, I really like track 2, but I don't like the next couple, so I'll skip to track 5 after that one's over."  Now it is common opinion that the classic albums of Led Zeppelin are the first five, and "Houses of the Holy" is the fifth one.  This is Zeppelin at their pinnacle, which in my opinion, they never fall from. ---  --- "The Song Remains the Same" is Pagey at his best with his Gibson double-neck.  The song itself makes you want to ride the wind because it is so airy, but at the same time a fast-paced rock tune.  Page's initial (and INCREDIBLE) guitar solo makes this song the perfect initial song on this album. --- "The Rain Song" is a lovelorn masterpiece with the lovely sounds of an orchestra to help create this mood.  The lyrics are deep, and while the song to me is melancholy, it is also refreshing. --- "Over the Hills and Far Away" is a 5-trillion star song, with amazing acoustic and electric guitars with mystic lyrics. --- "The Crunge" is groovy and funny.  The bass is really felt in this song, and odd spoken lyrics at the end give a laugh. --- "Dancing Days" is very far out, but a summer-y song with an addictive riff. --- "D'yer Mak'er" is one to definitely highlight Bonzo's masterful rhythm skills, or in other words, GREAT DRUMS!  Equal to that is Pagey on guitar and Robert's singing, "I still love you so...but I can't let you go..." --- "No Quarter" is the quiet masterpiece that is credited to John Paul for an exquisite keyboard solo. --- "The Ocean" is quite the upbeat song on this album with a raunchy riff.  An overall energizing song. ---  --- This is the best deal for this album--do not pass it up!  I hope this will be a permanent fixture to your collection...not one bad song
This is the razor to use!  Excellent product, does what is says
Same HP burner/player that is $30 or more in the local stores. ---  --- Installation was fast and easy. ---  --- Nero software installed fast, very little info on the Nero products, --- to play dvd you need to install the Cyber DVD player on the Nero disk. --- 
We purchased this rooftop cargo carrier to transport our suitcases and beach items during our summer vacation to New England.  We were initially concerned because it was so inexpensive for the size and worried that it might not fit a Trailblazer.  Upon arrival we were pleased to find that it not only fit securely, but was rather stylish too.  Although it appeared weatherproof we soon found that it was not.  It began raining at the onset of our trip.  About four hours in to our fourteen hour roadtrip the weatherproof lining began disintingrating.  By the time we arrived at our destination all our possessions were soaked and coated in tiny grey vinyl flecks.  This cargo hauler might be cheap and look nice, but it is not worth your money
This is The Jacksons second album for epic and producers Gamble and Huff. It would be their last with Gamble and Huff but together they made a great album that doesnt get the play it should. Music's Takin Over, Different Kind of Lady and Do What You Wanna are great, catchy dance tracks. The real greatness here lies in the ballads where Michael's voice is in peak form. Even Though You're Gone and Find Me A Girl are classic ballads. So good, I feel that Find Me A Girl is probably the best Michael Jackson song you've never heard. This is probably Michael Jackson's most overlooked album and its one of his best! The Jacksons all sing together great and you can see why Destiny and Triumph were such big hits after this one was recorded. Overall, great ballads, catchy feel good dance tracks, and Michael Jackson singing his heart out. Get this, you will not be dissaponted
I purchased this toy for my 2 year old son. He absolutely loves it! He had played with it before because his older cousin has one. I had searched in stores around me wanting to buy it but no one had it. Sure enough I found it on Amazon. It's a lot of fun to play with and he just loves to rock out with it. I definately recommend this toy
These noodles are traditional for sukiyaki but work well as oriental noodles or even chicken soup noodles. And made of tofu, they won't add carbs to your diet. I find I cannot eat processed starch--upsets my stomach, so these are a total lifesaver. And the slightly slippery soft texture is soothing. Love'em
Very pleased with the high capacity cartridge with my Epson Stylus CX6600.  "Compatibles" do not compare
Elegant and simple design with that awesome rubber handle that put OXO Good Grips on the "grip map". I bought this to complete my Good Grips BBQ set. The only thing it lacks that some BBQ'rs may miss is a bottle opener on the end of the handle. But that doesn't bother me seeing as I don't drink beer and it also gives the tool a cleaner design. If the dog doesn't get ahold of it, it will last a lifetime
The flavor of this tea is fantastic!  I received some as a gift from Seattle directly and had to find out how to get some more.  Thanks to Amazon for carrying this product
I have several dummies books, from how to build a PC to CCNA.  I had to read this rediculous book when I worked for a very well known DSL provider on the East Coast.  This book was trivial, assumes that you are completely mindless and plugs certain products and services shamelessly.  Yes, I agree, Hot Bot is a pretty good search engine...but it is not the only one out there.  This book has technical incosistansies throughout and is basically a really really long advertisement.  Easily the worst dummies book in print, and Im not being a jerk, I love dummies books, Ron Gilster rocks, but this is absolute crap.  You can honestly get more informed with a magazine
We opened 2 Razor Bumper Buggy's for Hanukkah that we got as gifts from a family member.  Both of them were missing the charger for the battery (and other hardware), so our kids couldn't even play with them.  They were very disappointed.  What is worse, Razor's customer service is TERRIBLE!  They would not send us the missing chargers without a receipt.  Of course, since they were gifts, we didn't have the reciept.  Razor refused to help us until we could get proof of purchase from a credit card statement, which won't be for a couple of weeks.  Then of course it will take a couple more weeks to actually get the chargers.  All this hassle, all the hours on the phone, when they could have just sent us the missing chargers, like any decent company would for such a high price item!   ---  --- Our poor kids, just looking at their motionless bumper cars. ---  --- Of course, we can't actually review whether the prodcut is any good or not until sometime in Februrary when we actually get to use it.   ---  --- Happy Hanukkah to you too, Razor
I bought this ring for my fiance, since i have one, and it's a terrible ring.  We got it apart, and then.....have not been able to get it back together, it's been over a month now, we went online to get the directions, that didn't help either. Plus, the ring is so cheap, it warmed up with the effort from our hands and bent out of shape. It is cheap and completely useless.
A Clean and refreshing scent. Not heavy at all - its top notes are citrus based, and this is  appropriate for day or night wear. It is one of my favorites. It reminds me a little of Happy for Women, which I love, but don't wear, because of its distinctly feminine smell. Cudos to Clinique. Happy is a terrific man's cologne, it smells clean but not like laundry soap ( which too many men's colognes smell like these days )
I just received this today.  Somehow I completely missed that the pendant is on a silver-wrapped wire and not a chain.  Had I noticed that, I probably would not have ordered this piece - and I would have missed out.  It is very nice.  It has a nice weight to it - not too heavy, but substantial.  The wire lays on my neckline just right, and the pendant looks beautiful. I'm very pleased with it.
Here's another great film that sprung forth from the Czech New Wave: another film that, through its small gestures and subtleties makes some big statements. I'll leave it for you all to discover Forman's delightful insights into human behavior in LOVES OF A BLONDE. Suffice it to say, the plot---which involves a young girl's (Hana Brejchová) attempt to find true love as a factory girl---could have become whimsical and even sentimental in other hands. In Forman's, the whole thing is grounded on earth. Instead of being a weightless romantic comedy, LOVES OF A BLONDE aims for realism, and while Forman maintains a relatively light touch on the proceedings, everything that happens to her---she finds love in a piano player, makes love to him one night, and then eventually pursues him to his home, where she meets his ever-bickering parents---still has its own kind of weight to it. The only way I can describe it is, I guess, the weight of real life. I haven't seen a more accurate recreation of a marriage that has dulled out in any other movie than I saw in the second half of LOVES OF A BLONDE, with Milda's parents: it is comic, yes, but it is also uncannily realistic, and maybe you'll recognize your own parents when you see the control-freak mother and the carefree father in this film. As for the blonde of the movie...well, she doesn't necessarily become sympathetic as the movie progresses, but we get a sense of why she begins to attach herself to the piano player Milda: she sees him as an escape from the drudgeries of factory life. Understand that, and you'll find the ending of this film poignant and maybe kinda sad. (Her dream has been shattered, but she keeps on believing it anyway, either out of hope or simply desperation.) ---     ---    But enough of my pretentious analysis, hehe. The point is, Milos Forman's LOVES OF A BLONDE, like Jiri Menzel's arguably more celebrated CLOSELY WATCHED TRAINS, is a film that, though short at 85 minutes, takes its time to observe human nature in the face of oppression, in its own light and subtle way. Its comic surface only makes it seem like a slight movie; but in its subtleties and scenes of comic observation, it has a heck of a lot more to say about our little human foibles than a lot of other romantic comedies do.

 DO NOT USE THIS  --- the dvd thing causes  the xbox to break. when u play games the disk doesnt constantly spin. it reads some and takes break so it doesnt over heat. when it reads a dvd, it must constantly spin. the dvd playback kit fryed my xbox. at most "best buy"s you can buy a dvdplayer that functions better for less money than the one for xbox.
This smoker works like a charm! The only regret I have is that it is a bit larger than I expected, I should have bought the next size down. Other than that the times I have used it the results were great. Temperature is easy to control and that was the main concern as I wanted sometime I didn't have to babysit while I was smoking my ribs or pork shoulder. Others have complained about receiving the units damaged, I guess I was lucky, there was a slight crease in one corner but I was able to straighten it out easily. Better packaging would be an improvement. My .02 is that it is well worth the investment
Excellent!  My 2 yrs. old grandson is loving it.  I purchased a storage case for his Melissa & Doug puzzles, and it helps keep them organized and neat.  Much appreciated by Mom & Dad
These shoes not only look great but feel wonderful. They are so light weight and comfortable. Great product at a great price
I assumed, incorrectly, that Adobe's customer service would be professional and quick. I have called three times in the past two weeks and have had to wait, at a minimum, 23 MINUTES just to speak to someone.  --- When I finally got my product, they sent the Mac verion rather than the PC version I purchased. I called again and waited approximately 30 MINUTES to get customer help. I had originally ordered the PC Standard version and asked to upgrade (and pay difference) for the Professional version -- since I still hadn't received the PC version. Customer service stated that they would ONLY ship me the Standard version to replace the incorrectly shipped Mac Version and then I would have to wait for the Standard verison to arrive at which point I could call again, and ask to exchange for the Professional verion - INSANE!!!  Adobe's call center is easily the worst customer service I have dealt with -- and I've dealt with some bad customer service
My title is my review. The thing worked for a week. After that it wouldn't power up anymore. Chinese junk
It's a beautiful pendant...the stone is genuine and very beautiful. I love it
I wish I could write a review of this product, unfortunately I cannot because the vendor (Verdent) is dishonest. You see Amazon requires all outside vendors to ship all orders within two business days. Verdent Gifts thought they could just sidestep this little detail, not ship my order for 9 days and feed me a line of BS on top of that. Yes, I called the vendor and he told me quote " we are having a difficult time getting UPS to pick up our orders", what a crock unless you are't paying your UPS shipping bills. --- Anyway, to make a long story short, Amazon did try to help and is refunding my money after they tried to get Verdent gifts to make the refund, Verdent refused, so Amazon is picking up the tab...and hopefully giving the boot to Verdent Gifts in the process. Avoid a headache and hassle, steer clear of these bums (Verdent Gifts) and thier dishonest practices
Speedy delivery and I have had a lot of fun with the Zills. I am using the in a Disney sing-a-long singing the Siamese Cat Son
This is a simple book to read through for younger children. Written by native Americans it is a "thanksgiving" book from their point of view, why native americans have always celebrated thanksgiving. It has no mention of pilgrams or not fully proven, overly romanticized stories as most thanksgivings are but simply a beautiful description of the season, the great harvest and respect for the world around them. A book of why the Native Americans Gave thanks during this beautiful season
I upgraded from the 2003 version with no major problems.  The 2007 version is a bit easier to use and works just fine for my small business. The security, however, is not great for a mid-sized company. Since my accountant fully supports the product, they are always available for support
I bought the natural flavour. Didn't find it very palatable the first time. But the next time was much better and now I am hooked on to it! An acquired taste, indeed! The 11-ounce is difficult to down in one go, though.
I could not help but to watch this film with all of my African American female sensibilities. Despite the proficient acting, cinematography and directing, I found the content highly offensive and trite. Mr. Kinksy claimed to love Shanduri and was willing to do anything to possess her affections. He was put off to find out that Shanduri was married, but not deterred. Shanduri gave him what she believed was an unattainable challenge to have her husband, who was arrested for speaking out against the government, freed from an African prison. I recognize that it is possible for a servant to fall in love with her employer, however I know that it is extremely rare. (Ask any black woman who's cleaned a white person's house, `how much love do you have for your boss.' The relationship between Shanduri and Mr. Kinksy was one of abuse of power and emotional manipulation. During the `relationship' that I watched develop, not once did Shanduri refer to her employer by his first name. Clearly indicating an uneven balance of power and control...not much different from a slave owner offering to free his children born to his African concubine. So, Mr. Kinksy gave up some of his prized possessions; it was European influence that created the climate that allowed Shanduri's husband to be detained indefinitely. Though I am one among several with a different review about the film, I have no reason to forget the long history of abuse past and present that women of color experienced at the hands of white people, especially white men. To see such a film is an insult and another example of how Europeans do not understand the masses of African Americans
This is an exact replacement for the high quality, precision made suction cup mount that comes packaged with the Nuvi unit. Unlike many such suction cup products, this one sticks. I bought an extra for ease in "cross-decking" my one Nuvi unit between my two cars. I just leave the mounts in place on the windshields of both cars and move the Nuvi and power cord to whichever car I am using at the moment. A good convenience. Note that I attach this mount to the windshield. I have not tried the red-disc mounting plate that allows the mount to be attached to a pebbly-textured dashboard... I was scared off by the warning that ones you attach the red disk it is extremely hard to remove.
The languages and images don't connect. We were given this as a gift because of the linguistic value, but instead the entire dvd doesn't offer it. The other dvds in this collection are great. This one failed to teach anything
Amazon shipped me a replacement for this order, which was 7 months past the sell-by date on the package.  The replacement was EIGHT months past due.  Yuck.  I won't even bother calling them on it.  I just won't buy any food product from Amazon.  Hey guys--these things AREN"T BOOKS!!!  They go bad..
I bought this as Christmas present for my daughter who will be traveling to Italy this spring as part of a College course she is taking, and she will be spending a semister there next year as well ... She just called me for school to help her resolve an ERROR in the installation: The install reaches 100% then states it has encountered an ERROR, and quits. It remains uninstalled and is thus far UNUSABLE. An awefully expensive piece of plastic that does NOTHING. As a Senior Software Engineer I'd have been fired for less ... The RosettaStone WebSite/Knowledgebase offers NO information on this
This software is very user friendly,easy to install, easy to use.  I would recommend it to anyone
The cocoa is of superior quality as is all Dean & Deluca products.
this is an awsome peice of work the person who thought of this is a genious and i would like to thank him/her because i have perchased this product and it has lasted a long time all the other ones that i have bought have broken in a weeks period of time
I bought this headset from retailer (offline), and returned it the next day. First off, I have to make it clear that I had NO problems with sound. Even though the speakers could have been just a tiny bit bigger (they use 40mm drivers), the sound quality of the headset was just fine. ---  --- However, when it comes to wearing these headphones, the only words that come to mind are "uncomfortable as sin". The awkward squarish shape of the cups made it hard to get any kind of decent seal around the ears (and a bad seal on closed-back headphones ultimately leads to poor sound isolation). Also, I have no idea what material they used for the cup pads, but it is nowhere near soft enough... in fact, I litterally couldn't wear these things for more than five minutes without my ears turning red (flush) from discomfort. Mind you, I also own a cheap pair of Koss headphones I can keep on for hours at a time, so my ears are definitely no stranger to being cupped in speakers either... but these things, they just plain hurt to wear after a very short period of time, which isn't good at all. Discomfort and being unable to obtain a good seal around the ears were ultimately the main reasons for the return.  ---  --- If your ears are tough, you should have no problem with this headset. The sound quality is decent and it should work just fine for you. However, if you're looking for comfort and good sound isolation, you'll want to look elsewhere..
I echo the comments of the previous reviewers.  Don't waste your money.  Not only does this book present a tedious repetition of facts and stories already well known to even a casual U2 fan, it can't even get those facts right!  The book states that Bono's father dropped the family off at a Catholic Church before driving himself to another church.  This contradicts the correct statement on the preceding page that Bob Hewson was Catholic, while Bono, his mother and brother were Protestant.  In the same paragraph the Dublin neighborhood of "Glasnevin" is misspelled "Asnevin".  The hearing aid shop from which Bono took his name is misspelled, and perhaps most galling of all, the author can't even get the full name of Larry Mullen, Jr. right!  And this is just chapter one!   ---  --- I have to agree that this book was simply thrown together to make a quick buck and therefore not worth purchasing.  I would suggest skipping this one and purchasing Bono: In Conversation With Michka Assayas, which includes a pretty good account of Bono's life from the man himself. 
Was using DataManager, but disliked the constant disk access in background.  Acronis backs up well without constant background disk access, and uses less disk space
This is probably my favorite book in med school so far. It is long, but very readable, has excellent pictures and diagrams, and the clinical cases are fantastic. Highly recommended
Pinnacle Studio can assist the amateur videographer in ...  ---  --- Hold on ... let me start again. ---  --- Pinnacle Studio can assist the amateur videographer in editing some fairly interesting ...  ---  --- Dang it! Give me a few minutes here ...  ---  --- Pinnacle Studio can assist ...  ---  --- (Samuel L Jackson-styled expletive) ... how many times is this gonna happen? Start and stop! Start and stop! Enough already! ---  --- One more time. Now, what was I saying?  ---  --- Oh, yeah ... Pinnacle Studio can assist the amateur videographer in editing some fairly interesting video ... if you can keep it up and running. ---  --- Got the idea? ---  --- Just adding my voice to the chorus of those have experienced the frustration of the Pinnacle products. This is a bargain-priced product for which you will pay the cost of long hours of irritation and heart-pounding races to meet project deadlines -despite the software malfunctions.  ---  --- After installing the program, installing the patches, uninstalling the program and patches and reinstalling the program and the patches, I am still experiencing too many crashes. ---  --- If you intend to use this program to piece together a video of Uncle Morty's birthday party, the family vacation or your neighbor's kid's bar mitzvah, the cost and the ease of this program may outweigh the annoyance of its aforementioned weakness. If, however, your video projects fit under the category of "job description," then I suggest spending the money for Adobe Premiere
I didn't want to pay over $50 for a sports bra, but I really wanted a good product and the reviews promised that. So I shelled out the dough for one and they were right! It fits snug so there's no unwanted bouncing and it also prevents uni-boob. I ordered a different sports bra from Champion and this is by far my favorite of the two. The Champion one pushed my boobs in so much it made that ugly boob bump above the bra line that's visible in light t-shirts - ew - and they're supposed to be the same bra size so go figure.  More positives: this one also fastens securely (just start from the bottom and work your way up, it will fit!) and is super, super comfortable. I do wish the price were less so I could buy a second, but I'll have to put that in my budget.  Nevertheless, as a wannabe runner with a large chest, it was worth the investment in comfort and security
It has been a long time since I read the novel upon which this book is based, but I do clearly remember it making sense.  This movie doesn't even make sense (to quote a chicken I know).  Marlon Brando somnambulizes his way through the film and, instead of coming off as sinister, menacing, and dominating, he makes Dr. Moreau into a joke.  Val Kilmer's portrayal is vacuous and silly.  Is the character supposed to be under the influence?  I guess he wanted it portrayed that way.  The script?  Is there one?  Moreau talks about having almost reached his goal.  Where?  His one "son" and his "daughter" do have some fine traits, but both are also pretty ineffectual. ---  --- Several reviews have mentioned the special effects.  I actually saw very few special effects.  The rat-people on the boat were creepy and well-done, and some of the characters did make some superhuman moves, but mostly I saw people in very elaborate, well-done costumes, using well-distorted voices. ---  --- The central character, played by David Thewlis, should have been the focus of the movie, as he is the narrator.  He kept getting lost in the shuffle, and I kept waiting for him to see things that I saw, and to ask the questions that I would have asked.  I like him as an actor, but this is certainly not a memorably good performance.  It is somewhat ironic that he is the witness to animal-human hybrid horror here, but is the werewolf in "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban." ---  --- The film does create a sense of the nightmare.  Several of the characters do show glimpses of depth and genuineness, most notably Ron Perlman's preacher, but then he's well-practiced, from his "Beauty and the Beast" television series.  That was what (barely) earned this film its second star.  Let's vote them all off the island, and start over.  Robert Duvall as Moreau?  Replace Kilmer with Matt Damon?  Casey Affleck replacing David Thewlis
I had never eaten a Luna bar before I made this purchase, so I had expectations that were not even close to being fufilled.  ---  --- When I read "chocolate Pecan Pie" .. I expected just that.. the taste of rich chocolate, with nutty pecans and a gooey sugary base.  What I received was a bar with little taste, nothing at all similar to the name on the bar.  ---  --- In my opinion, the bar is edible if you have no expectations of it... the flavor is barely there. The bar is dry. It is never again be on my "purchase" list  
I ordered before brent birckhead's review came up and I got taken. This is not a leather case for LG enV VX-9900. The correct internal dimension is: 4" x 1 3/4" x 0.5", clearly not a size that the VX9900 can fit into. ---  --- Considering that the seller enters the "product dimensions" as 4 ounces instead of the measurments, one might suspect that this may not be an honest mistake. ---  --- I think Amazon needs to take better responsibility of ensuring that the sellers fill out the description properly
The following were the problems: --- 1. Bent fender - poor packaging --- 2. Sratches in paint in several areas --- 3. Three nuts were missing --- 4. The front wheel hub had lateral play - cannot be fixed --- Planning to return cycle if amazon accepts it
He estado disfrutando de este tv por alredeor de 5 dias, la imagen es muy buena, facil de instalar, lo unico que se deberia mejorar es el sonido. 
For anyone on the fence about these, jump over to my side ;) My (then) 2 year old had gotten a hold of my husband's permanent black marker.  --- We just bought a brand new refrigerator. I turned my back for a few moments, and when I looked back, she had scribbled *all over* my new fridge.  --- I tried bleach, soap, scrubby sponges... nothing worked. My first new appliance was ruined! --- On a whim I bought this. (Couldn't hurt, right?) --- It got it off immediately! (I had to press a little bit to get it out of the grooves.) I was so excited, I started running around my house trying to find things to scrub... --- I know that it removes shoe scuffs with ease, markers or crayons from walls, and a multitude of other "sins" your children may commit against your home.
Amazon's site made no mention of the products not being in stock, charged my cc, and then mocafe held the order without mentioning that shipment was backordered.  My first call to mocafe received a nebulous response along with an offer to leave a voice mail for someone else, and my second call (upon not receiving a return call) revealed the real facts.  Having a credit card charged for items not in stock is *not* cool.  Beware
I have listened to the cuts from this CD and was amazed at how quickly it  transported me back to the time.  There were several tracks that I was  delighted to see since the artists were not popular enough to have an  entire album re-released.  If you are in a mood for a good dose of  nostalgia, this is the set for you!
Dolph Lundgren stars as a Mercenary sent to kill a Tribal leader and then him discovering the wrong of his nation,Dull and just plain pointless (And Stupid) action film suffers from Inept Action scenes and logic lapses. Lundgren is Imposing but can't act
I bought this seat because we have a small eating area in our kitchen, too small for a full-size high chair.  The seat has worked wonderfully from age 5 months to now age 21 months.  I do find the seat hard to recline or sit up but I have only had to do that a handful of times as once you find the right setting for your child it stays there until he/she is ready for the next setting.  The cloth lining is very easy to remove, wash, and put back and the plastic under the seat cover is easy to wipe clean.  The tray is easy to put on, remove and again wipe clean or wash off in the sink.  I have also found the seat easy to take on and off the dining chair when I need the chair for entertaining others.  My daughter has never complained about sitting in the seat and, now that we are no longer using the tray but still using the seat as a booster, enjoys having her own place at the table.  I highly recommend this seat for parents looking to conserve space in their dining areas but not sacrifice convenience or comfort. 
I bought as a gift for my sister in law and she absolutely loved them. These are some great looking shoes.
The light was very good, the magnifier (very tiny) made of plastic which was optically difficult to look thru if you already wear glasses.  But the worst part were the tweezers in themselves.  They were difficult to squeeze togeter because of their placement on the handle.  Also, I am used to sharp tweezers that come together tightly over the hair.  These did not.  So they do not tweeze well at all.  Wasn't worth all the bother of a return.  I just threw it away.  It was a good idea for a product, just poorly made. 
Simply put, this is a great magazine! I have been a continuous subscriber for the last five years, and Country Gardens always deliver.  The lay out is easy to follow and is NOT overridden with advertisement.  The articles are quite enjoyable and informative.  Of course there are plenty of gorgeous photos to suppliment the articles.  God, I love that! --- I too wish that this was a monthly publication. However, I will not complain. I don't want to see a good thing ruined.  So, I simply look forward to each issue and settling down for some great gardening articles, diagrams, advice and photos.  --- Hats off to the Meredith Corporation for their consistency in excellence! This magazine continues to give. Go on, get yourself a subscription! You will love it! FIVE stars all the way
The reviewer below identifying himself as "An Electronics Fan" obviously has a deep bias against Bose.  His multiple reviews about Bose products--here and elsewhere--are transparently motivated by some animus against Bose.  Was he fired by Bose? Did a member of the Bose family reject his romantic advances?  Did a Bose executive accidentally run over his cat?  Did he drop a Bose speaker on his foot and hurt his toe? The true motivation for this guy's negative reviews would be fun to know.  In the meantime, what we do know is that he has no credibility, and his reviews (two here, others elsewhere for other Bose products; he's made maligning Bose his life's work, apparently)) should disregarded. ---  --- I bought a set of black 301's several years ago to go with my Onkyo receiver.  We have it hooked up to a television and DVD player for movies.  These speakers are in constant use both for the DVD and for music of all types.  The room in which they are placed is huge, with an 18 foot-high flat ceiling.  The speakers saturate the room with exquisite sound day after day. The speakers work fine for spoken audio for DVD's; we can hear dialogue perfectly; I feel no particular need for a surround-sound system. Several times my young daughters have turned on the 100 watt amp with the volume turned all the way up or close thereto. I feared a ruptured speaker cone, but the 301's are very forgiving, no damage has been done. The cats sleep on the speakers; they clean right up and still look new after five years.  These speakers keep on giving total satisfaction, and I quite simply love them. ---  --- About three years ago I decided to go all out in another room and bought the highest quality stereo stuff on the market, or at least what I determined to be best after a lot of research. This included a set of the gold-series tower speakers from Monitor Audio. (The speaker cones are metallic, with some amount of gold, and gold connections, etc., etc.) These Monitor Audios have to be the best looking speakers ever made (real wood veneer cabinetry, with the gold cones and the black covers, etc.). These speakers cost well over a thousand dollars each.  Well, I must confess, as awesome as the Monitor Audios sound, I can't really say they sound any better than the Bose 301's!!! They can maybe handle more power, but I assure you the Bose 301's will play loud enough to bring the cops to your doorstep in five minutes or less. ---  --- So, when I recently set up my third stereo in a bedroom, I looked forward to buying a third type of speakers.  I ran around and listened to what I could find on display.  Well, after much contemplation, I went for a second set of the Bose 301's!!!  They just couldn't be beat, and I would have gladly spent more if I had found something I liked better. But I'm not going to spend more just so I can say I spent a lot...there has to be increased performance. And, in my opinion, the 301's couldn't be out-performed by any other bookshelf speaker of any price range.  ---  --- My first set of 301's were black.  This time I went for the cherry. Folks, these are absolutely beautiful speakers: almost as cool looking as my Monitor Audios.  The black cover and the black housing fixture in the back really accentuate the cherry colored wood. No, it is not real wood, but it looks very nice.  These things are simply gorgeous. The kind of "mod" or futuristic shape which Bose has designed really stands out in this lighter-colored version.  And, yes, they sound just as good as my original pair.  I listen to soft music (jazz, typically, or ambient) in the morning and these speakers deliver all the nuances at very low volume; I listen to hard rock at high volume on other occasions, and the 301's don't scare away or distort at all: these things would tear the house apart before they'd lose sound quality. ---  --- So, yes, I recommend these highly.  They'd still be the speaker of choice for me at three or four times the price
This is a great, funny book.  It may be my favorite Jeeves & Wooster story
Grew up on this group. Love them then and love them now. Own the "Best of" Collection but you can never compile the best on one CD. For those Winans fans you know what I'm talking about. These brothers are music genuises especially Marvin Winans. Like Stevie Wonder they were ahead of their time. My favorite song on this album shares the message of all times. "Together We Stand" opens up the eyes to all race,religion, and creed that its time to come together if we want to see a change in this world regardless of background. Entire album is great including the celebrity appearances such as Stevie Wonder, Teddy Riley, and Aaron Hall.  I like the flavor the cameos add to this album. If you're into mid-tempo music this is the album to purchase
The watch performs as advertised. ---  --- Atomic clock.  I live 2k miles from Ft. Collins and the watch automatically syncs every night, even if I don't put it near a window. ---  --- Solar recharge.  The watch arrived with a low battery.  It charged up to full after sitting in the sun for an afternoon.  Since then it has been on full charge with no special actions on my part. ---  --- The watch is big and heavy.  I take it off when typing because it slides down to the end of my wrist and knocks against my hand. ---  --- The watch's user interface is unintuitive.  This is the first watch I've owned where I had to read (and re-read) the manual to set an alarm or the hourly charm. I find the Timex interface and the old-style Casio interface much easier to use. ---  --- In the interests of saving battery power, the alarms are short and quiet.  I can't count on this watch's alarms to wake me up.  It'd be nice if the watch had a power-hog mode with loud insistent alarms and long illuminations. ---  --- All in all, I like the watch.  It is nice to have a digital watch that sets its own time and doesn't run out of batteries.  I wish the user interface was more intuitive, the alarms were more effective, and the watch was smaller
I bought this product for my husband. He tried it out on one of the hottest days. Sunny and 90 degrees. He is very particular on how he washes our vehicles and it usually takes a few hours. This really works. Not only did it cut the time it takes to wash the cars but it is amazing. It looked as if he did the vehicles the old way. There were no streaks. The truck looked like it was polished. Unbelievable...... I would recommend this product to anyone. Buy it !!!!!!
Alien invasion stories have been done to death since H.G. Wells gave us The War Of The Worlds so it is extraordinarily difficult to come with a new slant to this time-honored genre. Well, William C. Dietz pulls it off with Death Day and the concluding volume Earth Rise. What sets Death Day apart from most of the invasion tradition is, first of all, the invading force being made up of different races. This makes an interesting dynamic and gives the enemy character as their squabbles, in-fighting and fight for freedom (some are slaves to others) make for something new, different and engaging. Also, using racism amonst the aliens as well as the surviving human population rings a true, and tragic, note. The surviving pockets of humanity withdraw within themselves, close off their borders and horde resources. The aliens favor people of color and place them as overseers as human slaves are forced to work building alien temples on Earth. And, sadly, collaborators work with the invading force to control the humans. But the seeds of rebellion have been planted. Humans and enslaved aliens are fighting back and this first book sets up an alliance between the enslaved races. All this is interesting stuff and makes for a fresh approach. I enjoyed this book and recommend it highly. Dietz is the best SF writer working today when it comes to letting character drive the story no matter the setting. 
I was expecting this book to be a great story, but very disappointed. I cannot believe the publisher allowed the author to publish this book as it is. The book is insipid and dull,  has no flow, no story, or no plot. Let me present an example. I have read many insightful Newsweek articles by a writer Allan Sloan. For example, Sloan describes a Sprint merger event in this way, "If talk is getting cheaper, why did MCI WorldCom pay $115 billion to buy Sprint? The once staid phone companies have launched a merger blitzkrieg in an effort to emerge at the center of the wired world. Can regulators handle the complex new order....."  It has a clear logical axis, and has a force to attract readers into it.  ---  --- But Jeter describes it like this,  "The merger announcement of WorldCom and Sprint spurred building activity around Worldcom headquarters as real estate developers readied for economic prosperity. The real estate inventory swelled with new planned unit....." It always presents off-center, trivial detail which makes a reader bored. 70% of books are consumed to described a dry and dull fact, like "the merger of company A & B raised the stock to $X" etc. There is no insight here.  ---  --- But unfortunately, unlike Enron scandal, there is no other book that centered on the Worldcom scandal. You would get much better comprehension by collecting articles in Newsweek or Business Week, if you have LexisNexis or EBISCOhost.
Much has been said about the technical aspects or systems requirements of the game, as have many reviews for Oblivion and other next-gen or advanced games on the market today.  Caesar III was quite old, the sequel was always going to be further along with the system demands.  It was worth the wait. ---  --- Let's talk about the game: ---  --- The basic gameplay is intuitive.  Not a lot you haven't done before.  The interface is pretty standard and can be minimized off the screen for screenshots or just zooming around without distraction.  Which you really should do.  As with all these types of games, you can spend a lot of time building and developing.  You need to get a cup of tea and sit back with this one, for the closeup views of the city at work and at play is what is so new here. ---  --- The graphics look somewhat standard on a zoom out, top down view.  There is a lot that looks familiar.  Until you start to get a closer look and the texture details come to life and you realize there is another level of realism here as you watch the shadows lengthen along the plaza near the sparkling fountain as the midday sun moves across the sky and the trees sway in the breeze.  Wow.  No other Roman game out currently comes close. ---  --- This has everything you always wanted with Caesar III and had somewhat with CoTN, (Children of the Nile) although the buildings here are more substantial and better realized.  The CoTN feature of being able to follow behind a person as they move on the streets, saving you the hassle of trying to maneuver the camera views to get a realistic walkthru experience, is one that they should have implemented here.   ---  --- I would have liked to see more variety in the housing, also in the goods, particulary food.  There are only three foods, grain, vegetables and meat - cattle.  No figs, cheeses, fruits, pork, chicken or fish.  The production lines are very simplified, with no bakeries for bread and no weavers for cloth.  The grain goes to the households and the wool straight to clothing or armor factories. ---  --- More decorative options should have been available as well.  Overall, while the quality of what exists is very good, there is certainly room for an expansion.  I hope that they do address these things in games to come.  It's part of the appeal and adds to the longevity and continued interest in the game. ---  --- The maps are overall somewhat small, although a game this graphic intensive would have to reasonably limit the size to facilitate performance.  There are very limited sandbox modes available, at least for now, and I can find no user created scenarios currently available due in part to the complexity of the unsupported editor. ---  --- But again, what there is is very good indeed.  All of the structures are beautifully done with attention to detail.  The landscape can be breathtaking, with a variety of ways to put your city together around the terrain.  And enough hustle and bustle on the city streets to bring it to life.  And did I mention that you can zoom all the way down INTO an arena or colliseum, watch closeups of the games or swivel around from the floor of the arena and watch all the spectators coming in and out and moving around or cheering? ---  --- I am currently running a mid-line gaming system with a NVidia 6800, a system that can run Oblivion fairly well.  I had to update some drivers as well as defragment my hard drive to run this game smoothly.  I hadn't experienced many lags until I had built up a larger city or had been playing for several hours and my system started to protest. ---  --- I replaced the game launcher icon installed by the game to the Desktop or Program Files with a shortcut I created from the game file Caesar.exe to actually get the game to start, something I found from the forums was a consistent problem. ---  --- There are some bugs with the trade routes.  Opening them before you have goods doesn't seem to be the problem as much as setting the ports to sell goods you will sell but don't have in stock yet.   ---  --- I'm not thrilled with the number of people it takes to man each prefect, but it usually seems to work well enough, except on high speeds where the frequency of fires seems to increase, but if you have more than two or three buildings burning you are better off destroying those and rebuilding than waiting for them to get put out.  You can easily find your entire city in flames very quickly! ---  --- While it certainly has a few faults, most things are a matter of preference and having an adequate, clean system.  The core game itself is fundamentally solid.  It takes work to build up economic stability based on trade and taxes and how well you handle your production chains.  You can create, with any scenario, stable cities that will largely run themselves, aside from the requests/demands from the Empire.   ---  --- Your ratings screen will tell you things you need to do to meet your goals.  For instance - Prosperity would also mean higher levels of housing, especially villas, as well as successful taxation and trade.  Better educational coverage not only affects the Culture rating, it affects the Security rating because better education means less crime  as will having good coverage for Jupiter, who will frequently remove all criminals as his blessing.  Good religious coverage will affect both your Prosperity and Culture ratings as you then evolve your housing.  The military will automatically meet a threat to the city and doesn't require a lot of micromanagement as long as you have everything in place and well supplied. ---  --- With the stable gameplay, depth, realistic economic simulation, great music and breathtaking graphics, it's not only a very good game but the best of the current selection of city-builders.  So if you have to chose, I would recommend this one first.  Enjoy
Bought mine sometime around Christmas and took it into the water for the first time on a trip to St Thomas last week.  It died within 10 minutes of being in the water.  It was never more than 5' down while I was snorkeling. --- While I never tested the compass or thermometer against known "accurate" ones, it seemed to work well enough for my purposes.  Just keep it dry
The software requires a "patch"...not a big deal. ---  --- Once I got the thing up and running my attention span was about 5 minutes.  The "goofiness" is a detriment and the aspect of trying to learn is hindered by the balance of trying to figure out how to use the software. ---  --- It has a tutorial but that is a waste of time as well. ---  --- If you are SERIOUS about trying to learn some basic conversational Spanish, try something else.  Don't waste your time or money on this one..
We LOVE this item!!!  We get older TV show DVDs from Netflix and they generally are not in the best condition when they come.  If the cleaner doesn't work, and it generally does, our back up is the repair stuff, which almost always does.  I think out of 30 disks, only two were not fixed. --- 
This case looks good and protects the camera adequately, but is too bulky. It hasn't got a lot of room inside - I was unable to fit an extra SD card in its little case and a spare battery. The belt clip is difficult to use, and I end up carrying the case in my hand most of the time. There are better cases for this camera
I don't know what the reviewers before me were talking about.  I use this at Kroger, Giant Eagle and Target and don't have any problems with it fitting a regular buggy at the store.  It's sturdy, and easy to use.  Don't pass this one up
Good modeling tool with great 3-D graphics which allows the user to view from any direction. The component selection is adequate and the tutorial was informative allowing me to get started designing within the first hour of installing the product
I used to love Curious. I asked for it for my birthday and my boyfriend bought me the large bottle with the atomizer and the lotion. However, a few months after I got it, it started to smell funny... over time the atomizer became very hard and had a sticky film all over it. When I opened the bottle I gaged at the stench. I poured it down the sink and it was yellow. I do not recommend buying this product and if you must have this scent please don't buy it with the atomizer. The lotion still smells good.
The shirt fits well, good style, good shirt.  But Bealls of Florida sucks as a retailer.  Their customer service is rude, crude, and unrefined.  Even the supervisors of Customer Service suck, they don't return or accept any items back.  So BEWARE, you better be damn sure that size fits (ordered product before).  Because Bealls of Florida will not let you return the item for different size or style.  I will not shop here again!  I repeat, I WILL NOT SHOP HERE AGAIN.  THIS PLACE SUCKS AS FAR AS A RETAILER
After reading all the rave reviews, we put Pupsqueak on our Baby's registry, but were very disappointed when we received one as a gift and he didn't work. We tried exchanging him for another one at Babies R Us, but we couldn't find one that worked. So instead we exchanged him for the Dinosaur (I forget his name). Our daughter loves him. Since he's soft we are not afriad with placing him in her car seat with her. She loves falling asleep holding onto Mr. Dyno
I never adjusted a watch band before and I thought it was going to be difficult after reading the other reviews on the other watch tools. This tool could not have made it any easier, I didn't break any pins and I adjusted two watch bands the night it arrived with ease. You will need a pair of needle nose pliers to pull the watch pin completely out of the band. I adjusted an Accutron Lady's York and a Swiss Army Men's Maverick. I used the tool to remove and replace the watch pins, just line the pins and squeeze the pliers slowly. The accutron used solid pins and the Swiss Army used pins that looked like they were screws but were pins that are cut or bent in half so always push from the end that looks like a screw head
I just got this camera recently along with the printer. Setting up was very simple. The only problem I came across was putting the ribbon in the printer. You have to use your finger to remove the slack from the ribbon but it's not that easy. When you put the ribbon in the printer it gets caught on something and could damage the ribbon. It takes time and tons of patients to get that ribbon in the printer. The pictures come out very nice and print even better. I washed a couple of pictures to test the quality and they came out flawless. This camera is a value and shouldn't be passed up. The screen on the camera is huge and the buttons take some time to get use too. If you have any further questions feel free to comment them and I'll reply as possible
We have a small home and decided to opt for this type of high chair instead of a stand alone. We just love it and so does our 6 month old
I also found this "Best of" collection to fall very short of the "BEST"! There are clearly MANY other episodes they could have, and SHOULD HAVE used and included to make this truly a "Best of" feature. The few cases they did showcase were by far NOT the scariest! A definite disappointment,...though still a fan!!
Brando can sing!! --- Guys and Dolls is proof. One of the all time great musicals and the biggest box office hit of 1955, has Brando as the main lead and he is ably supported by THE VOICE - Sinatra. Now only a mad man will say that Brando is a better singer than Sinatra, but to give Brando his due he sang well and carried of the role brilliantly...like wise only a mad man will say Sinatra is a better actor than Brando. ---  --- Guys and Dolls is a very important film in Brando's career. It is the first light hearted movie he made. All his movies before this were heavy dramatic stuff. This is the first movie where Brando is having fun and what fun it was. ---  --- Great songs, great acting and great stars...GUYS and DOLLS is 4 star entertainment all the way. ---  --- Brando and Simmons along with Sinatra and Blaine are amazing. 
I selected a Sony VF-30CPKXS polarizing filter but it took me to this page where I got a Sony VF-R30NKX 30mm Neutral Density Filter. There is a big difference. May 9, 2006. I hope this is a mistake and not intentional deception
Bought this product for my two sons ages 4 and 6.  Within the first week one of the sticks was broken.  Called the company and they sent out another one, but before it could arrive the other stick broke.  They aren't made strong enough to use.  They plastic simply cracks and totally falls apart.  We ended up throwing it out
I've been subscribing to Paste for over a year now, and it's a great magazine. I agree with what others have said about the writing: the interviewers often seem in love with their subjects and deal with the musicians as fans instead of as journalists. There are tons of reviews in each issue on a wide variety of bands and music, and the sampler CD and DVD are worth the subscription price all by themselves. It's a great way to listen to bands that you would never have heard otherwise. If you love music and are spending a small fortune on CDs, this magazine is for you. My only real criticism of the magazine is that it is very text heavy, with tons of small print jammed onto each page, often with a background picture/design behind the words, which makes it a chore to read. I would love to see larger print and less eye junk on the pages. Then again, I'm closing in on 40 so younger eyes may not find it as problematic
I ordered one each for my 5-year-old daughter and her 2 friends for Valentine's Day.  Nice pearl color and oval-like shapes.  Slightly too big for a 5-year-old but would be good for older children or a small wristed adult. Very dainty.  A great buy for the price
Fit well.  Great for all kinds of athletic workouts.  I'm ready to buy a couple more pairs
I used this maybe 4 times when the "in" stopped functioning, but it mysteriously *would* work in reverse.  I wish I read other people's reviews on this before I bought it. Horrible waste of money
The thing broke!!!  I never thought I'd  see a chain breaker tool that would break under the stress of taking apart a chain!!  And the worst part is, I only used the thing about five times
... for giving every dance studio and popular dance genre the hope that they too can be the "next Riverdance". The dancers are all talented, if self-consciously hip, and in great shape. But the numbers that focus more on T & A than fancy footowrk really did this show in for me. I love it when risks are taken with conventional dance forms, but ballroom dance is OTT enough ( if you've ever watched a competition) and doesn't need to be tarted up beyond recognition, the way it is here. Add the disjointed lighting and editing effects and what you have is a hot mess
Am I the only person that felt this book was twisted, disjointed, and something was just not working?  The beginning was great but the second half left a lot to be desired. This could have been a great story, the author veered off track or something
This is a compilation, but the original Incense and Peppermints album was really revolutinary for the time. I will date myself now, but I remember hearing this song on the radio in our car and was mesmerized by it. It was the first Lp I had ever bought. I actually wore out the groves on the Lp and came across another a few years ago. To this day, almost 40 years after I first heard the Strawberry Alarm Clock, I still like Incense and Peppermints as well as their other songs. Their style ranges from acid rock to jazz. The musicians are all very talented and the band works as a team as opposed to many of the bands of the era. Their recordings are really high quality and certainly not over processed like a lot of today's music is. SAC was in an era where 60's music was in transition from the early Beatles and old time R&R sound to a more acid rock sound. Lyrics like 'tune in, turn on, turn your eyes around.. look at yourself' were typical of SAC's lyrical style as well as the thinking of the times. It was an odd time. On one side, we had Woodstock, mini-skirts, muscle cars and fun fun fun, But, on the dark side, there were civil rights problems and the Viet Nam war. This transitional period was a kind of awakening for the country and for music. Although not as popular as names like the Doors, Jefferson Airplane and Steppenwolf, the Strawberry Alarm Clock still had a huge following. My only regret is that I didn't get a chance to see them (or the Doors!) when they came to the city where I lived during the late 60's. This album is a nice compilation of  SAC's hits. The songs are as fresh and original sounding as they were almost 40 years ago.
This is a fine product. The 3 LED bulbs pack a vast amount of illumination. I ordered 4 of them and have no problem lighting up my whole livingroom. I left 1 unit on for over 6 hours and its was still burning brightly when I chose to shut it off. You will not be disappointed with these. Awsome
I found these shoes by searching the women's option for running shoes.  The name may say Unisex, but there is no indication that the sizing is 100% male.  Not even a note stating that a woman should subtract 2 or 3 or 10 sizes from her normal shoe size.  ---  --- When the shoes arrived here, they were huge. I tried to return them, but Amazon considers this to be MY fault, and planned to charge back any shipping, promotions and coupons against a possible refund.  I had done very well using a coupon, a sale, a "buy $80 worth of shoes and get $20 off instantly" promotion and Amazon prime, so my "refund" would be less than nothing.  ---  --- That's right -- if I return the shoes, I owe money.  Because Amazon made no mention that shoes found in the women's section of the site might be men's shoes instead.  Yeah, that seems fair
I am a firefighter and find the tool not only useful but space saving and extremely functional as well
The one size fits all doesn't fit my slim body...and the item looks "made in China" if you know what I mean.  Rather try the double pearl thong or black single pearl thong.  They look much "classier" than the transparent beads with nylon string of the "string of bubbles" panty
This is very expensive for what is essentially hydrogen peroxide and baking soda. which would cost the average person about 3 dollars.
Got this as a gift and it was one of the first things she "played" with, well more like laid and stared at.  Now she's 4 1/2 months old and she still loves it.  She loves to grab at the fish, shake the rattle and twirl the lobster.  For awhile, it was a whole new toy every week because she would notice something new on it.  Great for putting her down and keeping her entertained while mom grabs a bite to eat.  Also good to take places because of the hard plastic bottom.  Music isn't too annoying either
The latch is pitiful.  The phone fits nicely but that latch is NOT secure.  With in 30 minutes of having it my phone came out and hit the tile floor at a customer's house.  Tons of fun watching your $500 PDA hit the ground and the battery come flying out. ---  --- Phone is ok but the case is getting replaced ASAP!! ---  --- DO NOT GET THIS CASE!
They changed pretty much everything. For starters they completely removed all of the normal menus such as File, Tool, and Edit. Which means you can't use the keyboard for quick and easy menu access. Well maybe you can, but you would have to memorize all of the commands instead of having the nice little visual cues which made previous versions of Office (and almost all other PC programs) so much easier to use. You basically have to use the mouse for everything. And in my experience there is no faster way to repetitive stress injury than over-mousing. ---  --- The Ribbon is just awful. First of all it's huge. It takes up about FOUR TIMES the space of my customized toolbar. They place nearly every button imaginable on it. And as far as I can tell you can't change it around or simplify it. Every function is displayed all the time whether you need it or not. Which makes finding anything a real pain in the neck. You can make the ribbon retract which at first glance seems nice. But in reality it turns what used to be simple 1-click operations into 3-click operations (extend ribbon, spend several minutes searching for button, click button, retract ribbon). Good grief! What a pain. ---  --- This software didn't last 24 hours on my system before I restored my old version of Office. This new interface is about the most awful thing I've ever seen on a computer. I know of certain free open source office suites that I prefer to this monstrosity. That being said I still prefer any and all previous versions of MS Office to the free one. In fact I would rather be using my old Wordperfect from 1995 than this *thing* that MS is trying to shove down our throats. If only I hadn't thrown that disc away six years ago... ---  --- Before you "invest" your money in this software I strongly recommend you download the free trial version. Then buy an earlier version
Great, safe and nice looking bumper!  I would recommend it without hesitation
This bigwheel is so poorly made.  You have to affix the pedals and they do not stay on.  We put duct tape around the rod that holds the pedals on so they would stay.  The seat back has cracked already and we've only owned it one month.  The tassles on the handles don't stay in and the wheels are completely smooth so they offer no traction.  Lastly, there is no breaking mechanism.  Anyone who remembers riding a bigwheel knows that having a break is a must if you like to "skid out"!  Keep looking.       
Following Orson Welles' fascinating yet tantalizing career can be frustrating for the aficionado.  So much of his oeuvre remains hidden from view that each discovery from the archives is greeted with an inordinate amount of enthusiasm.  Take this intriguing yet relatively disappointing collection of documentaries Welles directed for British TV in the 1950s. ---  --- "The missing link in Welles' work," exults the snapcase boilerplate.  This is a bit of an overstatement, given that far more significant works haven't seen the light of day ("Don Quixote" and "The Other Side of the Wind," to name a couple). The documentaries do help to fill the gap in Welles' output for the 1950s, a decade in which he directed only three feature films.  "Around the World" is a good quality DVD and unquestionably the work of Welles, but a ultimately a shadow of what he was capable of.  ---   --- The five episodes on this DVD explore various aspects of European Culture.  Welles takes his camera in search of Basque country, Spanish bullfights, the idiosyncratic denizens of Paris' St Germain des Pres, and the loquacious and venerable Chelsea Pensioners.  The "St Germain des Pres" episode best typifies the offbeat subject matter.  Welles spends most of his time interviewing a commune dweller who makes his own clothes.  After that, Welles dashes through the town, capturing glimpses of celebrities like Jean Cocteau and Eddie Constantine ("Lemmy Caution"), before discovering a group of "Letterists" who are dedicated to (you guessed it) inventing new letters.  ---  --- Unfortunately, Welles' typically low budget and the nature of the subject matter limit his range of cinematic expression.  Despite the exotic and obscure locales, most of the footage consists of relatively static interviews, captured in long takes with obligatory reaction shots of Welles inserted to break up the monotony.  Even the bullfight episode lacks the dynamic footage one might expect; Welles' camera is grounded in the stands, preventing him from getting involved in the action.  Only towards the end of "St. Germain des Pres" and in the second Basque episode does Welles get inventive, developing the active, swirling camera style he employed in films like "Mr. Arkadin."   ---  --- Like a record that's worth owning for one or two songs, "Around the World with Orson Welles" does have one episode that justifies its purchase: the second Basque episode.  True, the first few minutes repeat the introduction from the first Basque show, but after that Welles has a lot of fun interviewing kids playing 'pelote' (a game similar to jai alai).  Welles gets his camera into the pelote action, and seems rejuvenated by the subject matter. An 11-year old boy joins Welles and acts as a tour guide for the rest of the show.  The episode ends dramatically, with Welles quoting a Basque aphorism against a night sky lit by fireworks.  ---   --- For a better example of Welles' creativity in the documentary genre, check out his 1974 essay film, "F for Fake," just released on DVD.  "Around the World with Orson Welles" is a far more pedestrian effort, but it does give Welles fans something to look at while they await the more significant releases that are hopefully on the not-too-distant horizon
Good luck getting this bed! I ordered it 5 months ago (with availability being 2-4 weeks. Each month I was told it will available "next month." I finally cancelled my order and purchased the Little Tykes one before my frustrated 3 yr. old outgrows a toddler bed.  ---  --- Kidkraft needs to focus more on actually manufacturing their products and less on marketing for orders they are unable to fulfill
Another great season of Bewitched. To the horror of Darrin and the joy of Endora baby Tabitha comes into her powers causing all kinds of new chaos from making her toys fly during a photo session, making Aunt Clara think her spells have messed up again, preventing Darrin from leaving for work in Wishcraft. This season marked the second Gladys and second Louise
This monster is great...my old millionaire nan came over recently to tell us that she was about to take us out of her will because we had too much money already, and as luck would have it she had to use the bathroom during that same visit. We heard this scream from the bathroom and when we broke in we found our nan dead on the floor...luckily she hadn't gone to her attorney's office to sign the new will and we got our share after all...thanks toilet monster..you were worth the $15 + $5 shipping we paid for you
If your looking for cheap snorkel equipment this is the way to go, but the fins are low quality and I would only wear them if I wanted to get laughed at
Based upon reviews, I decided to go with Dr. Brown's from the start. We've been very happy with them! A friend had given me some Avent bottles she had never used so I decided to try them & compare. My baby had a terrible tummy ache & had never before burped so much. Those Avents now sit in the back of the cabinet gathering dust. ---  --- For folks who complain about leakage....the rare times that has happened to me was when I accidentally added milk past the top marker. Otherwise, I've never had a single problem with any sort of leakage. ---  --- Another plus is that they're very easy to clean; I just pop all the pieces into the top rack of the dishwasher (I use a toddler basket to hold some of the smaller pieces).  ---  --- If you're comparing the wide mouth to the standard, forget the standard! They're a pain to get liquid into (but still good bottles). ---  --- I absolutely love this product & would never consider another bottle
Our very busy toddler (17 months old) is having a good time with this scooter.  It is very well made especially for the reasonable price.  The wheels do not scratch our wood floors, unlike some of her other toys.  She is our third and we have had our fair share of similar toys.  This one is one of the better ones.  The only down side is that it could be a little lower to the ground.  She is above average height and can just reach the floor well enough to push with her feet.  Our older girls were petitie and this would have been too big for them at the recommended age of 18 months.  Once they are in their twos, our girls have preferred trikes, so I'm also not sure how long this will last as a 'favorite', but it can definately be 'handed -down' or given to friends as it is going to last for years
I bought this tea from a dot-head store.  I'm usually a decaf coffee drinker, but when ill I make this.  I usually put a spoon full in a huge plastic cup (like McDonalds large) with bottled water and heat for 4 minutes in microwave, remove, stir, and strain into large coffee mug.  I ALWAYS have too damn much tea leaves left in cup, but I like it strong.  It'd be nice if there were instructions on how much to use.  BTW, is this stuff decaffeinated
I made the mistake of ordering this product and Microsoft Office 2007 which I didn't realize that it was also offered in Office 2007 which I didn't need 2 of them so I gave the other one to my sister who just loves to keep all her records in the
Neither my husband or i could get into the movie. I dont think i would ever watch this film again. It was not What it was made out to be
My Japanese pen pal Y. Yamamoto just adores Strawberry Pocky and tells me they're lovely icebreakers in stressful situations. ---  --- Mind you, I'm not sure I should believe Yohko-chan as she describes these situations, many of which involve her flying a space battleship and using time travel in a remarkably casula way, but I must admit they're entertaining reading. and the souvenier she sent me from that space Hot Springs was rather interesting -- although why you would make crocodiles that are just like bananas is completely beyond me. ---  --- Still, I want to date her friend Ruuan. She looks hot, in an amazingly ditzy sort of way....
In the instruction pamphlet under Scan Tools, there is a list of what the program scans. ---  --- One of the functions is a Registry Scanner--"This is a fast scanner that analyzes the Windows Registry for traces of known malware." ---  --- The bottom line--I have an infected registry which was discovered by my antivirus program and the Spyware Doctor doesn't know it's there. I do keep Spyware Doctor up to date. ---  --- I'm still looking for an effective spyware application
This tastes more like a chemist's concoction than Peas Paneer. If this is somebody's first acquaintance with Indian cuisine, they would avoid Indian cuisine for the rest of their life.  ---  --- 
I had this sent to my little brother and they threw away the packaging before discovering that they recieved a broken unit, and of course they didn't tell me in a timely fashion.  Shoddy merch is not cool, anything we can do to swap it out is fine, but being over 30 days I guess you win
worked like a champ! I have an RV with tires that require 115 psi. this was not a problem for this compressor. The RV also has an "air ride" system for the axels and the 5th wheel hitch. This compressor had not problem filling the system to the required level. good pric
Long story short.  Bought for daughter for Christmas...it is in the trash...This was THE WORST TOY/DOLL purchase ever
Wow, this l932 camp classic squeezes so much into its running time--S&M, near-nudity, drugs, racism,sex, sex--you're left gasping. Boris Karloff turns in a delightful turn as the menacing Fu Manchu. Myrna  Loy, in her pre-superstar days, is his "horribly ugly" daughter,  who delights in capturing gorgeous hunk, Charles Starrett, and playing with  him like a toy. His nearly nude scenes--when he wears a loose, constantly  shifting diaper--while she runs her long talons over her glistening  torso--must've have accelerated pulses of all sexes back in this pre-Code  extravaganza. Fay Wray should have played Karen Morley's squealing heroine.  Silver-haired and elegant Lewis Stone makes an off-beat hero-adventurer.  Gorgeous photography by Tony Gaudio, comic book costumes by Adrian, art  deco settings by Cedric Gibbons make this a smash-hit from the first frame  to the last. Lots of flesh baring by Charles and the dark slaves. It's fun  to watch Myrna lash her whip over Starrett and her "Nubian"  slaves. Great quote: "Will we ever understand this Eastern race?&quot
The IS-DV only records videos in the 'ASF' format, not MPEG-4.  I bought one from 'egghead.com'.  After 30 days, I contacted Aiptek to tell them the problem, they acknowledged that the IS-DV only records videos in the 'ASF' format.  They said there is nothing they will do about it.  Do not buy this product.  Aiptek advertises that the IS-DV records video in MPEG-4 format, but it doesn't.  'Egghead.com' won't deal with me because they say I should deal with the manufacture after 30 days from the purchase date
I have this program on a 30-day demo.  It might be OK if I didn't mind my computer becoming almost unusable. ---  --- I tried to run the system virus scan, as recommended, but after 3 hours it was only 2% done because it was stuck on a file it couldn't seem to get past.  I skipped the file, but then it quickly got stuck again.  The "time remaining" said it would take 4 days to complete, so I cancelled that scan. ---  --- It has a learning mode that initally blocks EVERYTHING.  Apparently, this program has no brain.  For example, I have the Live Search Toolbar installed in Outlook.  It had to ask me if it was OK to run that dll file.  In fact, each program that called up a process from a shared dll has to ask permission before it could run. ---  --- Don't even get me started on the Quickbooks and Internet Explorer problems.  Which is what it wouldn't let those programs do, even after they had been run and I repeated clicked "allow" over and over. ---  --- Twice today it got so slow running IE that it finally crashed the computer so bad that  I had to do a hard re-boot.  If you have it checking ports on your computer, almost nothing would run or download on IE. ---  --- So, I'm going to demo a few more, but it's probably back to Windows Live OneCare, which I had the past year.  It just doesn't seem to do much (no long list of features), but it also doesn't jam everthing else up
For less than $200 this is a great camera.  It is by no means spectacular, but for the price, it does a good job.  I own a Canon Powershot S60 as well, and the Canon outdoes this camera in some ways, but it's not pocketable.  The F20 is easy to use, the menu interface is fairly simple and self-descriptive, it powers up and is ready to take a picture quickly, and shutter lag seems average (close to the S60).  However, the only way to eliminate shutter lag is to buy a DSLR.  The "anti-shake" mechanism is not really useful at all, it merely boosts the ISO to 2000 which makes the image unprintable (at least indoors).  I have yet to try it this feature outside.  I've also found that dialing down the exposure compensation helps with the lowlights, especially outdoors.  Manually setting the ISO from 100-400 will, I hope, make for more printable, usable pictures.  I had actually thought of returning this little camera, but then realized that I could find nothing, for the price, that would be able to compete. I really wanted a 28mm lens, only found on more expensive models like the Canon sd800is, or Lumix's (which apparently have tons of noise at low ISO's).   It's pocketable, portable, and with a little tinkering you can get what you want from it. 
For people with who need to eat something between meals to keep their blood sugar levels up, these Peanut Butter Balls are a godsend.  Many's the time I've felt the familiar lightheadness and oncoming headache from low blood sugar and been saved by these things.  I always carry one in my pocket or purse, and keep one in the glove compartment.
You get a view into 60's white america. The only people of color in this book are a policeman, and a caricature. I don't have a problem with other Seuss books where they are set in fantasy land and the whole world is make believe. This is set in everyday life, and I think its best left on the bookshelf, it has nothing to offer my child who has and who lives in a world where folks have brown eyes and black hair, not to mention various shades of skin colour. The rhyming is also not entertaining enough to enjoy and makeup for this one-dimensional "white" depiction of the world
The very first DVD player I bought was Sony's very first 5 Disc DVD changer back in 1998. It was an excellent player, but as the technology improved, it could no longer keep up. I upgraded to a single disc Sony which could handle DTS, and later to another single disc player which could handle progressive video. But I always missed the convenience of a 5 disc changer after having been spoiled by one at the start. At about one-third the price of that original DVD changer, this player has all the features of those previous upgrades and more while retaining the familiar functionality of my first player. It produces an excellent picture, has lots of tweakable settings, has more outputs, and is also very stylish looking. ---  --- I do have a couple of nits, though. My original DVD changer had buttons on the remote which allowed me to jump directly to whichever disc I wanted. With this one, I have to press a Disc Skip button to cycle through all the discs until I reach the one I want. The front of the player does have direct access buttons, though. I wish I still had my old remote control as I'm sure it would work with this unit to restore that remote functionality. ---  --- Second, the upscaling through HDMI produces a great image, but not really any better than leaving the image at 720x480p. In fact, upscaling will sometimes magnify some interlacing artifacts visible in the picture. It's also unfortunate that while connected through HDMI, progressive scan cannot be turned off. This shouldn't be an issue most of the time, but there are some video sources that might look better with it turned off. Progressive settings can only be changed on the unit itself and not through the remote, but they cannot be turned off when connected through HDMI.  ---  --- One last thing about the HDMI connection. There can sometimes be a noticeable audio sync issue when using HDMI connections and digital TVs. This is not a problem with the player, but with the way HDMI is currently implemented. This player has an audio-sync adjustment feature which should compensate for the problem. However, the audio-sync adjustment doesn't work if the player is connected to a receiver via its optical digital outputs. Since I need to have mine connected this way in order to enjoy 5.1 sound, the audio-sync adjustment feature is useless here. And that's a shame. By the way, there should be no audio-sync issues if the player is connected via component, s-video, or composite outputs. ---  --- There's also a minor thing I've found about all my Sony DVD players that I haven't liked. They are unable to correctly display Time Remaining on certain discs, or more commonly on the special features (documentaries, etc.) on certain discs. I also have a cheapo Philips player which has no problems displaying Time Remaining on those things (even on the menu). It's an improvement I'd really like to see implemented on future players. ---  --- Now, despite the complaints I've listed above, don't get me wrong. This is still an excellent player and I really love it. I happily recommend it to anyone considering purchasing it. It really is a great value and it performs very well in most instances, and I feel it's the best DVD player I've ever owned. It's just not quite perfect. In all likelihood, it's also the last DVD player I'll ever own as I'll probably be buying a BluRay or other HD player in a couple of years when that format war is over. But this is a great player to hold me over until then
this cover worked great - kept the windshield dry & ice free during the last snowstorm
For $99 this should be a much better remote.  If you watch movies in the dark, you have to use the glow button, guess what, you will have to replace the batteries once a month at least.  Also, Logitech has over simplifed the remote.  You can't program individual buttons you have to use their program that only allows you to program devices and not the remote directly.  If you have to go into the device menu  a lot you will not be able to control the volume unless you switch to the device that controls volume.  Why not have an option to program each button period...  But the remote is useless now because of the low battery life.  Do not buy this unless you want to buy batteries every month.  Ridiculous.  Only remote I have ever had like this
This is a great product. The only area of improvement would be the belt clip. It is very difficult to attach to the belt. Over all it is a great case
Holy cow, I was ready to rip my hair out after listening to this. Horrible, sophomoric, insipid... YUK. This is like Chinese water torture. drip drip drip on and on. YAAAGGGHHHH
This is not the health magazine you'd expect from Martha Stewart -- it's extremely heavy on advertisements (45% at my rough count), and really cluttered, and just not "good". The recipes are interesting,  if you can find them among the aromatherapy and skin-hydration ads
Leave it to me to start into a series in its' second, third, or fourth installments. In this case, it's the fourth. Course, there's a good explanation why. I set out looking for Final Fantasy I&II: Dawn of Souls for my Gameboy Advance(Hey, if you're going to collect a series, it's a good thing to start at the beginning) at my local videogame store but they only had Final Fantasy IV Advance so I decided to get it instead. There isn't much that I can say that hasn't already been said by the other reviewers here about Final Fantasy IV Advance.The story goes like this..The kingdom of Baron is on a quest to collect all the elemental crystals. The commander of its air force, Cecil, has been dismissed after questioning the king's motives. With the help of others; Cecil sets out to stop the growing threat and, in the meantime, uncovers a far more dangerous one. It's a deep story with alot of twists and turns & is a deeply challenging game due to the Active Time Battle system. I can't recommend this game enough. It's one of my all-time favorite Final Fantasy games.  ---  --- Although they tweaked the graphics, translation and whatnot abit, they pretty much made the game as it was originally. I think Final Fantasy fans as well as casual RPG gamers will really enjoy this one.
Another Viva La Rice Ready to eat product that is delicious with just the right amount of flavor and great texture! I don't know how they do it but it is just right in size to take to work, camping, or to have at home
Fine cut, diamond texture whatever, it's missing the thing vital to really be popcorn salt and that is the flavor that true popcorn salt has. Slightly buttery, very strong, and always good. There;s a trend lately to re-lable regular salt as popcorn salt, this trend needs to stop
With King Creole, Love Me Tender and Stay Away Joe - JAILHOUSE ROCK 1957 is Elvis Presley at his best. He declined the old musical tradition of MGM and insisted on a contemparary look - especially how the choreography should be executed. ---  --- In this film we see ELVIS PRESLEY at his very best. He was a stunning actor - much more prefer HIM to James Dean...  It`s a shame he made more or less 33 forgettable films.... only a handful stands out and JAILHOUSE ROCK is the best.  It isn`t a classic - it isn`t even great. But we have ELVIS - the KING - and that`s the best there is:-))
I'm sorry, but these just weren't for me, they have somewhat of a stale taste. I recommend buying a single bag before buying a case if you are at all hesitant
I was happily surprised with the weight and durability of the grill cover. It looks like it will withstand the winter and keep my grill clean and safe. The Velcro straps help secure the cover tightly to the grill
Given high acclaims this film has collected over time, I was glad to pick up a VHS copy at my local library sale.  Began to watch it last night.  I was able to sit thru the part 1.  When the tape ended, I was actually glad. I felt a sense of acomplishment in finishing the part 1!  The movie is DREARY to the max.  People portrayed are irrational, lost, uncommunicative, and subject to random and cruel violence by soldiers and rulers.  In some way, this movie reminded me of the dreary winter (lasting 6 months!) I spent in Russia a couple of years ago...  ---  --- To me, the movie reflects the psychological breakdown that happened after the decades long terror policy of Soviet state (1920-1956).  For survivors, nothing made any sense anymore, except perhaps fear and evil, as people in this dreary film reflects.  People have been already destroyed in their souls.  They are psychologically shattered beyond repair and only occasional readings of the Bible verses give them any sense of permanence in their chaotic daily experience.  ---  --- Maybe that is the real meaning of this movie.  To really reflect what happened to people's psyche after Lenin and Stalin's UNLIMITED TERROR, they found a parallel in Mongol's devastation and oppression of medieval Russia.  In both cases, people were left shattered, helpless, irrational, withdrawn,  and autistic.  
It is very difficult to attach it to anything. The straps are to short and under strange angel. My son did not play with it
I think that this crib toy is awesome! Since my son was 3 months old we've turned it on every night at bedtime for him. He just watches the fishies swim around while the lights dance and the music plays. My son is now 7 months old and he still seems to like it.  And the cool thing is that now he is old enough to be able to interact with it.  If I switch it to manual MODE, he can turn on the music himself!  He can also play with the crackling feet and feel the silky material. Plus, he has another friend to keep him company in his crib (a big happy turtle with fish in his belly :-). Thus far, the straps haven't broken or cracked and I have removed it from the crib a couple of times. Also, the fish do swim around and the music does last for 15 minutes.  Its just a matter of which MODE you switch it to. (Reading the instructions really helps.) I strongly recommend this
I bought these for a friend for Christmas as she is a butterfly lover.They ar beautiful. Dainty yet elegant.She loved them. It was hard for me to give them up
Very pleased with all aspects of this transaction. Price, delivery and quality all excellent. Recommend seller highly
I notice several other reviews mentioning faulty/defective consoles arriving. Well, I received my first Schwinn 438 about a month ago. I put it all together, and realized they did not ship an AC adapter with the machine. I contacted Amazon, they told me to either send the machine back for another or contact the manufacturer. I contacted the manufacturer on Saturday, they were closed. I contacted them the following Monday and they told me the item was on back order, but, I could buy a compatible adapter from Radio Shack. I did. I came home excited to use my elliptical, unfortunately, the console did nothing but beep at me..very frustrating. I contacted the manufacturer again, they advised me that the console was on backorder and would not be delivered for at least 2 months. They recommended I send the unit back to Amazon for a replacement. I did so. I spent the better part of a night taking the thing apart and repackaging it...quite a job trying to squeeze it back in the box. About 3 weeks later, I received my second elliptical. Same faulty console problem, after spending another couple of hours putting the thing together. Contacted Amazon and demanded a full refund and return. They did pick the unit up, and did not make me take it all apart this time, but, I am still awaiting a full refund. I have since purchased a Vision Fitness elliptical from a real fitness shop in my area. I am extremely happy with the unit, although it was a few hundred bucks more. This was one horrific experience with Amazon. I wouldn't recommend buying this product, seems like they are shipping out defective units
I discovered the Murad Acne Complex Kit about six years ago and have been using it since... It cleared my acne up within weeks and has kept the acne away. Some products I tried dried my skin out but Murad Acne Complex leaves it feeling clean and hydrated without all the chemical smells. I recommend anyone with acne try Murad Acne Complex to see if it will work as well for you. --- 
ANother hot release, top 5 in 2005 so far. No one even metions track 7 produced by one and only El-Producto and track 8 by belief. Hot cd recommend to those who don't listin to bull

bought this watch as a gift i was not disapointed another great vaule from amazo
When I first heard of this game, I basically ignored it. Then, when I was visiting Gamestop one day, I decided to buy it. I was instantly amazed by the unique battle system, the bright and cheerful backdrops, (except for Twilight Town, that is) and the challenging and profound gameplay.  --- I have not played the first one, but I will probably get it from the virtual console on Wii. --- One problem with the game is that it's too short
I've owned and use the Sony 256MB Memory Stick Pro pictured (in black), and currently also use a 1GB Sony Memory Stick Pro. I've not had any problems with them, formatting or otherwise, over long periods of heavy use. OK, a little pricier than, say, SD cards, but a good quality product for Sony digital cameras.
Between the amended "politically correct" ending to this famous tale and the so-very-hokey interaction between Kirstey Alley and Lloyd Bridges, I couldn't wait for this to be over! The animation was very poor quality... the music was not the focus, my grandchildren lost interest. Shat else could possibly have been wrong
I am very satisfied by this short sword and by its cutting abilities. The sheath however is very soft and prevents the sword from quickly putting in it
Color shown as natural is far from accurate. I am unhappy with color and may return these
The chain was MUCH thicker than I expected. And it's pretty obvious that it isn't real silver. But, if you want some cheap metal bling, this will do it.
So I decided maybe I'll give this exploitation thing a try considering I love gore,violence, and horror movies. The reason I give it a 1 star is because it just isn't that good of a movie. It's VERY boring for most of the movie. About the first 20 or so minutes few words are even said. Then the guys just rape this woman several times, then she comes back for a very unsatisfying revenge. It's very slow paced and doesn't live up to the hype. It isn't all that gory, and it isn't scary either. Also, the rape isn't that convincing. I'm not saying I need everything shown in detail, but the acting is so bad it makes it seem as if its not even a big deal. Oh, and the woman gets revenge on one of the men who raped her...and he was practically mentally retarded. The guy really just fell in with the wrong crowd and they convinced him to do something bad. That is not grounds for what she did to him, which in my opinion was the worst of the killings. Anyways. not that good of a movie, don't let the lure of sleaze and violence make you think it will be worth your time because its not
My camera has broken in less than one year of owning it.  Because I received it as a gift I don't have the proof of purchase so Kodak will not fix my camera for no cost.  What a lemon the CX7300 is.  First of all it takes pictures so delayed you never really get a good candid picture.  What's broken?  I can take one picture before the batteries go dead.  I change the batteries, one picture.  Change the batteries again, one picture
I am a huge Special K fan. Especially Red Berry, but at heart I am a chocoholic. I was so excited to hear they had a chocolate version and I ran right out to try it. It is your average Special K flakes but with the addition of "Chocolate Pieces". The problem is they leave a horrible waxy coating in your mouth because of the poor quality chocolate. I am sure this is because it has to stay healthy but I would rather have a Fat Free Chocolate Jello 100 calorie pack then deal with the feeling it leaves in your mouth. So back to red berry for me
I bought this for a boy of 12 who goes to school in German.  He speaks English at home with his mother.  I think that  this game  will help him with his English
Unbelievably and indubitably a bona fide, and fortified roots reggae album! If you don't have Firehouse Rock in your CD collection and you consider yourself a reggae fan, you may need to re-evaluate what you think you know about Jamaican music. The Roots Radics, especially the rythym section, utilize (with supreme efficacy, I might add) and epitomize the manipulation of space and time so often associated with reggae "riddims." On top of the Radics, the Wailing Souls add ethereal vocals, while staying masterfully conscious. Firehouse Rock is a beautifully recorded piece of audible Jamaican history and an absolute must have
It is great! you have to buy it, believe me. Don't waste your time looking for another case, this is the best
I REALLY,REALLY HATE FOREIGNER AND I RANK THEM AS BAD AS GREEN DAY.DONT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF BUYING THIS DISGUSTINGLY AWFUL CD WHICH CONTAINS TRASH LIKE WAITING FOR A GIRL LIKE YOU WHICH HAS TO BE ONE OF THE MOST MORONIC AND STUPID SONGS EVER.GET ANY LED ZEPPELIN ALBUM INSTEAD
 --- I suspect that the phrase mentioned in the title of my review (which I saw in the description of the product) was Amazon's idea since most (if not all) of the label information is easily found on Nature Made's own website  www.NatureMade.com.   ---  --- There you will find that several of the components are synthetic (not necessarily bad, but I like to know), and also that Amazon is near the top in selling price of the 6 listed online retailers for this particular product.   ---  --- Ain't it just amazing what the web can teach you?   Thanks Amazon! :) --- 
Bought this to convert PAL Hi-8 (Canon) purchased years ago in Singapore for Mac (PowerBook G4, Tiger OS-X) nonlinear editing. Worked perfectly the first time, only needed to set a single switch to select PAL. No need for software drivers etc. Happily plugged and played with the Mac and the camcorder. ---  --- Acceptable price for the features and ease of use.
I've purchased this locally and it was delicious, so I was happy to see a deal offered by Amazon. Unfortunately, it never made it to my door. UPS reported that the sauce was leaking out of the box and returned the package to Amazon.  This seems to match what many other reviewers said.
Bought three different kits, small to amuse the grandkids when they visit, medium to keep handy for next needed gift occasion. and El Grande for a X-Mas gift for the kids.  The pens looked great on TV but didn't work at all when we tried to use them.  Dried out too quickly, never mixed the colors so was a very huge dollar amount for low quality markers.  Also, didn't notice small print that the El Grande kit MIGHT come in a brown cardboard box--IT DID, I bet all El Grande kits came that way.  Looked terrible!
This commentary has many tremendous insights into the book of Romans.  Romans is one of the richest resources of truth within the Bible and John Stoot does a good job of unpacking it.  The book is written from a framework of the reader having a strong prior understanding of the Scriptures.  It is probably not considered a highly scholarly work, but it is not for the average reader to pick up for light reading either
I have tried a dozen screen guards, some of them shine a lot, some of them are not as clear as they promise, some take like 2 hrs to stick on the screen without any air bubble. This makes its way through all that problems. Well on the other hand it does have a catch --- 1. Finger print magnet --- 2. The price - THAT PRICE FOR ONE!!! --- And yea the best part is its static not gum, and its washable.
A fast card which works as expected. --- You don't know the difference a fast card can make, unless you swap to a slower one. Even a slower camera/device will have improved performance with a faster card such as this one. ---  --- Enjoy
Compared to the Olive & Aloe bar, this one seems to lather better
One of the best-directed films of 2006, "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" is built for multiple viewings and perhaps for cult audiences.   ---  --- And even though "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" may require multiple viewings just to catch all of the rapid-fire dialogue, or to untangle the plot, one of the best reasons for multiple viewings is to admire the directorial skill:  It's a Class-A tutorial for amateur filmmakers or simply armchair film-buffs who will appreciate the highwire juggling act that Shane Black pulls off here, with "KKBB"'s sudden shifts of tone from slapstick to dead-serious drama to gallows-comedy. ---  --- If that seems like an easy feat, well... Remember "1941"?  Not even Spielberg got it right.  But Shane Black nails it here -- and it's his directorial debut. ---  --- Downey & Kilmer are also at the top of their game here, but it's Michelle Monaghan who impresses with a flat-out great performance that keeps up with the veterans. ---  --- "Sui Generis" (one-of-a-kind) is the phrase that best describes "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang," although it's remarkably mainstream at times.  It's a showcase of talents for everyone involved, and when the bullets aren't flying, there's even a romantic comedy here & social commentary to boot.  I can't think of any other film quite like it -- and that's just how the Warner Brothers tradition seems to work (at its best). --- 
(it?)I have many of David and Japan's albums, but this thinly composed album is repetitive, boring and annoying. I think there were some hidden tracks too, but I just wanted the album to be over. You are better off with "Dead Bees on a Cake" , "Secrets of the Beehive" or any bee related titled album of his
I was also disappointed that the product came without a DVD, though the initial description said so. But Amazon has given me the refund of the whole purchase price. Appreciate their gesture.  ---  --- Agree with previous reviewer that the pump is really hard to work with. It took a *lot* of time to get the ball inflated and the pump got hot meanwhile. ---  --- Yeah, not very happy with this product. ---  --- p.s: Contrastingly, had a bad experience with Dell on a similar situation when I bought a Nikon camera. Dell blamed the wrong description on Nikon and expectedly, Nikon blamed Dell. Neither owned up the error. But Amazon was pretty good. I really appreciate it
this is great if you're a hobbyist.  or a maker of hotel..no motel paintings. --- sucks if you're not
I have an Amazon bookmark that advertises Ludlum's book "The Sigma Protocol". It says "In Ludlum's latest, an ordinary man battles a global conspiracy." Well gee. That's the plot of THIS book as well. Come to think of it, that's the plot of every book by the man that I've read. A 'vast right wing conspiracy' is set to take over the world. They have small armies, a lot of money and a plan. This time around, a group of military men (naturally) plan to foment terror, and use the chaos to implement their vision of the world (laugh not - millions in the Middle East and far Left believe 9-11 was something along the same lines). Enter "ordinary man" Joel Converse. He's a Vietnam vet and P.O,W. who thought he had left that life far behind. It's up to him to save the world. He will survive certain death several times (the bad guys always seem to think they need him alive, and they just HAVE to explain their conspiracy to this total stranger). He will find love, and he'll visit several European cities to boot. Of course, a suspension of disbelief is essential for many novels (how else would you believe that a Nazi and an Israeli are on the same side?), but Ludlum's cliched stories are further worsened by the fact that he just couldn't write. His dialogue writing is always tedious, and sometimes just painful to read. Action scenes are generic. The only thing he could do right is character background, but that's not enough to save this. "The Aquitaine Progression" might make a half decent TV movie, but to endure 700 pages is just too much
Works great out of the box. Some reviews mentioned problems with the CD but mine worked fine but took some time to start on the first try.  It mounted easly under the upper kitchen cabinet.  No problem with signal strength happy to say since the unit it replaced had problems.  The brightness of the digital clock is adjustiable and I use it as a night light in the kitchen.  The remote control is powerful enough to control the unit from accross the room and adheres to the refrigerater (magnet) with my wife useing it to hang things.  This is a Thomson Inc product (purchased the GE & RCA names several years ago) that makes TV's ect. --- I am very happy with the product and recommend it
This coat was listed as camel, but when it arrived it was actually tan.  Even the tag says tan.  I was disappointed because it was the only Christmas gift that I had for my husband.  I never would have ordered a tan.  Also the coat fit like a whole size larger.  I had to return it and it has been well over a month and I still have not received my refund
I have 3 Danelectro Fab effects pedals. The sound I get from this overdrive pedal is much more than I thought I'd get for my starter collection. A couple, more expensive effects I purchased, made by another brand, don't seem to be any better than the Danelectro Fab. ---  --- The casing is a heavy duty plastic, not metal so I'm not sure how well it would hold up to stage use or someone with a heavy foot.  ---  --- As for the comment about this pedal being a waste of time by another reviewer, most guitarists already know that they need to purchase an AC adaptor for a power source. Consider it a learning experience. Once you buy the adapter be sure to pick up a multi-plug cable if you want more than one effects pedal. This allows you to hook up several more plugs to the one AC adaptor. I now have 5 effects pedals hooked up to one energy source. Bought mine at The Guitar Center so I don't know if Amazon carries them. ---  --- Radio waves are everywhere and travel great distances depending on the tower they come from. I used to get a woman talking to truckers over her CB radio through my stereo. Talk to a friend who is an electrical engineer or someone at an electronics store about suggestions to cut down on or eliminate radio interference
Though this movie is not the stage version, it is just as good! --- Bill Benson(Bing Crosby) and Ted Adams (Donald O Conner) decide to do a broadway show together. However, they need a leading lady. Well Ted and the director decide that if Bill should run across the right girl, sign her. So Bill sets off to Paris, and Ted for London. Well Bill discovers a girl(Mitzy Gaynor) not knowing that Ted found and signed a girl in Paris (Jeanmaire). --- When the two find out it is total chaos, especially trying to keep the two girls from finding out about eachother on the way home. All the while trying to get the other to tell their girl to leave. Things seem to be going fine, until the two men begin to fall in love with eachothers leading lady!  --- The movie has GREAT Porter songs De Lovely, Anything Goes, Second Hand Turban, Blow Gabe Blow, I get a kick out of you, You're the Top, and a fabulous tap number with Donald: You Can Bounce Right Back. Phil Harris also stars in this fantastic, De Lovely movie!!
I ordered this bike for my granddaughters 4th birthday.  The first shipment arrived on schedule, but the box was total destroyed and without opening you could see that the bike was scratched and dented.  Delivery was refused and another bike was sent.  The 2nd bike arrived, with the box being in less than perfect condition, but delivery was accepted.  When my son started assembling the bike, he found that several of the parts had been assembled at the factory incorrectly and he could not assemble the bike.  The bike was returned for a credit and we went and purchased a similar bike locally.  We still have not received a credit for the return of the bike.  I am very disappointed and will not purchase from this vendor again
Unfortunately, for all the name brand that this book conveys, I think the cover seems to be the most intriguing part.  There are much better ways for book peddling and the fact that a firm such as McKinsey allowed their name on the title of a book for the sake of a few sales, boggles this readers mind.  The subject matter seems to be along the lines of the bull session with all bull and no session.  No actual quantitative analysis is used throughout the book, and if anything more than an encyclopedic definition is learned from this book, I would be astounded.  Save some money and go search online for some basic books on beginning valuation.  By the way, those giving 5 stars either can't read English very well or are shills for McKinsey
I bought some of this for my husband last Christmas with a stovetop popcorn popper (the kind with the stir rod.)  Now it's our favorite brand of popcorn and our favorite way to make it.  The packages come with pre-measured oil & popping corn and you just cook it all up.  Each box has 5 bags.  Each bag makes a big bowl (?20 cups?)  We only have to add salt and we love the taste.  I highly recommend this with a stir rod popper, too--either the stovetop or electric kind. 
I caught some of this on PBS and was beyond appalled that they chose to cast Reba McEntire as Nellie.  Musicals are for people that can sing, not whine and slide their way up to the preferred pitch.  I'm a native of Arkansas, by the way, and it hurts my ears to listen to Reba's voice.  Reba's country treatment of the vocals shows exactly how talentless she is
This is a great cot.  It is low profile, and made of strong materials.  I was worried about the wire legs, but they are very, very strong.  So strong that it takes some muscle to get them into their holes in the frame.  This might be a drawback for someone who is weak in the arms.  It folds up easy and is very portable.  Also, I have a smaller frame, and although this cot is perfect for me, a larger frame person might want to consider a wider version for comfort in the shoulder area.  You won't be disappointed in this one for the money
ABOUT TIME URBAN WORKS BRINGS BACK "THE COSBY SHOW", BUT I WONDER, WHAT HAPPENED TO "A DIFFERENT WORLD" AFTER THE RELEASE CANCELLATION OF SEASON 2? --- IF ANY WORKER OF URBAN WORKS READS THIS,PLEASE REPLY!!!!
Received the monitor quickly.  It works well.  The automatic feature is great. 
I remember playing this game as a kid. --- Im sure glad someone still makes it. --- Good family fu
My title says it all - I was really disappointed with this camera, but before I get into the specifics as to why, I must mention a few things first.  This was my third camera in the Exilim line - prior to purchasing Z850 I have owned Z60, as well as Z600.  Both were great cameras.  I mean, what's not to like?  Clean, sexy look; easy to use; great picture quality.  But having to work for Kodak in the past, I decided that I want to get more involved with the world of digital photography and post processing, and in order to do that I needed something with a little more manual control, so I sold my Z600, and got a Z850 instead.  Big mistake!  I ordered it directly from Amazon, and it was a brand new camera.  Right of the bat I got a defective unit!  The problem - it was very inconsistent at taking sharp pictures, especially close-ups.  The shots were blurry for the most part, and the colors were a bit off as well.  How is that for quality and reliability?!  But I thought to myself, "it's okay, it happens", so I returned it back to Amazon (thanks to their great return policy), and got myself another one, this time from TechToysForLess (it was a lot cheaper comparing to Amazon).  One thing to be aware of - TechToysForLess sells what it's called "grey market" cameras.  I knew about it ahead of time, but someone might not, and then be unpleasantly surprised.  For those who don't know what it is - the "grey market" refers to the flow of new goods through distribution channels other than those authorized or intended by the manufacturer.  Only new products fall under the legal, accepted definition of grey market.  Grey market goods are being sold outside of normal distribution channels by companies which may have no relationship with the producer of the goods.  Frequently this form of parallel import occurs when the price of an item is significantly higher in one country than another. This situation commonly occurs with cigarettes and electronic equipment, such as cameras.   Entrepreneurs buy the product where it is available cheaply, often at retail but sometimes at wholesale, import it legally to the target market and sell it at a price which provides a profit but which is below the normal market price there.  So, the product is legal, it's new, and it's cheap.  BUT... In some instances, there could be minor differences between the "authorized" product, and the "grey market" one.  For example, a "grey" Z850 doesn't have an eBay mode, but offers an "Auction" mode instead.  It's a bit different with respect to settings.  Also, there is no full blown manual in the box, but rather a short "how to" instruction in various languages.  However, the full manual can be found on a CD-ROM.  Another difference, and that's actually a plus I think, is that it comes with a European power adapter, whereas American sold models don't have that.  The biggest concern with "grey market" products, however, is that in some cases manufacturer will refuse to honor the warranty, so you have to be aware of that, and check before buying.  I knew all of the above, but still took a chance, mainly because the price difference was significant, but also because TechToysForLess had a 10-day return policy, and I thought that it would be enough time for me to "explore" the camera and find out whether it's defective or not.  In any case, I placed an order, and three days later held a new Z850 in my hands.  I didn't waste any time, and when the battery was fully charged, I started taking shots left and right.  All of them were crisp, clear, and sharp, so I knew the unit was good, and the lens wasn't defective as it was with the previous one I had.  However, and I noticed it right away because I tend to take mostly pictures of people, the colors were a bit "warm".  What I mean is there was a slight cast of "pink" present in all pictures.  You wouldn't notice it in pictures of architecture, food, or nature, but people's skin tone looked somewhat unnatural, and it was very obvious.  Neither Z60, nor Z600 had that problem.  I still kept the camera though because I could take care of it by doing some minor editing/post processing.  What finally made me gave it up (I sold it on eBay), was the Casio's ignorance and unresponsiveness to the fact that it had a "broken" movie mode.  The original firmware, version 1.0, that the camera came with had a problem with "stair stepping" - the movies were "jerky", and "noisy".  After numerous complaints by the customers, Casio released two new firmware versions, 1.1, and 1.1B that supposedly "fixed" the movie issue.  But what they in fact did was just "cripple" it - the movie angle was cut by 40% in version 1.1B, and the picture quality actually got worse!  Version 1.1 didn't actually fix anything, but rather "improved" already decent picture quality, and added support for high capacity memory cards.  Also, I've heard from a lot of people that even if those cameras function properly in the beginning, there is a big chance that they will brake later due to poor quality.  I didn't want to wait to find out, so I got rid off it. ---  --- I didn't do my usual Pros and Cons type of review in this case, and from above comments it might seem like there is nothing positive about this camera, but it actually does have a few good things.  For one, in addition to its big, super-bright display, it has a viewfinder!  A big plus in my opinion, especially when shooting outdoors in direct sunshine.  Also, on top of its numerous preprogrammed  Best Shots, it has some manual controls, giving you even more flexibility.  It's a nice little camera.  Unfortunately, it lacks in two important departments - quality and reliability.  I wish I could say that I enjoyed using it, but it was more of a hassle than fun. ---  --- However, I still stand behind Casio products.  After I sold Z850, I got myself a P700 model, which has been discontinued for some time now, and is virtually impossible to find anywhere.  It's a semi-pro model, and offers even more manual controls than Z750/Z850 models.  Excellent camera!  A true performer!  Built like a tank, has a sharp Canon lens, and made in Japan for a change! (all other Exilim models are made in China, which could be the reason for poor quality)  I've used P700 for a couple of months, and... sold it :-)  Yep... Call me crazy, call me whatever you want - I just decided that I want even MORE manual control and flexibility, so I got myself Panasonic DMC-LX2.  One word - Wow!  What a camera!  Optical Image Stabilization, Wide Angle Leica Lens, RAW format are just to name a few of many features of this truly great little gem of a camera.  I've had it only for 2 days now, but I'm already in love with it.  Don't forget to check my review of it, which is coming shortly.  I didn't completely abandon Casio's though - my present to my wife for Valentine's Day this year - Casio EX-S770 in Red color.  I'm definitely going to get my hands on it also, so come back for another review soon.  Once again, I hope I've provided you with some help in your camera purchasing decisions.  Good luck
I thought they might've improved the HGM 15 model. --- Forget about it. --- Both models are lousy. --- Buy foreign.  It might work better
This is a good holster for my V220. It doesnt hang up on me as much as the erson who last reviewed it did. For a holster i give it 4 stars because its function is to hold the cell phone in place on your belt. One problem i have with it is that it holds the phone down by where the strap should be, so having a strap on it wouldnt work too well. and also because it holds it where the strap is, it adds a little wear to that area. Other than that its a good holster for the price. And thats another one of my problems. I paid 14 dollars for this at my local mall, which was highly over priced for my standards. Amazon seems like a great place to buy it, but if you search for Motorola V220 Phone Accessories, then you can find a site with free shipping for it, and its 7 bucks. Theres also another site that has it for 3 bucks, but with shipping. I trust amazons shipping though. So if you want a functional holster, get this one
These work great initially...I bought six of them. Of the six, four broke. One stopped altogether, one stopped oscillating, and the other 2 would only work on 1 speed. I bought them in May and they broke after 2, 3, and 4 months, respectively. They are expensive fans, and I was extremely disappointed in their lack of durability. They were used at night by adults and were not moved around at all.  I have had a floor fan for 15 years and it still works without a hitch. These are cheaply put together and your money would be better spent on a fan with a better warranty (this is 1 year)and higher quality components.
I tried $50-$60 sets from Regent (who apparently also does Spalding), Franklin, and Sportcraft, and only got a usable set by combining parts from 2 sets (alternately, one should check out manufacturer part replacement policies in advance, including who pays Shipping costs).  Regent and Sportcraft had several handles with too few threads, inviting breakage. Franklin wood and threads were such that 1 mallet's threads stripped when tightening by hand, and 1 had poor threads because the wood narrowed and flattened.  Some Sportcraft end caps rolled under, and they claimed their 2 ¾" balls were 3" (if they were rounding, why don't they round their 3 5/16" balls as well?).   Franklin's stakes had different tapers, and about 1/16" different diameters.  On the personal preference front, Sportscraft's handles are grooved, Franklin's balls are, and their wickets are narrow.  Regent's colors are dull
I found it on sale- luckily because it did not work. Cute as the dickens and came with a great strap and the art program was fun for the kids- but no go on the camera. Never able to get it to power up- yes fresh batteries too. We were very disappointed :
Absolutely loved this snap on cover for my new motorola razr v3m.  Fits perfectly. 
I tried to watch this twice. To see what the hype was. I fell asleep both times. Not funny just slow, boring, and stupid. WAY OVERATED
I've been consistently impressed by the Bionicle toys from Lego, and the Rahkshi are no exception.  Wish I was young enough to actually play with this stuff.  Sigh.  Anyway, Rahkshi take the Bionicle can-sold figures to new a new level of articulation.  In total, joints are found at the neck, shoulder, wrist, hip, knee, and ankle, and the crank on the back swivels the entire arm assembly from side to side so you can whack things with the staff-like weapon each of the Rahkshi weilds.  Then there's  the opening case on the back so you can flip spooky little rubber leech/slug things through the air.  Each one of these things appears to come with a miniature CD full of Quicktime promotional stuff for the toys, game, web site, etc.  The voice is a bit melodramatic, but it's still kind of neat.  I like the 360-degree rotating model of the toy you just bought...sort of redundant, since you can look at the one in real life, but nifty all the same.  One thing that mildly disappointed me is that the Rahkshi's weapon isn't really an independanly existing object - which is to say that the bar held between the "hands" is only attached to the hands, not the heads of the weapon.  This isn't a really big deal, except that it means you can't have the figure hold the weapon in only one hand.  This could be rectified with 2 small technic pieces, of course, but it does mean you'd have to add extra bits to the set from somewhere else.  Overall, a very cool build-it-yourself action figure that could either be set to stand looming on your monitor at work, or actually played with.  Educational value is limited to following instructions and demonstration of structural principles, as in any Lego set.  Durability seems good so far - Lego is pretty sturdy stuff
The individual packaging is nice but the floss breaks frequently nexcessitating more than one to floss your teath.  The Glide products are much nicer
As other reviewers mentioned, the display does not update when using the bleed valve and you have to wait at least 10 seconds between readings.  It may be accurate, but dropping overpressure tires to a desired level ends up being a several-minute guessing and waiting game.  Calling it a "racing" gauge is ridiculous
I imagine this movie might be funny if you're really into dog shows.  I'm not, so I couldn't tell you.  Mediocre at best.  "This is Spinal Tap" was better
I know that American milk has been suffering from quality issues for the past few decades. Many american milks are catching up in initial quality and now have better warranties than foreign milks. Yes, union wages and pensions have driven up the cost of American milk, but hey, we're talking about cows jobs here people! Buy American!
This is perhaps my favorite Photography magazine. The printing is fantastic as is the subject matter. I really like the fact there are no ads in it at all. So many photography mags are just an extended catalog for B&H or Adorama that this is a breath of fresh air. ---  --- The photography itself is second to none. Always something interesting and fresh
The slippers are great!  They do seem to be on the large side of a 15.  My husband had to put paper in the toes.  He wears 15 in every thing else
This toys purpose is to sort your change, and it performs poorly. In mine, the quarters get stuck unless you pour coins in one by one, which takes forever. If you pour more than one coin in they get stuck or little coins fall into the slots for bigger coins. In mine the quarter got stuck in the dime slot blocking it, it no longer works
I purchased this and spent 3 days on the phone with Hewlett Packard trying to get the correct adapter so it would fit my R818 camera (the dock has a thin port, roughly 10 connectors) while the R818 has a mini USB plug). ---  --- HP was less than helpful when it came to trying to get the correct adapter, getting a different answer each time I spoke to a different rep (even being told at one point that no supervisors were working).  I was finally able to get someone willing to send me one, but said it was going to be 10+ business days to get it, which by then I'll be on vacation (and I purchased it well in advance giving myself time to get the adapter, thinking it was not hard to get).  I was looking forwared to using the dock on my vacation. ---  --- I would definately *not* recommend this if you have the Photosmart R818 digital camera, unless you like the stress of spending hours on the phone with Hewlett Packard trying to get a correct part, and waiting 10+ business days to get it
A woman that is passionate about beautiful things writes this review.  I am an avid do-it-yourselfer and love to do things around the house.   This magazine has been one of my favorites for years.  I look forward to each new issue and the decorating ideas that it will provide. ---  --- This magazine concentrates on upscale decorating, architecture and landscapes.  Many of the articles feature European country looks.  The photographs in this magazine are absolutely beautiful.    ---  --- The July / August 2006 edition contained the following: ---  --- 1. Venetian Villa (Adrienne Vittadini in Sarasota Florida) --- 2. Nantucket Renewal (Enlarging a Classic Cottage) --- 3. Blooming Intensity (Saturated with Color) --- 4. Coastal Hues (Seaside Radiance Captured) --- 5. British Accent (This side of the Pond) --- 6. The Art of Dining --- 7. The View from Veranda (Summer Place) --- 8. Tableaux (Staged Elegance) --- 9. Personal Luxury (Cool Coral) --- 10. On Exhibit (Jungles in Paris) --- 11. Trade Secrets (Summertime:  Fabrics, Rugs, Lighting) --- 12. Passions (Birds of Paradise: Home Aviary Design) --- 13. Showcase (Summer Seating:  For Pool and Porch) --- 14.  Verdant Paths (Annevoie:  Belgium's Water Garden) --- 15. The Last Word (Vanity Flair:  Adrienne Vittadini Sketchbook) ---  --- There are many photographs of this magazine of both house interiors and exteriors that I find to be very inspirational from a decorating perspective.  If you are looking for either painting or decorating ideas this magazine has much to offer.  I have replicated some of the interiors in my own home.   ---  --- The exterior photographs of this magazine are always very appealing.  I have been slowing changing the landscaping on my property to reflect a more Italian way of life.  I think you will be inspired to create an alfresco dining space after you have seen some of the beautiful landscape photographs. ---  --- The merchants that advertise in this magazine are fabulous.  I have purchased many items from them and have always been happy with my purchases. ---  --- I highly recommend this magazine to anyone that loves interior design, or just likes nice things.  This magazine is top notch all the way.
I own the HP 475 and since it's slightly larger then the rest, the printer barely fits in the case. It does fit but it is very tight. I would not recommend this for the 475. Probably I shouldn't have bought this but I really liked the case
I don't know how this skunk got 4 and 1/2 stars on Amazon let alone one!  I could hear Hepburn, Bogart and Holden rolling over with a resounding boom.  I think this is mainly because of Ford's Linus.  He is a very unsympathetic character in this remake.  The film critics said that, while the original Sabrina was about her transformation, this version was about Linus' transformation.  But here Linus shows no transformation that you can really see.  His explanation to Sabrina for his deceitful romancing at the end- "There was a merger, and you were in the way.  No hard feelings" is very cold compared with Bogart's "Would you believe I enjoyed every minute of it?"  In the original, you get the feeling that Sabrina gets the right man; you don't get that here at all
This is a great book to have on your shelf. Lots of good recommendations for a beginner quilter
I believe this will be very helpful for Christian People to understand who God is through the life
I love Cheetos! ---  --- Did you have any idea you could review Cheetos on Amazon.com?  I admit I had no idea.  I typed it as a goof and up the page came. --- But I stand by my 5 star review. ---  --- Full of yummy MSG.  Do you know how MSG works?  It dilates your taste buds so all the flavors seem more intense.  It actually has no taste of its own.  Did you know? ---  --- When my mother was pregnant with me, she would wake up in the middle of the night and ask my father to go out and buy cheetos.  I don't know why.  Maybe the salty goodness. ---  --- If cheetos cost as much as truffles, they would be a considered a delicacy and served at the finest restaurants.  I wonder if you can buy truffles on Amazon.com.  Shall we check?  See you there
I bought this for my daughter while I was still pregnant, thinking that it would be helpful thru the first few months (as well as later) in terms of being able to keep up with my daily chores and my 2 1/2 y.o. son. It certainly wasn't cheap, so I assumed that it would be a good product, and appeared to be safe and comfortable for younger infants. Don't let the product description fool you! Just as it says in some of the other reviews, it is very possible for your child to fall when in this sling, because of it's crappy strap tightener. My daughter was a small newborn, only weighing 8lbs at nearly 2 months, which was the first time I tried using the sling. And even being that small, for the 2 minutes I had the sling on I could already tell that the strap was starting to loosen. (Definitely NOT safe!) Aside from that, this item is so big and bulky that I literally could not even see my daughter in it. I might as well have just put a duffel bag over my shoulder and plopped her into it. There wouldn't have been much difference between the two. I WOULD STRONGLY ADVISE THAT YOU DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT! I want to get rid of mine, since it's brand new, but I threw away the box so I can't return it. And I absolutely cannot, in good concience, sell it to anyone else for their child. So, I have no choice but to just bite my tongue and throw the product in the trash. Don't make the same mistake I did!
I enjoy all three of the the Jurassic Park movies, though I think "The Lost World" is a bit weak.  While I think that anyone who enjoys action movies, monster movies, or horror movies should own all three, I find it difficult to recommend this set because there is a set that contains not only the three movies, but a fourth DVD containing substantial background information on the making of the movies.  I give this collection four stars only because the larger, more comprehensive collection is available and if you liked the first two, you will definitely like the third movie
I had seen this film a number of times either on T.V. or by me popping it in on my DVD player. Denzel Washington and Sarita Choudhury are a pleasure to watch in this engaging story about a love affair between a  Africa American male and an Indian woman, whom both has never been to there native land, and how their romance causes strife in a small Southern town.  The movie handles the reactions by both families to the interracial union of Mina and Demetrius. Against all this, a subplot in the story revolves around the loss of a homeland and friendship between Choudhury's proud Ugandan national father and the Black Ugandan friend he left behind during Idi Amin's reign of terror.  --- There are very few movies that can capture the emotions that go along with such a sensitive and controversial matter. Most importantly the opinions, thoughts, and traditions, both negative and positive, of both the Indian and Black communities are fairly communicated through the movie. A must see film and the only one I'm aware of that explores the relationship between African Americans and ethnic Indians.
The Last American Virgin was literally one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and that's saying a lot. It's not a surprise no one from this film went on to any sort of stardom. The writing was terrible, the acting was terrible, the direction was terrible, the pacing was terrible, the jokes were god-awful, etc. Even the girls weren't really that attractive (with the huge '80s hair and bad fashion)! I mean, what the hell was that fat, ugly, dorky girl with the glasses doing in this movie, and, even more perplexing, why was our "hero" trying to lay her?? And why was our "hero" best friends with that jerk who kept screwing him over with the girl he was in love with? They would be at each other's throats in one scene and then best friends in the next! I would say that the only redeeming quality of this movie was the soundtrack, but then they started repeating the same songs over and over again. I guess the producers ran out of money to fund the rights to extra songs. They played "Whip It" twice, "Shake It Up" at least three times, and, at last count, "Just Once" like five times, when "Once" was certainly enough. Songs that I didn't know at the beginning of the movie I  knew by heart word for word by the end. To top it all off, this movie had one of the worst, most disastrous endings I've ever seen. I can maybe understand if this was a heartfelt, coming-of-age drama, but when you're doing a mindless, teen-sex comedy, you don't end on a downer and depress the audience! After all the hell our "hero" goes through, he ends up driving home alone without the girl and still a virgin, and then, without any follow-up or warning, the credits start rolling! I was like, "What the hell?" --- The only great thing about the movie is that I had a ball paying "MST3K," only no one was around to appreciate my witty, sardonic remarks, so I'll have to reproduce them here for your pleasure: ---   --- On Arguing with Your "Best Friend" Over the "Love of Your Life": --- "Hey, I stalked her first!" ---   --- On Sparking Up a Romance with Said Girl: --- "Remember our awkward conversation in my pizza mobile? Didn't that mean anything to you??" ---   --- On Declaring Your Love for Said Girl: --- "I've loved you ever since I destroyed your bike just so you'd talk to me!" ---   --- On Major Operations, "Not that Big a Deal": --- Real line (referring to the girl's upcoming abortion): "Hey, it happens all the time. It's not that big a deal." --- My line: "Yeah, it's a simple coat hanger procedure!" --- (and later) --- Real line: "I know dozens of girls who've done it!" --- My line: "I've helped all the gals in the neighborhood. They call me Dr. Abortion!" ---   --- On Nerds at Parties: --- "Man, there's nothing cooler than sucking from a juice box with a straw! Aww, yeah!!" ---   --- On Fat Girls, Inconsistent Characterizations of: --- Real line: "You know I have to be home by a quarter to 12!" --- (a minute later) --- "You said you had drugs! Where are they?" --- My line: "I have to be home by midnight or my parents will kill me! So fu*k me in the a$$ and let's do some blow before they come home!" ---   --- On Choose Your Mate Carefully: --- (as our "heroes" scratch their balls after having sex with a promiscuous, older woman) "Nothing's funnier than getting gonorrhea, eh folks?!" ---  --- Skip this dreck and rent "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" instead. At least that one had Phoebe Cates
I bought this phone based on a review in Wired Magazine.  I love their reviews usually, but this one really let me down.  I read another customer's review (I forget where) saying they had sound quality problems, but I thought yeah right...one in a million.  Well I bought the phone and had the exact same experience.   ---  --- Very poor sound/voice quality.  It sounded worse than a cell phone in an underground wind tunnel.  I cannot imagine why. I charged the battery for 48 hrs, I had it on a separate circuit, and it had it's own line. I plugged in an old GE 2,4 ghz phone an whamo...no troubles what so ever. Needless to say,  I took the phone back and bought a cheap desk phone with a cord.  Sometimes you don't get what you pay for
This tie winder is not only twice the size I was expecting, but it doesn't work.  After one attempted use, the lid no longer stays on.  I would have returned it if the return shipping didn't cost more than the item
Poor and slow Focus and flash. Thought Nikon had a good name.......Wrong --- If you like this camera it must be you first digital
This is an all around awesome product. I have had great experiences with the program, and use it very often as we use it to create our entire high school's yearbook. Anyone one who says it doesn't have the basics is pretty much lying to you, it has anything you'll ever need and more. The people who review this product poorly do so because they don't know how to use everything in it.  ---  --- The only problem I've ever had is learing everything you can do with it, otherwise it is perfect
I gotta be honest, when I first listened to this album I was dissapointed. But like any truly amazing album, it just took some decoding, listening to the songs multiple times reaaaallly helps to appreciate what these guys are doing. Essentially, GaT are four people who are amazing at what they do, and we should feel lucky that they have found a way to mesh together perfectly. Their first album, emphasizer, blew me away, but I felt it lost steam around halfway through. This album does no such thing, and what is more impressive is that this is an all acoustic album, which means skerik is using the natural sound of his sax as opposed to the various effects that he is known for. This gives the album a much more natural feel and it shows that these four are able to make amazing music without any wizardry in the production department. But dont get me wrong, this cd SOUNDS amazing. Anyway, I saw them live last night in NYC, and they blew my mind... I recommend this CD to ANYONE, and see them live if you get the RARE opportunity!
I absolutely think you should have this book as part of your collection.  The pictures come to life along with the description.  The wording is simple and sweet.  I am a first grade teacher and taught using this book.  All my students enjoyed the memory this book brings to life.  Vivid pictures and colors are an absolute gift from the artist
My daughter has tipped this stool over 2 times!  I am returning it first thing in the morning.  I should have never let her on it a second time.  If she steps down on it on one side the whole thing tips over.  Please do not buy this product
This was a great addition to our Read with Me dvd collection.  My son loves it - there are so many games and options available that it keeps him occupied for hours! 
While you might like this bag as a shoulder bag, the adjustable straps do not work well as a backpack
I just wanted to comment on Sarah's comment which highlighted 3 intelligent men and her took seven hours to put it together.  My son wanted to time me and watch me put it together without help.  I agree if you treat the instructions with intelligence it will be complicated.  I took it in parts after reading it fully twice.  After all the small parts : pole, height adjustment apparatus, rim / backboard, i carried it all outside and put it togehter. One picture was complicated becuase of the small detail being overshadowed by the backboard.  Overall I got it done in parts, total time 2.5hrs with breaks in between.  Have fun and enjoy watching your kids smile brighten. 
My 4 year old son got some early christmas money from his grandparents. So we went and bought this toy at Target (and paid 30.09 for it) He loves it... his favorite part was that you can take the whole thing apart and put it together different each time. My only concern was that the snow monster needs camera batteries or cell phone batteries??? What are those??
Tellicherry Pepper at this price is remarkable.  The product is excellent, if a little difficult to pour from the large "mouth" into a small grinder.  Otherwise, great
I am very please with my purchase.  It is nicely constructed and a beautiful purple color
This basket is NOT stainless steel as advertised.  It is merely chrome plated.  I returned it immediately and have been dinged for return shipping costs and other miscellaneous fees as the 'error was not our fault'.  Amazon is continuing to advertise this item as something it is not despite being alerted to the discrepancy by other consumers.  I believe that qualifies this error as being entirely their fault.  This is not the level of customer service I have come to expect and rely upon in my dealings with Amazon
Typee is based on Melville's experiences when, as a young man of 22, he "jumped ship" from an American whaling vessel on the island of Nukuheva in the Marquesas Islands of the South Pacific.  It is written in a straightforward narrative manner, but it is a work of fiction, NOT a journalistic report, something that is often overlooked.  While, like "Moby Dick", it contains lots of factual details, mostly quite accurate as confirmed by subsequent research, it is a much more complex tale than it appears to be on the surface. ---  --- For a first novel, written when Melville was only 27 years old, the narrative power is quite impressive, as for example in his description of the escape from the ship over the mountains to the Valley of the Typee.  In the early chapters, themes of peace, beauty, and sensuality are combined with Melville's righteous indignation at the activities of Western military and religious intruders to create the illusion of an earthly paradise.  Gradually dread, loneliness, horror, and fear of annihilation come to the fore, as "Tommo", the protagonist, becomes convinced that he is being kept for eventual eating at a ritual cannibal feast.  He is finally rescued almost by chance, and because of conflict among the Typees. ---  --- I read the Oxford World's Classics paperback edition, which has an introduction by Ruth Blair, an Australian professor of English.  It was very helpful with Melville's historical and literary sources and the geographical and cultural context.  The chapter on "Typee" in "Studies in Classic American Literature" by D.H. Lawrence adds a further depth of understanding.  Newton Arvin's biography of Melville helps to place "Typee" in the development of Melville as a writer. ---  --- Highly recommended in its own right as a superb example of 19th century American romanticism, with hints of the impending metaphysical explosion of "Moby Dick"
I enjoy this cereal with vanilla rice milk.  It is good.  Especially when I eat it, which is what I do
I thought a fold-up tub was a great idea, but we've used this only maybe 10 times before my daughter turned 6 months, the maximum age of use.  I paid only $10, so not much loss.  She objected the first time we tried it, at about 2 weeks, and so we went back to sponge baths for a while.  I would suggest gradually introducing your baby to the tub.  Toys helped distract her when she was a little older.  My daughter seemed too big for it even at 3 months, though she was always 97%+ in height & weight.  To wash her backside, you of course have to take her out of the tub.  I usually forgot to plug it before filling it, and so usually had water all over the floor.  Instructions say tub is supposed to be supported by a sink; it certainly doesn't fit in our oval bath sink.  Maybe it would fit a 2-part kitchen sink.  The folding feature did make it easy to store on our closet shelf.  For a little tub bath, I liked it.  It was good for a quick bath or to really soak her, but in the end I prefered a unhurried sponge bath on a waterproof pad on the bed, which I think got my daughter cleaner
this movie was awfull.  supertroopers was awsome and beerfest was even better, so i suppose they can be forgiven for this cinematic abortion
I would not recommend this product unless you absolutely cannot afford to spend any more money. For around $60, you could get the "World Industries M.A.D. Balance Board" and get a much better looking and more durable product. Or you could spend around $80 and get a Bongo Board. If you really want the best and have the money for it, you could spend about $120 and get an Indo Board. ---  --- The Zoomboard that I received was green and blue. Unfortunately, it looks garish, but a child may like the look of this. In addition to the garish coloring scheme, the board has a rough sandy underside. This is good because it allows the board to better grip the rolling tube. However, after a couple weeks of using it (five days each week for 30 minute sessions with my 140 lbs. frame), the tube develops craters from the sand and wears down. Then again, if you wait it out, the sand eventually will slough off of the board itself and you won't have to worry about wearing down your rolling tube. But the gripping surface will be compromised. ---  ---  If you try using this on a hard floor and not carpeting, the rolling tube starts to move less fluidly than before. Make sure there are no grains, pebbles, or hard materials on the surface you are practicing on because they can easily ruin your rolling tube. This may be a failing of boards that use a wood rolling tube. ---  --- Overall, this board is fun, but not great quality. If you absolutely cannot afford $10 more to purchase a much better product, then buy this board and use it sparingly on a carpet to get a long life out of it.  If you can afford more, keep looking and check out the products that I mentioned above and get something that'll actually be worth your hard-earned money
Nutrex-Lipo diet pills make me sick to my stomach. I never lost any weight at all. They just made me sick. I would not recomend them to anyone. ISh
This product is great. It is a little hard to turn when both kids are in it.  But I found if you hold it on the outside of the cup holders instead of on the hand grips turning is easier.  Makes my life a lot easier with my 1 and 3 year old
Xenosaga II-Jenseits von Gut und Boese came in November to Europe and was the first Xenosaga, which was released here!!! But we European players never played Xenosaga I before, so Namco released the second Xenosaga in a great "Special Box". In this box was the game itself and a Movie-DVD with nearly all Xenosaga I movies.  --- Back to topic, in my opinion Xenosaga II is a pretty game with cool movies and a battle system that makes fun. --- The music in this game was composed from Yuki Kajiura in the movies and Shinji Hosoe in the rest of the game. I think Kajiuras music is really good but Shinji Hosoe did a bad job, with his elevator music ;o) --- The graphics are okay but I couldn't see anything outstanding. --- In the end I must say, that Xenosaga II is a good RPG, even if it's not so wonderful than the first Xenosaga. That's the reason, why I imported Xenosaga I from your country ^_~  --- But at last the most PAL-players are happy, that actually (my dictionary doesn't give me the right English translation for "ueberhaupt" ;_; sorry) Xenosaga II come to Europe yet!!!! --- So I look forward to the third and last Xenosaga and hope, that this Episode will be like the first!!!! --- Many greets from Germany.....Viele Gruee aus Deutschland ^
It is unfortunate that the only video presentation of Amahl is so generously flawed in stagecraft and sound production. It is not necessary to enumerate specifics here since some were cited in Ms. Lynch's review. True, Ms. Stratas' voice was often subjugated by the orchestra, but there were also  moments when her diction was less than perfect, during times which the orchestra had, gratefully, been relegated to a less prominent decibel level.  Here, sound production staff  must share blame.  Menotti knew what he was writing. A brilliant orchestrator, he etched clearly, the differences between orchestral dialogue and accompaniment figures. Staging, at times, appears to have little to do with the music. When one thinks of Menotti and opera (almost synonymous), the marriage of music AND theatre is considered a perfect union. Sadly, Menotti's obvious musical intentions were overlooked. It is heartening to read that a new video of this opera may be produced. I would disagree with Ms. Lynch that it is a good introduction to this operatic work. The beginning, the introduction makes the strongest impression.  It is lasting.  This is one indelibility I would not welcome
We have used Kona coffee pods for about a year.  They were excellent.  We found it more convenient to order through Amazon, as the shipment arrived more quickly.  With this last shipment, the coffee often was watery even though the coffee unit was functioning well.  It was hard to know what to do with these various boxes of coffee from from a remote supplier
This review may sound pretentious and ignorant, but in truth I'm a big fan of British history, so bear with me!   ---  --- Even as a film itself, it's surreal, and I don't like the acting.  But as with any historical film that includes the British, they're made out to be the absolute bad guys!  Sure we were forging an empire within France (i.e. The Hundred Years War), but rapists and murdering pillagers!?  Never! ---  --- Historically accurate, full of British sentiment, and down-right weird.  Avoid this film today, folks!
I've owned two of these now. The screen's great and I love the wireless headphones -- terrific for very small children. Our 2-year-old drove to New Mexico and back (well, we drove and he watched videos) with this thing.  ---  --- Unfortunately, both units broke after less than a year of use. The first one just stopped working (with a DVD permanently trapped inside). The second one just developed an intermittent white-out and screen noise that's happening once a minute now. So I am reluctantly abandoning this nice but very poorly made product and trying a different one.  ---  --- All of these little players seem to have reliability problems, so my main advice to everybody is BUY THE EXTENDED WARRANTY and make sure the warranty you buy will work swiftly and easily with no hassles -- you WILL be cashing it in
The brilliant theory of General Theory of Relativity authored by Great Mind Albert Eintein, is truely magnificient
DO NOT BUY!!! Great movie bad studio!! It has been announced that NEW LINE is replacing Peter Jackson as the director of The Hobbit. The only way to stop this injustice is to hit them were it hurts the wallet. Do not buy or see anything New Line till The Hobbit is returned to its rightful director!!!
When a movie producer in 1998 foregoes available spectrum of colors and technology opting to feed his audience grain-black, white and jittery gray, the result had better be good. That fraction of members of the technicolor-drunk general viewing audience who will even stipulate to watch such a thing do so at decided perils of time and money, push Play alongside Mr. Benefit-Of-A-Doubt and strain to see if it works. Thus begins the argument of effect and more specifically, that of color. The problem with a black and white movie is that very few movies that resort to that, despite some grand intention, DO NOT WORK, or, in the alternative, DO NOT WORK AS WELL. Citing two examples - SIN CITY which is near-tolerable acting paired with an absurd choice of black and white, tantamount to robbery, and GOOD NIGHT AMERICA which is all and about the same. The dilemma with black and white productions is that regardless of how well it comes together, there seems always a thread of an argument in the back of one's mind that if one must resort to black and white to make one's point, one might be better served as a charcoal artist. Color is the medium of life. From a budgetary perspective, black and white films save money as the 'challenges' of color, which, in a good feature, can be excessive, are thus eliminated. Yet complications arise - for instance - I wasn't sure if that was blood or motor oil dripping from that guy's hand. Similarly, the entire cast in SIN CITY could have been wearing hot pink, in shades of course, and we would never know. Yet of course this is no excuse to dislike a movie - or is it? One wonders, however, that, if PI production would have had more money, would they have opted for color? Moot point. It's done. ---  --- Notwithstanding the obvious that I don't prefer black and white movies and incidentally don't know lots of people who do, PI, although a courageous artistic attempt with significant merits ranging from creative camera work, clever symbolism and high-octane guts, seems to lanquish for other reasons. Despite PI's visceral intensity which is delibertaely hot-wired throughout, spinning out scenes that sizzle the nerves, after Max's third or fourth headache it gives up the ghost. As as result, the movie stays earthbound, weighted down by a mediocre revolving-door plotline (obsessing man chases number grail looking for key to life while beset by outside forces including the recycling feeds of his own troubled mind), unremarkable narrative with a gem here and there, failing repetitive effect and thin, uninspiring 2-D support cast, leaving the movie wanting for depth and intelligent character interplay. Unresolved imagery and scenes lent the impression that this creative endeavor was a bit out of control and ad-hoc which is no fatal flaw in and of itself but in this case was signficantly detractive. Despite a reasonably decent stockpile of cinematic victories the battle wasn't won. The themes inspiring PI have excellent potential however this movie trafficked the runway like an antiquated flying machine - airborne one second, belly down the next. As a fine creative exercise, the creators are praised for their effort and bravery - PI is as bodacious as a skunk engaging rush-hour traffic and commands the watcher's attention until that undefined moment when boredom sets in. Contains subterranean theme seedlings which likely served as brain fertilizer for the subsequent more advanced spin-off -  "A Beautiful Mind"
Date on still photo will not print,it's no good where yoy need that type of info on the printed photo
Purchased this as a gift for my grandchildren....This is Boring and absolutely NO FUN no matter what your age.  I guess for almost $40 you shouldn't expect flashing lights or something a little more exciting. Doesn't even deserve the one star I gave it. --- 
I took it straight out of the package, plugged it in for a charge.  Charger never reached "green" ready but the battery overheated and melted several hours later. ---  --- Customer Service was not the best I've had.  Don't make the same mistake, keep looking
...and if you're fortunate enough to find it, I recommend buying the version with the bonus DVD, which chronicles the making of Yellow Brick Road.  When I bought it, it cost the same as the 2 SACD set without the DVD, so it was still a great deal. ---  --- My only complaint--and it's really minor--is that it would have been nice if they could have fit the original album onto a single SACD.  A second disc could have included the bonus tracks that are included in this package, plus any extra--maybe even audio-only interviews--still remaining in the vaults.  No matter.  The important thing, if you are able, is to make sure you have an SACD-compatible player (like the Pioneer DV-563A, or one of the really expensive players if you've got the cash and love audiophile formats in both your hardware and your CDs).  Even if you don't, the stereo CD layer still sounds truly excellent
I got one of these loungers as a gift this past Christmas. As soon as I put it on the deck, everyone wanted to use THIS chair. So I got online and found another so we can share. It is more comfortable than any chair in our house
I can understand that Robin felt a need to include some of the biggest Bee Gees hits to appease the fans, but the ones that were sung by Barry are below wretched here.  Robin frequently disappears in the sound mix, becoming little more than one of a group singing harmony.  That's fine for a group concert, like the Bee Gees, but inexcusable for a solo effort.  His stiff between song talk sounds like a bad lounge act.  They should have kept this in the can.  It seems like it is meant as little more than a money grab for Robin. Don't do him the favor
Buddy Holly has a number of collections that are superior to the one put out under the 20th Century Masters series.  Every one of the CDs in this series is skimpy in content and superfluous.  This one is no exception.   Look elsewhere
I love the FIRM workouts, and I love the instructor Allie, so I was so excited to try this new workout.  I was unfortunately extremely disappointed. ---  --- This workout was not complicated, but it also wasn't much of a workout.  I didn't get my heart rate up at all, and didn't break a sweat.  Some of the moves are just not very good, and having to repeat them everytime we add on got really annoying. ---  --- The disco part was my favorite, but overall, this is a workout that I can honestly say I would rather have the money then the workout.  I will keep it and periodically do it on a VERY light day or in addition to another workout, but that's just because I have it.   ---  --- I've tried a couple other of the new FIRM workouts that are more worth the money...this one I am sad to say is not.
THIS SCREENSAVER IS TERRIBLE. IT PAUSES AND JERKS AROUND. VERY ANNOYING. I EMAILED THE COMPANY AND NEVER HEARD FROM THEM. I DONT USE IT AND I DONT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYBODY. THANK YO
I really enjoy organic foods, so when I came upon this item I was thrilled they were making organic popcorn- especially Newman's Own, a brand I've liked in the past.  I have to agree with the other poster, the flavor is bland and almost flavorless.  There are other brands of organic popcorn that I've found more recently that are far better.  Don't waste your money on so many of them!!
With a title like 'swirl skirt,' you'd expect the fabric to be able to, well, swirl.  But the fabric is stiff and not very comfortable.  Plus, the cut (of the size 12 at least) was awkward, giving my tummy a bubble that wasn't even there.   And the last thing I want is for my tummy to look bigger than it actually is.  So I don't recommed this item
we bought this as a cheap/easy stocking stuffer. It's simply not woth anything.  The little file is a good idea, but too tiny to actually work.  My daughter (8yrs old) liked the idea too, but was sad that she couldn't work with the tiny strip that's too short for even her little fingers. Cute, but not worth it
I bought this for my 4 kids who love the frozen drinks. But, I soon found that it does not work well. After a few uses the gears began to stick. It would no longer crush/shave ice. Stick with the smaller units
I was very, very pleased with the sailor outfit that included a very nicely made hat.  It fit perfectly and was ahit with Mom and Dad upon seeing him at the airport on their arrival home from being deployed for 6 months.  I found this same outfit about 25.00 more on other sites and so you can't do better on this buy
I was more or less forced to buy this product because I had very precise size requirements and this product fitted them.  I was very disappointed by the quality of the product for the cost.  It comes in about 19 different pieces, all of which are a hollow plastic polymer.  It is fairly lightweight, which could be good or bad depending on what you plan to do with it.  At the $200+ price, you'd think they would include a shelf, but they only give you a stencil to make it yourself out of 'shelving material'. ---  --- My biggest complaint was that I was missing four of the pieces and had other extra pieces when I received it.  I got bounced back and forth between Amazon and Suncast's customer service before I got the right people at Suncast to send me replacement parts (which took over a week to arrive).  On top of that, they didn't even send me the right replacement parts!  After another phone call and explanation, more parts were sent.  If I keep the extras I have, and make a couple more calls, I may have enought for a second shed.  Ugh. ---  --- Directions are ok, but they'll make you scratch your head as you look through all the similiar looking parts. Especially when they don't send you the right pieces
a tired bit of revisionist propaganda out of post-soviet russia which somehow won an oscar as best foreign film.  its fascinating that something so heavy handed can pretend to be an answer to the vile excesses of the stalin era, but what can one expect?  there is (at least one) great movie to be made about that era; dont look for it here.
This workout is nice because it doesn't mess around.  There are no long introductions you can't fast-forward through and the workout itself is challenging both the abdominal and breath series and the side series (which is all legs and hips) are really challenging and I plan on doing them to keep my muscles toned even after delivery.  One complaint is that apparently she releases the videos herself and they aren't available very widespread in retail stores.  I also would have liked it if they had included more arm work or a postnatal workout.  All in all though great
Although not perfect, I've used Roxio CD/DVD 6 Platinum and Nero 6, and returned to using this product. This should also be called "Burning CD's for Dummies", it is THAT easy to use. I've also used it to burn VCD's without a hitch. If all you want is a fast disk copier and compiler, this is for you
The views do not show the belt and buckle. I cannot tell from the photos if the buckle closes in the middle or is offset to the side. ---  --- Why does this matter? For me, it's vital information. When I'm backpacking I carry my glasses/camera/pen/notebook in a fanny pack. Of course the backpack waistband buckle is in the middle, over the navel. If the fanny pack buckle is also in the middle then the two buckles interfere with each other. ---  --- A few manufacturers are wise to this conflict. They make fanny packs with the buckle closure offset--between the left hip bone and the navel. The two waistband buckles do not interfere with each other. ---  --- I won't be considering this product because I cannot discern the photograph
I bought this ab roller after my chiropractor told me that I needed to strengthen my abs without straining my neck.  The "neck support" that it comes with does not support the neck or head in any way, but forces all of the weight of the head onto the uppermost vertebrae of the neck.  Ouch!  I would strongly recommend AGAINST this purchase.  Not only does it not work properly, but the foam pads were stained upon arrival.  Gross!  I will try another model
we bought 2 of these "things" they both literally fell apart within 2 weeks of receipt ---  --- the stitching, in various parts of the bag came undone, we ended up throwing them away. ---  --- i've been purchasing things on line since 1995, and this product was by far the WORST thing we've ever bought!!! ---  --- run away, run away
I am surprised to read that people don't like this mirror. We have had it since our son was 1 mon. and we still use it at 7 mon. We have a Trailblazer and it installed easily and we can see him great even over his Britax Marathon carseat. It has been great for road trips (our son was entertained even on a 9-hour trip) and has been a blessing for short trips to the store. We don't always use the music/lights but the mirror is always handy. We have never had trouble with it being too soft. I have given this as shower gifts and my friends have been pleased as well. Def. recommended.
It's been 10 days since I registered with Zone Alarm and I still haven't received the license key. I wrote many emails and called customer service and I got no help or solution. Think twice before purchasing this product
Ummm...I am a HUGE fan of Bratz, but this piece of junk is absolutely terrible. First of all, the eyes are super ugly. I can't believe they would make such an ugly product! The lips are fine. But I could reconsider by making better, cuter eyes! They broke when I had it after five minutes. THEY DO NOT BLINK. THEY TRY TO, BUT DON'T SUCCEED. DO NOT BUY!! ---  --- Second, the features are horrible. They are made so bad, I tried to make it walk since it couldn't on it's won! It does NOT walk. Note that. Also, it's head does not move. It was broken on mine and it made it fall down and the neck, while trying to move, muffled the song. Also, unless you wanna hear the same 20 second "Bratz Catz" song over and over again, do not buy this product. It will dissapoint your daughter like it did to me. I am the daughter, but am very dissapointed. I have returned mine and did not get a new one, either. I got some Bratz Babyz which were cuter than this junk! ---  --- I am warning you, this cat is brainwashed and should not be continued. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT UNLESS YOU WANT A CRYING DAUGHTER FOR IT!!! ---  --- Thank you for your patience and gratuity in reading this grievance. ---  --- Love, --- Brownie, baby doll lover. Get babies instead, they're cute! 
This machine bubbles but they are anything but quiet. the water was cold in less than 2 minutes even though i put hot water in has per the instructions. A bucket would probally have done better along with air pump from my fish tank
Only The Lonely is  a good romantic comedy type movie that has a great cast that includes, John Candy, Ally Sheedy, Maureen O'Hara, Anthony Quinn and Milo O'Shea. The movie is about a Irish American cop who lives in Boston with his over bearing overly opinionated mother and he falls in love with a woman who is mother doesn't like. This is a cute movie and I'm glad that they finally have put it on DVD
Look, notation software is notoriously expensive.  All musicians know that.  So, when you see SongWriter and its price, it's a relief.  Everything you need is in this program.  I only have one complaint. ---  --- When adding an expressive dynamic (p,mp,mf,f,ff,etc.) you have to add one to EACH note to insure proper playback.  That is a concern of mine since I use SongWriter to notate songs and export them in MIDI for recording purposes.  It leaves an ugly looking score. ---  --- Other than that, this is the best deal on the market for what it is
This is a good little product. Did not expect much, but in fact it helped me relax and fall asleep and stay asleep. - thank
Extremely disappointed, especially after having done a lot of research and read the great reviews that this product (and the Axion 7" player) received.   ---  --- I bought it for my wife for a road trip and she was excited about the large screen and the ability to connect an antenna to watch tv.  The player worked fine for the first DVD we tried, but after that the screen freaked out and went almost black.  You couldn't see a picture but you could hear the movie just fine.  No complaints about the sound I guess, but what good is that if the screen doesn't work? ---  --- Needless to say I returned this as fast as possible.  In fact, if I could rate it less than one star I would, since it didn't even last one day. Terrible product
I agree that Veranda has too many advertisements, but that's the trade-off for this very affordable, high quality publication.  I'm not sure I'm the intended target for this magazine because I can't afford most of the things in the ads, but I've gotten lots of ideas about color, layout and accessorizing that I can use, and the variety of architectural and design styles has helped me define my own style.  
This is a neat little movie about a 12-year-old boy (Anton Glanzelius) who tries to make sense of his mother's terminal illness, death in general, and a world full of change. He tries to cheer his mother up as best he can, but she is too far gone to really notice or care. His fondest memories are times spent at the beach with her when she was healthier and their times together were better. As a coming-of-age movie, sex plays an important (and confusing) part for the boy, from the old bedridden man in the upstairs apartment who likes him to read the lingerie ads to him, to the tomboy who is the best soccer player on his team and keeps trying to show him her breasts. The movie is full of wonderful, insightful touches. Glanzelius is marvelous. A real gem of a movie
Halo 1 on steroids, Halo 2 is a clear Microsoft stamp on Bungie's creativity and control and it muddies up what was a balanced gameplay.  A hackneyed single player story that makes no sense, and has no flow, along with levels that aren't replayable.  You thought the Library from Halo1 was tedious?  Try the headache inducing map design in this game.  Also in the nonsense, the unneccesary switch to an Elite's perspective for half the game, along with a new group of Covenant bad guys that look like rejects from a Captain Planet cartoon.  Apes with mohawks, yeah, nice design.  I can only play one or two levels of the single player, and they are so noobish, it loses appeal quickly.  ---  --- On to Multiplayer.  Okay, in 2004 upon release, this was a great game.  It took time to go up in level, and the ranking system wasn't as abused as it is now.  Once new maps, kept on the harddrive (read mod kids) were released by Bungie, that opened the door to full blown chaos.  Now 2 years later, modding has died down somewhat, but a whole new slew of bridging and connection speed manipulation makes it roughly 25% likely you'll find a game with no lag.  So I still play on occasion, it's lame they can't offer dedicated servers so you can play your map of choice, choose servers with good connections, and then the modders and big gun noobs can find the type of game they want to play too.  I only pray Halo 3's multiplayer improves on this system, otherwise I'm done with the Xbox console permanently
Bought 14 Fossil watches for Christmas gifts, all arrived in fine shape from Watch Zone. Of the group this was one of the nicest. Perhaps a little heavier than one would expect. Recommended
I'm definitely a satisfied customer.  My DHL package got to me damaged and the box was wet. The Bubble Tea customer service representatives where wonderful about replacing it.  I will buy from them again!  They have excellent customer service in my book! Thanks.   ---  --- Ange
When you get these cartridges right out of the box they work great, but after you start to print out a lot of pictures you really notice the quality deteriorate. It really seems to run out of one color much quicker  than the others. Personally its usually red. It has caught me with my pants  down a couple times, going to print out a project the night before its due,  only to run out of red or blue ink. I would definetly suggest to always  have an extra one around just in case
I ordered this as a gift subscription on May 10. --- By July 20, it still had not arrived. I contacted Customer Service, and was told it --- wouldn't arrive until September!  --- The description says it will take 6-10 weeks. It has now been 10 weeks,  --- and I've been informed it will be another 6 weeks
This magazine is just page after page of Hollywood P.R. agencies releases. Unbelievable. Why didn't I think of it? I know all magazines look for editorial content from outside sources, but other than a few pages of VERY subjective movie/music/book reviews, this magazine just re-writes and prints Hollywood press release after Hollywood press release again and again and again. This magazine must not have a staff of writers, but must employ an army of copy editors manning a warehouse of dedicated fax machines or e-mail inboxes. The funniest thing about this magazine is how the first few pages may be dedicated to a typically obsequious press release provided by, say, Tom Cruise's management company/major film studio/hired PR flak fawning over Cruise or his newest movie - and then you turn to the movie review section where some clever, sassy, wanna-be hipster movie reviewer proceeds to tell you that the movie absolutely sucks. Uh, okay - wait, didn't you get the press release? If you Tivo EXTRA and have the theme to Entertainment Tonight as your ringtone, this magazine is right up your alley. Otherwise, don't waste a penny on this nonsense.  --- 
I have this exact same soft light green deluxe pillow. I bought the pillow when she was about 2 weeks old. And I have been wearing it almost all day long every day since. She is 11 weeks old today. She is so comfortable when nursing on this pillow. The cushion is made of firm foam. She falls asleep on the pillow while it is around my waist. Even when she's not nursing or napping, the pillow helps me to support her weight when I'm sitting or standing. It fits me very comfortably even though I'm plus size. ---  --- The only drawback is that I need to order an additional slipcover because it can only be hung to dry, although it is machine washable. I really love this fabric, but apparently, this fabric is not available to purchase separately as a slipcover, so I guess I'll try the oatmeal twill cover.
This is the Optimus Prime that should have been made 20 years age. It was a difficult decision whether to open it or save it in the original packaging. Finally nostalgia won out and I had to transform him. It was amazing. The transformation took time but it was worth the wait. I felt like a kid again. I am totally satified with this product.
this thing is really cool and works very easily.  Once you perform --- the 10 minute setup and enter your info (once), you just step on --- it and tell it what setup number your are and it takes and saves the measurement.  It seems very steady and well built and I think it should last a long time
Junk.  You will get a lens cap error in about a year or so, where it will tell you lens cap is on and you will not be able to record anymore
We've had 3 of the LG1500 in our family plan for nearly a year.  Very inconsistent service.  When calling our son, I would get a message that his number was "blacklisted".  After calling Cingular several times, we demanded new phones...not LG1500.  We were told it was "like for like" exchange, but that policy is not in writing...so we're getting a different brand.  If a phone doesn't work, the company needs to get rid of them!
the bra cup itself is too big for my chest. and although interesting to look at because it looks like a bra women may have worn daily in the 30's and 40's it is not at all comfortable.  blah!  and i love vanity fair so its disappointing for sure
Overall, this is the best gaming magazine I have read.  It covers all consoles, gives sensible (and funny) reviews, and previews the hottest upcomming games.   ---  --- Most games are reviewed by two people, adding to the accuracy of the score.  It has a rating of 1-10, 10 being the best, a rating which precious few games recieve.   ---  --- The previews section gives you a sneek peek of upcomming games.  Some of them are one page long, some ten.  They all include pictures, and most have an estimated release date. ---  --- Also, there is a section on news in the game industry.  Ususlly near the beginning of the magazine, they include news on developers, consoles, and the big names in the industry.   ---  --- All in all, this is a great magazine, and well worth your money, because each issue is well over 100 pages
Kudos Microsoft. My last go around with Encare was with the 2004 version. At that time the program had a cluttered clusmey interface. The various modules weren't intuitive or intergrated and it was therefore, confusing and not partuiclarly user friendly. The new interface is quite simple but very powerful. It is well integrated with the web and therefore capable of constant updating. Perfect for the student and anyone who likes to research topics. If you have not tried Encarta in a while, check it out, there is much to like. 
The songs are boring, the lyrics are plain. I am so dissapointed. I bought it without listening to it first thinking I would at least find one song. How wrong was I to find out that not even one track speaks to me. Andrea's solo album sucked. Now this! I think their creative days are over and if I see them in concert again, I hope I am not tortured with the music from this new album. Instead I hope they play the oldies but goodies that characterize them as the band I love so muc
I have owned eleven VCOM products and from now on, they don't have my business. The product touts itself in part as a vital tool when/if your machine crashes. If it does, be prepared to shell out the cost for another complete program. You are told that the program is already installed on another machine and you can't run it-although this occurs after a lengthy and cumbersome installation process. Sadly, customer assistance is no help-emails are unanswered and you can't get through via phone...What you do get from them once you register are constant emails about new products. Thanks, folks. Version 6.0 is also much slower than Version 5. Support for 5.0, by the way stopped abruptly when the new edition came out, despite the functionality of that program.   For the price, the software should work like a major player, rather than a dollar bin special. 
I hope I get program to receive it next month ---  --- Patty Jone
This razor returns one to an Augustinian sense of progress and history.  It is similar to what my grandfather used to shave with, and is simply the best way to shave, so long as you have a decent brush and soap at hand
I bought this identical bed at Toys R Us for $175.00. This person is ripping people off, do your shopping before paying their mark up and shipping costs
I have been supporting QuickBooks as a financial and technical consultant for small businesses for over a dozen years.  This year's version added a neat feature that allows you to see all of your customer's invoices, payments, estimates, - all in the same window - just by clicking on a customer in the list.  No more multiple clicks to create customer reports.  It is just plain easy, and the information pops up on your screen immediately. Congratulations to Intuit on a job well done
The French title of this film is IN EXTREMIS (though translated as TO THE EXTREME) and means 'in desperate circumstances, especially at the point of death'.  Rethinking the story of this interesting but problematic movie in those terms after viewing  gives the cinematic effort more poignancy.  This is a tale of the impact of family, loss of parents, dissolution of the core unit has on us all: in this story we are asked to exam the 'in extremis' state of such trauma. ---  --- Thomas (Sbastien Roch) is a hedonist, a handsome young man whose parents died in an Alpine accident, and a man who sleeps with both sexes in a confused state of true identity.  He lives with one of his female lovers who has a young teenage son Grgoire (Jrmy Sanguinetti) whom he loves as a son.  When the mother accidentally dies, Grgoire wants Thomas to be his guardian.  Thomas' lifestyle does not lend itself to fatherhood and though he deeply loves Grgoire, by law and by proclivity he cannot assume the role of foster parent.  Even with the aid of his prostitute sister Anne (Julie Depardieu) he is unable to keep the disappointed Grgoire from being sent to a prison-like orphanage.  Thomas finds solace from his lover Vincent (Aurlien Wiik) and from his excursions into the bohemian all night orgies where he attempts to forget his promise to be available at all times for Grgoire.  Eventually Thomas' devotion to Grgoire overcomes his hedonistic addiction and results in his aiding the boy's escape from the orphanage to move with him to the home in Ibiza his deceased parents owned.  The story has a bizarre but touching ending, which comes totally unexpectedly, and revealing it would ruin the impact and message of the film. ---  --- Director/writer Etienne Faure ('Prisonnier', and ' la recherche de Tadzio' which is included on this CD and traces the life of the actor Bjrn Andresen who played Tadzio in the film 'Death in Venice') directs his actors well but is less successful in finding the interaction of flashbacks, fantasies, graphic indulgences and superimposed poetry inundated with noisy music.  But given these distractions the film still makes a simple case for the significance of family - genetic and extended - and therein is the power of the story.  This is obviously the work of a young director with copious ideas about film and as such one can forgive many of the early experimental indulgences because the heart is in the right place.  In French with English subtitles.  Grady Harp, May 05  --- 
The sensor works very well however, since it is an outdoor sensor, it should be waterproof. It is not. It must be placed where the rain will not fall on it
If you are looking to make a mess, lose milk and get frustrated, these are the bags for you.  First, these bags do no stand up on there own and it is very inconveniant to carry a little cup around to help fill the bag. You have to string the twist-tie into each bag by yourself.  Also you are supposed to tear the little tab on the bottom of the bag to get the milk out.  It's not that easy.  The first time I did it I lost a whole bunch of milk.  Your better off untwisting the tie and pouring it from there.  The worst thing about the bag is that they have leaked a few times that my caregiver was warming up the milk.  This never happened with the other bags on the market.  My favorite is lansinoh.  Another bag thing about these Medela bags are that they are more expensive than the others.  Pass on this and try others
My Mom wrecked badly on this the first time out, due to the difficult-to-control steering.  Very awkward handle bars...several of us tried to ride it.  My friend--a fitness pro & personal trainer--put it best by saying "That's the most uncomfortable bike I've ever ridden."  --- Mom ended up giving it to a charity bike drive.  I hope somebody likes it. :-
Abby Cooper has become my favorite amateur PI. The premise of this series, a young woman private detective who has strong psychic abilities which she uses to solve cases, is original and fun to read. Abby is a psychic, but she also has the same trials and tribulations of a normal young woman, money, sibling and romance issues. In this latest book, Abby, her sister Cat, and Abby's handyman Dave, buy and plan to renovate a house, only the house turns out to be haunted! Poor Dave, Abbey's partner and handyman, is attacked by his own chainsaw as he begins the renovation! Determined to find out what's going on, Abby begins investigating the history of the home and discovers a missing treasure with ties to WWII Nazi Germany. In order to solve the mystery, Abby depends on her spirit guides to help her on the case. There is danger for Abby and her friends from an unknown stalker and the romance between Abby and Dutch becomes more intense as they each must sacrifice some of their independence to become a real couple. Ms. Laurie has a great series going here, and I look forward to reading more Abby mysteries.
There is no comparing the incredibly honest reviews on Amazon with the high-brow reviews found in the LRB. One surveys average readers, and the other is the opinion of people who make a living writing about books. I, Brockeim, am more like the people than the professionals, and believes most of you are as well
I am in my early 30's and never had a problem with acne until my mid 20's.  I had been using proactiv for quite some time (5 years or so) and it worked pretty well.  I say pretty well since it did clear my face some, but my face has not been totally clear in a long time. ---  --- Along comes AcneFree which is "better" than Proactiv since you can buy it locally and it contains more of the active ingredient--cool, I am sick of ordering it online and it is cheaper! ---  --- Well, I guess you get what you pay for--I don't consider myself to have particularly sensitive skin, but I used AcneFree one time in the morning.  So far so good--until 2 am the next morning when I broke out in hives all over my entire body.  So no more AcneFree for me, just wanted to give my experience for anyone who might be in the same situation
Bought this about a year ago and now it has a lens cap error (appears like the shutter never opens) and will not record video.  Spoke with JVC and they seemed to know that this is a problem and are having me send it in.  Will update my rating after I see what is wrong, if they can fix it, if they will stand behind their product.  Watch for more details.  Before it failed only complaint I had was it was a little flakey with lighting but otherwise worked okay for the price
I have only read the Swedish translation of what I suppose is the "old edition", but judging by "Look inside this book", this new English-language edition incorporates much material from the old. Incidentally, the Swedish edition gives the authors name as Kallistos Ware, apparently his taken Orthodox name, while Timothy Ware is his original, given name.  ---  --- In Sweden, the Swedish translation of "The Orthodox Church" is the only readily available book on the history of the Orthodox Church. Apparently, its used informally as a textbook in some college classes on Church history. It also contains chapters on theology and worship. ---  --- In my opinion, the book is a necessary introduction for those interested in Orthodox Church history. Its first chapters summarize the history of this Church during the Byzantine Empire, under Islam, and in Russia both before and during Communism. Of particular interest is the authors interpretation of the Catholic-Orthodox split, usually dated to 1054. The author believes that the so-called Fourth Crusade in 1204 was the real and final consummation of this split.  ---  --- However, the book must also be read with some reservations. The author is, after all, an Orthodox Christian himself. Its safe to assume that there is a certain bias here and there. For instance, Ware denies that the Byzantine Church was caesaropapist, a very untenable suggestion. At other times, he is surprisingly "liberal" for an Orthodox. For instance, he paints Mehmet Fatih, the Muslim conqueror of Constantinople, as a very tolerant ruler. I also wonder about his interpretation of the Church father Cyprian.  ---  --- Even so, "The Orthodox Church" remains an indepensable book for those looking for a short and concise historical over-view of this remarkable Christian Church.  --- 
Installed great - looked good. Day 3 it started blocking me from websites 'as their security certificate had been revoked' - Amazon even? After a week of back and forth 'support' they couldn't fix it and left me with a partially working PC to drown.  THe PC support is partially automated as they didn't read my responses and their advice went in circles.  Plus trying to fully uninstall it is a nightmare. ---  --- It might work on XP but don't get it if you have Vista. 
The author shows she is obviously making a transition from poetry to prose with this novel.  Her sentences are long and wordy, and her numerous metaphors make little sense in their context.  She goes to great lengths to describe many little and unimportant details, causing the actual story to suffer from lack of content.  Her descriptions of life in general seem unreal - she describes things and events in a way that no person would do in the circumstance. ---  --- The storyline is decent in some places, but it is generally hard for the reader to follow.  Many times, I had to go back to read paragraphs and pages again to realize where the author was going.  It is true there were many points in which I wanted to stop reading all together, which is a rarity. ---  --- I was altogether disappointed in the book.  I thought it would be decent, from all the literary awards it had won, but it really was just pages of fluff and poetry disguised as prose
i have purchased other hats from well known companies. these hats are great for the money and are constructed well. good job!
I've had car chargers before, for other cell phones, and never experienced any problems. I was attracted to this one by the low cost, but I guess you get what you pay for. It lasted for about two uses and then quit altogether.
I can not stand this book. I can't even finish reading it. Kevin J Anderson can not write original Star Wars books at all. The only thing I have ever seen with his name on it that was entertaining was the Dark Lords of the Sith comic book. Everything he writes is unoriginal and lacking in story. He seems to have some obsession with Death Stars and world destroyers because all he seems to put in his books are those. Darksaber, Jedi Search, Dark Apprentice, Champions of the Force, heck even the IG-88 story he wrote for Tales of the Bounty Hunters had the Death Star tied in (IG-88 transfers himself into the Death Star...what the heck?) Seriously, this book is not worth it. Try Timothy Zahn or Michael Stackpole. At least they don't always use Death Stars. And while Zahn's last 3 books are based around Thrawn, the original Heir to the Empire, Dark Force Rising and The Last Command, when Thrawn first appeared, was not him dry humping the same concept over and over
Good purchase.  Although I have not used the headset yet, the case and charger work perfectly.  Great savings.  Amazon is the place to shop for a discount
I use the IR interface with the Polar s625x running computer, and I have never encountered a single problem. I usually use the interface in to different computers, a notebook at home (with XP), and a desktop at work (2000), and in both computers it works nicely. ---  --- You have to be careful and follow the directions that come with the IR interface. Install the software and drivers before you connect the device to the computer.  ---  --- I love my Polar watch, and the IR interface is an excellent complement for an excellent product. --- 
GOOD LOOKING KICKS IF YOUR KICKIN IT OLD SCHOOL LIKE ME. AND COMFORTABLE. AND RELATIVELY CHEAP. I'LL ALWAYS KEEP A PAIR OF STAN SMITH'S AROUND FOR WEEKENDS
My sister gave this to me at Christmas and I kept it out on the counter all winter in hopes of an early spring!!! I put all my feeders out the first of May and seen my first hummer the 2nd...hope they will find this one on my window...they are so neat to sit and watch. --- Make your own nectar to use in your feeder...I use a funnel works great to fill feeders
I wanted some earbuds for my Zen player which fit in my ears and wouldn't fall out. These earbuds did fit my ears. However, a month after starting to use them one channel went out and now I have sound coming out of only one earbud. Also, I have no idea why these are called, "high quality" earbuds, unless it was a sales tactic. The sound quality is not as good as the sound of the original Zen earbuds. I am back to using the original buds, but I'm $20 lighter in the pocketbook. I was dissatisfied with this purchase
I prefer the live versions of these pieces. Its nice to get more material from that period but you can hear the strain that was going on at the time of this final album by this line-up. I was at the concert for live record and think that they (the pieces that are on this CD) really come alive when being performed live
This movie is funny and by being so bold in so many ways is refreshing.  It presents realistic characters without worrying about offending people by presenting sterotypes.  It takes the time to develope the story effectively without boring the audience.  It is a long movie but it moves at a great and effective pace. ---  --- It is full of laughs.  Joe Pesci is one of the best comic actors of all time.  I don't think that anyone else could have pulled of the part of Vinny nearly as well.  Marisa was great as well and it was hard to find a performance that was less than great.  The writing and directing, two things that often get overlooked, was wonderful.  The only weakness?  The case is a little fantastic.  It is hard to believe the coincidences in the movie that lead to the boys being accused of the crime.  Of course movie plots don't have to make perfect sense but this stretches it.   ---  --- Though I usually don't like excessive foul language, this movie uses it in a funny way.  I guess it wouldn't work without it... --- but don't be mistaken....it has a lot of bad language.  Don't let kids under 17 watch it without supervision
I was kind of worried when I read some of the other reviews for this, but I'm so glad I ordered it!  It is sooooo much more beautiful in person than in the picture.  It's wonderfully sparkly and just the right size.  It did take a bit long to ship, but it was worth the wait
QuickBooks lives up to it's reputation of being the one-size-fits-all small business book keeping software.  It does what you want it to do.  I like the feature of being able to easily sent e-mail invoices.  If you need the software right away it is just as cheap at the office supply stores
These 10 minute workout combos are great for any busy mom since you can do one, two or three depending on how much time you have and how tired you are!
I had an Optoma H27 but felt it was lacking the brightness I liked on TV, and I heard that HD72 was much better.  So I returned my H27 to Costco and got the HD6800, which is Costco's version of the HD72.  Wow, "much better" hardly describes it!  The brightness is incredible, and the detail and colors are truly remarkable.  The other night, I was trying out different DVDs just to see what they looked like on the new system, and I was totally blown away. ---  --- While it does upscale DVD images to look better on its system, I also bought a Sony upscaling DVD player and there is a significant improvement with it with the HDMI connection.  I had read that since they are both upscaling, the DVD player's upscaling wouldn't be necessary, but I do find the image through the upscaling DVD the best in a side-by-side test using two Sony DVD players and two DVDs of the recently restored "Carousel" using component, s-video, and HDMI at the same time, all connected to the HD72.  I saw clearer detail on faces coming from the HDMI upscaling DVD player.   ---  --- I was so impressed, I felt like pulling in people from the street to see it, but I fought the impulse because I don't want to share it with anyone.   ---  --- With a little tweaking of the menus, new films like "Star Wars III" and "Sin City" showed incredible detail, and older films like "The Adventures of Robin Hood" were gorgeous in their Technicolor glory. ---  --- I highly recommend the HD72.
I bought two of these sets, along with the table and wow - i get so many compliments - they are beautiful on my new front porch.  I was skeptic at first because of the price, but they are worth every penny and a few hundred dollars more. 
I absolutely would recommend avoiding this item. It has a vile aftertaste - even if you can stomach artificial sweetener, this product's flavor is so blatantly unnatural. If you can get past the sweetener and the frightening list of ingredients, the texture isn't particularly appealing, what with the tiny granules floating throughout. I know this dessert sounds too good to be true, and it is
I do not like this item because it says it is a 16x DVD but when I put it in my burner it only reads it as 4x.  Something is wrong with the DVDs because my burner is one of the newest out there and it is a 16x burner.  So if you are looking for 16x, do not buy this one
I bought these steaks the other day and cooked them on Easter for my wife and I.  All I can say is, UMMMMMMMMMMM!  With a lite coating of koshers salt and pepper, drizzeled a little bit of EVOO ontop and layed them on the grill on a nice high flame.  They were cooked to perfection in about 10 minutes!  I just went back and orderd 12 more since they are on sale right now
I bought these for my dvd player.  They work wonderfully!  The old analog cables that came with the dvd player looked alright but [didn't measure up}.  These monster cables definately enhance the sound of my dvd movies, especially the dialogue.  The old cables that I had made my movies sound a bit muffled.  But the monster cables intensified the clarity from the dvd player to my reciever.  For those of us who cannot afford 5 speaker digital surround sound, I would definately recommend these cables if you use regular 2 channel stereo for your movies or CDs
I bought Taxcut this year because it was inexpensive and included business tax forms for my partnership. For the money I guess I'm satisfied with the partnership results, but that's where it ends. ---  --- Taxcut for Federal taxes is not integrated with Taxcut for business... ok so what do you want for cheap. But, it also isn't well integrated with the Massachusetts state tax version, leaving me to go figure how to deal with what it calls "special" situations (unreimbursed partner expenses and interest from out of state banks, for example). Overriding form data is painful and the program complains that if I override calculated data I can not e-file (not that I would trust it to e-file my taxes). Form navigation is hopeless. I can only imagine what someone who isn't experienced with tax preparation could accomplish with this mess. ---  --- I filed for an extension; now I'm probably going to buy Turbotax to do the actual federal and state returns. ---  --- With a deep discount, I would probably purchase Taxcut again for the partnership taxes, because it is slightly easier to use than the Excel spreadsheets I'd been using (but only because I don't have to copy the numbers from the spreadsheets into the forms). ---  --- Honestly, you would think there would be some tax software that is better than the non-functional Taxcut without the overblown, fatty and expensive too-many-talking-heads Turbotax alternative
After hours upon hours of trying to get this cable and software to work, It eventually allowed me about an hour of connected time, and then never worked again. My opinion is to stick with the OEM cable. The extra money's worth paying to avoid the headache
Bought to use in a cheesecake recipe that we've been enjoying for a year now using instant powder subsitutes...this is a reasonably-priced nice-sized sample to use. $5 shipping is a bit goofy for a soft 1-oz. packet of powder, but luckily I had a gift certificate. I look forward to trying different recipes with this. Cheesecake tastes good, a lot earthier/more organic now that we have the real matcha. I think I'll try making iced lattes now. Too bad it didn't come in the cute little round tin that they show it in...that was an appealing package but the resealable soft packet is nice too
Extra styli are probably useful for the vast majority of us who lose things.  This is one better as it has a pen built in.  Just unscrew the tip of the stylus and you've got a pen.  You never know when you'll need one, so when you do there it is.  It also blends in well with the design of my Treo 700wx both visually and tactile-ly.  Good stuff
This bar would be great if it wasn't so full of sugar. It gives me a sugar headache.
Ohhhhhhhhhh my my my, what can I say about this one?  By the time it entered home video on vhs in late 1987, I was not familiar with Freddy at all except for the fact that I knew the premise....he can kill in your dreams and goes after kids and teens.  The fact that I was at that time only goin on age 15 did not help.  I was terrified of anything related to horror.  In my mind Freddy was the worst.  As a scared 15 year old kid, Freddy was the last thing I wanted to view.  I was watching films like, Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Empire Strikes Back.  Those I could handle.  However, in late summer of 1987, a friend of mine rang me up and told me to come over because he had a new movie he had rented that he wanted me to watch.  I asked him what it was and he wouldnt tell me.  All he said was that id be surprised and that id really like it.  So, I went over and he wouldnt let me see the title on the box.  He just slid it into the slot of the VCR.  Folks, I saw the New Line Cinema Logo and then this graphic,  "Sleep, those little slices of death.  How I loathe them....Edgar Allan Poe"  My mind started to reel but I had not yet realized what this film was; and then I saw the title, "A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 3: DREAM WARRIORS."  Now mind you the closest I ever came to seeing this film was the wonderfully cool Dokken Video on MTV called, Dream Warriors.  I even had a hard time viewing the visage of Freddy in that MTV video.  Hilarious huh??  Anyway, when I saw the title come up, I grabbed my coat and I was getting the hell out of there and quickly.  However, my buddy begged me to give it a chance, he said its not as bad as I was thinkin and that id actually find certain parts of it actually funny.  Now I thought he was pullin my leg with that statement.  Even his mother told me id like it.  She had already seen it in the theatres and so had my buddy.  So, once I heard her reassure me as well, I decided to give it a chance.  As the opening of the film carried on I viewed the front cover on the box.  A vicious looking cover with Freddy's face leering over several teens facing him, appearing to stand on his out-stretched knives with a tagline that I find today to be one of the most creative taglines ever!!!  "If you think you'll get out alive, you must be dreaming."  Anyhow, suffice it to say, after experiencing dream warriors, I was instantly relieved and I was also an instant fan!!  I couldnt believe it actually because id sworn this character off.  I was terrified of him.  I suppose id have to thank my buddy Mike C. for that.  Thank you Mike for opening the door to this series for me.  Ive loved it ever since.  Ive seen all of them.  Many argue and argue over which film is the best, but Dream Warriors will always hold a special place in my heart because it was my first Nightmare and the first time I had to get ready for Freddy!!  :)  Hope you enjoyed my review.   By the way, I did laugh during my first viewing, and I also feel that poster art was the best of all of them
Man these things are the best. They can handle whatever issues I throw at them. I've done considerable load testing as I'm a truck driver who makes infrequent stops. Thanks for making my life easier. I'm totally back into life with Depends
Had 3 leaks all in the seams! Could not patch correctly even after waiting the "30 mins." to re-infalte like the directions stated. My son was extremely upset. From other reviews, it sounds like there is a 50/50 chance of getting a good product
This item was delivered in a timely manner and my son really enjoyed it. Thanks
I purchased this for my wife who wanted a case for her  --- HP Pavilion Notebook PC (DV5139US), screen size 15.4", ht 1.8", wdth 14.1", depth 10.4 ". The bag is for personal use, not business, and use will be moderate. She did want some extra compartments for organization.  ---  --- This case has met all her needs, it is light weight, constructed of durable material, well organized. Her notebook fits in this top loading case with ease. She is satisfied with this purchase. We would recommend purchasing this case. --- 
I thought I would be receiving bread, but I thought wrong. Rocks, I received rocks. And there is no softening them up either. Nor do they contain any ham. Just hard rocks
merchandise returned to vendor by shipper as damaged in shipment. Cancelled order!!
I loved "The RM" and expected the same level out of this movie, but my husband's whole family agreed to turn it off during the bathroom scene and never watched the rest.  The teenagers didn't even want to check it out after that scene.  They also loved "The RM".  If you can get it from the library go ahead, but don't spend money on it
 I have just started with an Apple ipod nano product and was not impressed with the factory included ear buds at all. They didn't sound real good and didn't come supplied with the ear bud pads in the box so they would just fall out of your ears. What's the deal with that? Next came the old Sony MDR 027 head phones from the closet. The Sony's have the old adjustable head bar so no more falling out of the ears now. They worked o.k., I guess, but in comparison these JBuds sound MUCH better than either of the previous ones. I'm now listening at half volume compared to about three quarters before and all sounds fine. I'm hearing parts of the music not audible before with the other two models. Crisper highs, great mid range, and responsive lows. Set up was fast too, just find the correct size ear bud pads out of the three different sized pairs supplied and your off and running. The JBuds actually stay in your ear. Wow what a concept. They are also very comfortable due to the fact I forgot they were in and started talking on the phone before noticing. The cord is just the right length for setting the ipod on a desk while still allowing plenty of movement or attaching it to a pocket. If you think you have a little too much just wrap some up with a bread tie. Better too much than not enough. So back to the closet with the Sony.  ---   ---  I guess what it all boils down to is you could do a whole lot worse than these especially for a mere twenty bucks. I couldn't have made a better choice for the money and quality. You should do the same.  ---  ---  Another quick note. The shipping went great. Not too long at all and with standard USPS. Thanks Amazon
My daughter and I have played all of the previous games; we've enjoyed them overall.  Some of the games are fantastic, challenging and fun. This game was quite lame in comparison to the others.  The puzzles weren't really puzzling, just boring tasks.  There were not many clues to find.  Because there weren't many clues, there was no real sense of detecting anything.  The game ended abruptly and was very short.  We did NOT use a walk-through to solve the mystery in record time, just experienced a lack of challenge.  We did like the newness of becoming Frank and Joe Hardy occasionally.  The rest was pretty boring.  If you are looking for a Nancy Drew game, try one of the others instead
I ordered this item with the hope of finding a new home for my ever-growing collection of credit cards, grocery store cards, insurance cards, club cards, hotel cards, airline cards... you get the point.  I was disappointed to discover that placing more than one card in the wallet prevents the "Accardion" from collapsing enough to zip close.  I can't imagine how such a defective design would ever have made it to market. ---  --- Unless you want a really large leather case for a single credit card, I would not recommend this product
The pic that I ordered showed a knee length half slip.  Instead I received 3 long half slips from Her Room.  I cannot use the long half slips and I sent them back. --- Also, I had bought them with a gift certificate from my granddaughter and couldn't find where to apply that, so the cost was put on my visa. --- Thanks. --- Jeanne Alle
The episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes. This one happens to be only 18 minutes. This mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle. Even though it only cost me $2 I still got jipped.  Let's hope Amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway. Be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them
These hair topia pills are nothing but garbage! Pure nonsense! Trust me, I know this because I used to buy them.  I first bought these pills last year in June 2005 after hair formula 37's unsuccessful promise of producing longer and stronger hair in the four months of usage. Well, these pills were not as expensive as the previous brand mentioned, and had promised also change dry and brittle hair into long and healthy, and it did absolute NOTHING. I said to myself, like hair formula 37, that maybe I just need to give this more time, so I bought a 2-month supply and gave it 3 months in all and there was no difference at all. This product might just work for others, which it has, but it certainly didn't work for me. I must admit that I brought this on myself, as my mother warned me not to buy these ridiculously expensive pill since they do nothing for hair that grows naturally anyway, and that if you really want to get hair pills then just buy them a whole lot cheaper in regular stores like Giant or even hair vitamins in the damn Dollar Store! Thus, I am here to warn others not to waste their precious money. And if you are going to, please don't do it on this site-you can buy this product a little cheaper at hairboutique.com.
I absolutely love this camera. I've told everyone I know to buy it. The picture quality is amazing. There are so many options with this tiny little camera! You can edit pictures before you even print them. Zoom in on a picture already taken and save it that way, and so much more. I take pictures of everything!  ---  --- I charged the battery when I got the camera, which was about three weeks ago, and it's still going. I have 7/8th of battery life left. I haven't had to charge it again.  ---  --- I am so happy with my purchase! I hope this helps you
I bought this item for my newborn - thinking it would grow with him and be useful for at least the 1st year.  I was SO wrong.  First, as I feared, the water "fishbowl" leaked the 1st time I filled it.  I returned it and the next one leaked as well.  Then, the mirror is one of those "plastic" mirrors that gives a distorted reflection - which was of no value or interest to my son. The cow that makes noise died after less than a month of light to no use.  Finally, the toy just didn't have that "fun" value that a $43 toy should have.  He hated it - never attempted to crawl down it, never played with the features. Save your money - this toy is of poor quality and poor entertainment value. There are tons of better products out there..
 "The Dreaming was one of those albums that I found in my parents CD collection when I was young and I haven't outgrown it yet. My parents seemed to hate it and never bought a Kate Bush CD after it (though I recently bought her whole collection except "The Whole Story" as it's just a greatest hits!). This album took me a very long time to get into however. I listened to it several times as a child and then put it away because I thought it was too strange. I took it out then several years later and loved it. I would now say it could be my all time favourite CD and is better than "Hounds Of Love" as I see it. The songs all stand on their own and Bush's voice is brilliant and her quirky themes shine through. This is the only album that I will never skip a track because I'm always in the mood for them all. ---  ---  1. "Sat In Your Lap"- A great opening track. Bush deals with whether she can be bothered to do something or not. The instruments are great as always. ---  2. "There Goes A Tenner"- A notable song for the quirky British accent Bush puts on. The instruments are very good and remind me of the '80's (as it was made then!). That was a good decade for music! ---  3. "Pull Out The Pin"- The piano arrangement is excellent in this song and the chorus is so good. The lyrics are about someone who is in war and thinking about pulling out the pin of a grenade. The song was inspired by a documentary. ---  4. "Suspended In Gaffa"- I don't actually know what Gaffa is but this song is still so great and catchy. The lyrics are quirky and the instrumentation is excellent. ---  5. "Leave It Open"- An excellent song that reminds me more of "Hounds Of Love". The instrumentation is excellent as always. ---  6. "The Dreaming"- Another brilliant song which is so funny because of Bush's Australian accent. The production is good and so is the songwriting. ---  7. "Night Of The Swallow"- The use of Irish traditional music is a nice effect to this song. The singing by Bush is superb and the song is flawless! ---  8. "All The Love"- The song has a sadder feel to it but is excellent. The lyrics are unusual and very well done. The instruments complement Bush's superb voice and never overtake! ---  9. "Houdini"- The album cover is to do with this song. The song is excellent with a really quirky chorus and good instrumentation. ---  10. "Get Out Of My House"- A perfect way to end an amazing album. The lyrics are so good and it is so funny at the end when she turns into a mule (within the song obviously). It is something only Kate Bush could have written! ---  ---  Overall I think it is an amazing album though I can see why people don't like it. It could be a little too experimental for some though for me it is perfect. Kate Bush shows she was the original alternative female and the best (yes, she's better than Tori Amos). She is one of the few geniuses of music and an all time amazing artist. Reccomended to everyone into alternative, especially Tori Amos fans! ---  ---  MARK- 10/1
The tale starts out with a historical reference to Chaucer.  For a fraction you wonder if you are watching the film you expected. And then you see the Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger eagle that transitions us form mid-evil times to present day (1944) England. ---  --- Time is taken to give depth and background to all the main characters by the use of interactive dialog. We find that each brings different technical skills and interpretations of the road to Canterbury: ---  --- U.S. Army Sergt. Bob Johnson (U.S. Sergeant John Sweet) on his way to Canterbury mistakenly gets off in the hamlet of Kent. He is accused of having his stripes on upside down. ---  --- British Sgt. Peter Gibbs (Dennis Price) is temporarily stationed at Kent while staging for overseas. He was and theater organ player before the war. ---  --- Alison Smith (Sheila Sim) a London store clerk before the war is now seeking a job as a `Land Girl'. She seems to have an uncanny knowledge of Kent and the Pilgrims' road to Canterbury. ---  --- The night they got off the train at Kent they had a strange encounter with the mysterious "Glue Man".  Then befriended by the local magistrate, Thomas Colpeper, JP (Thomas Colpeper, JP). Mr. Colpeper is interested in the history of the Pilgrims' Road from Kent to Canterbury. ---  --- Until you get pretty much through this story you are never really sure where they are trying to take you.  Is the focus on a local mystery? The interaction of the players or the lives of the characters themselves? ---  --- -------------------------------------------------------------------- --- Be sure to get the Criterion version with the second DVD. The main item besides the film is the voice over commentary by film historian Ian Christie which will rival the film for entertainment and after watching you may want to give the film that other star.
great flats! Compact and small for those who have too many shoes already. The only thing with these shoes are the elastic part starts hurting the back of my my foot, but only happens if you wear them for a long period of time.
Old Spice is a great-smelling cologne and I've worn it for years. My dad wore it when I was growing up and I remember he almost always smelled of it. It's a great cologne for lean, athletic guys who love retro; it's been around for decades and is a classic for masculine men. It takes a certain type of guy to pull off wearing the stuff. The smell really draws attention to a guy so he better keep his body hard and fit if he wants that type of attention, otherwise he'll just be annoying. Old Spice Cologne actually smells better if you let it age in the bottle for a long time; exposing it to heat helps to age it (leave a bottle in the car or attic in the summertime or outside in your tool building). Trust me, it smells awesome if you let it age. I meant to rate this a five star but hit the wrong toggle. I'm proud to say I'm carrying on the tradition of wearing Old Spice cologne. It's  not nerdy and it's not just for older men. It's a cologne for any masculine guy. It smells great
Whenever people hear of Sofia Coppola they think of 2 things: her much-maligned performance in Godfather III, and her famous dad Francis Ford Coppola, director of the Godfather films and Apocalpyse Now. The latter is particular fodder for nepotism remarks, although it's not as if her dad has made some stellar movies lately. "Jack" anyone? Well this film and her next film Lost in Translation should tip the scale on her favor as she's quite perfect for this kind of material. ---  --- The 5 Lisbon Sisters live extremely sheltered lives thanks to their over-protective parents, in particular their mother. After one of them commits suicide, a boy starts liking one of them prompting to bring some friends to meet the rest. An infatuation develops and pretty soon they start getting into something that when it's over, they still don't know how to make sense of it. ---  --- One of the things that can sometimes happen with a film like this is that in order to explain the story, certain characters moments have to be dropped or just never filmed. While I'm certainly not faulting the film, we're never really invested enough into each girl and who they are. In fact I couldn't actually name them until someone in the film actually did. It's not that big of a knock but it's one thing I noticed. ---  --- Performance-wise it's pretty solid across the board, including Kirsten Dunst and another against-type role for James Woods. Usually very manic, he's quite sedate here which is quite perfect for the dad. There's also the almost unrecognizable Kathleen Turner as the very strict mother and even a quick scene with Danny DeVito and Giovanni Ribisi as the narrator.  ---  --- The DVD definately needs a special edition even though what else could there be to add besides a making-of, deleted scenes and a commentary? Than again Lost in Translation seemed kinda sparse. A commentary on this disc from anyone would've been great, even Francis would've done a great one a kind of critique/overview on his daughter's first film. I mean this guy did do Godfather, surely he could've given a professional's review of this? ---  --- It's hard to say which film's better but this film is quite a good one regardless and proof that one really bad performance doesn't make everything else terrible
Terrible user interface - you must page through tons of cryptic menus to set basic features.  Pulls multiple papers through, so you must start again.  Is a G3, which you would think would be compatible with earlier non-G3 fax machines - WRONG - so you can't fax to 75% of the community that has a non G3 unit!  I thought I was buying quality from Canon when I paid $250 for this hunk of junk!  The cheap Brother and HP's at my work never have these problems and are easier to use, and much less expensive.  Save your money and save the headaches!  Sorry Canon, this product was a disaster
My dad got this for me to supplement a Latin textbook I have been studying for my high school language course. It is quick and easily understandable. You get plenty of words and phrases, which is perfect for a traveler. If you want to learn the language for the sake of knowing it, not travel, however, you'd better get a book to supplement this. It doesn't teach about pluralization, verb conjugation, or other oddities that the language holds, such as, in Latin, the ending -m which implies a direct object. The Latin CD also does not use the dashes over the vowels, which may or may not be necessary, I don't know. Overall, I am very happy with the product and with the price of $39.99 (USD), but I am also quite glad I have my textbook (ECCE ROMANI) to go with it
I love this flash.  I just recently purchased it and have used it for 2 big events and it worked perfectly.  I still don't know everything that it is capable of doing but am still able to work it just fine without even reading the manual. --- I would definitely recommend this flash.
I got this accessory with my Door Gym and I like it.  But, when they say this is an "efficient" accessory - they mean it.  It simply rests on the narrower neutral grip posts of the Door Gym.  The Door Gym has multiple grip areas, but two of them are perpendicular to the rest of the bar for narrow neutral grip chin ups.  The Broad reach bar is wide with downward grips (like lat pull down bar in a gym).   ---  --- Anyway, this works fine if you have the faith to try it the first time and prove to yourself it won't roll off because your body weight has it pinned on the posts. It has foam covering that adheres to the foam on the Door Gym posts. It will not roll easily, but it does a little. I think it is safe for adults who understand how to use it.  Do not give it to kids younger than about 15 (in my estimation) because some of them are too likely to play with, or misuse, it and get hurt. ---  --- Even though this thing works and does what you want a broad bar to let you do, I deducted a point in the rating because I don't think  they were up front in explaining exactly what it is and is not
Hello, ---  --- I have not received this item. Please send me the delivery receipt details
After Tuesday, no more lettuce. Never again. ---  --- I can still see that lady's eyes..
Item as expected, services average; shipping cost wasn't as ecconomical as I would have liked to have seen but, obviously, I paid it.  I probably could have found the tea in a store but am hard pressed to get anywhere, so...  All-in-all, everything went as expected
Just received this set today, and I'm already on my second cup. --- I can't wait to show our dinner guests this set so they can feel like they are dining in a 5 star restaurant

I ordered a subscription for my step-son and a gift for a niece at the same time.  They took my money and both of the ONE-YEAR subscriptions I paid for only resulted in ONE ISSUE to each child.  I couldn't get any more information on the magazine, as we never received any more informaiton until I got an e-mail from Amazon asking me to renew. ---  --- I noticed another recent post with the same problem.  The magazine was really great, and my step-son and niece both waited and waited for their next issue which never showed. ---  --- How disappointing.  I wouldn't take the chance if I were you. ---  --- LD
This was never meant to win an Academy award. It's simply a fun, classic country filled ho-down film with the intent to showcase some of the better country artists of the sixties. The acting is below average, and I wouldn't want it any other way. That's the charm with these two "Hillbilly" films starring Ferlin Husky. It's nostalgia at it's best, and you can bet the farm-fence that I'll be watching this many times again. Forget the Mamie,and Jayne talk; they were a bonus to this classic clunker. They were never meant to steal the show. Pick up "Hillbillys in a Haunted House" too. That one will do a number on you that you're not likely to forget anytime soon
I can't believe that this is considered a "Gourmet Food". In the UK long life UHT milk is an excellent standby when you run out of fresh milk, and it tastes much better than this Parmalat. OK, brands differ and taste is a matter of preference and there are mixed opinions as to whether the UK UHT milk tastes as good as pasturised, but many are just as happy with it as fresh. There is no way that the Parmalat could be mistaken for fresh milk. ---  --- And how expensive. Just add Gourmet to the title and up the price! In the UK it is similar or cheaper than fresh milk. ---  --- I can't understand why it is not more available in the USA.
It is bad! As much  as I like "10 new songs", this one disappointed me a lot.
I first saw this movie on TV as a college student. I loved it so much that an old boyfriend went out and bought it for me on VHS tape. I have watched this movie so many times I'm surprised the VHS tape is still working! ---  --- The actors are perfectly cast in the leads. They are so believeable in their portrayals that I could have gone to high school with them. The kissing scene is HOT. Clothes don't need to come off for you to feel the hot wind of chemistry and passion that blows off that first kiss scene. ---  --- The characters are not glossy, and that is what I love about John Hughes. He portrays coming-of-age in all its naked and truest glory, not the perfect airbrushed schlock that has come out in later years. ---  --- If you're looking to see character development and great plot set to a great soundtrack, this is your type of movie
I made the mistake of ordering this camera to substitute buying a pro camera. The color and noise was terrible. If you want a great point and shoot camera get the Canon powershot s50 while they are still available. The camera has pro features, it was so good they stopped making it because it should have been in the pro camera line at a much higher price tag. If you want to see s50 pictures go to [...] and search my gallery Cathreen Styles. All most all of the pictures in the gallery were taken with the s50. I am going to buy another just to have when mine breaks. By the way, I did end up buy a pro camera, mainly because of the look. I got the Canon 30d and love it
Every Lakers fan I've ever met lives in the past sadly now.  To them, the clock stopped when Kareem and Magic hung up the shoes [and we know why Magic had to leave].  Their basketball knowledge from the 60s to the 90s is rewarding.  After this, however, they don't have a clue of what has happened to this once mighty and moral organization. --- The Lakers have been a good team over the decades [as apparent on this DVD set], but the run of greatness is coming to a LONG slide with Kobe driving the Bus.  The Lakers were once considered the Green Bay Packers of the NFL, but now they're just lucky to even get close to a playoff spot over a majority of the teams in the Western Conference which are much better than the present Lakers. --- I recently attended a game last Fall at the Staples Center, and besides all of the celebs eating hummus in the stands, I could barely hear myself think over Phil Jackson's mantra "I told you so." --- Further illustrating how things have changed in LA, Jack Nicholson has become embarrassed to wear anything purple or yellow. --- So it is understandable that Laker fans would rather focus on the achievements of Magic and Kareem, than rather extol the diminishing skills of Kobe since his Colorado folly.   --- There are some good games on this DVD along with great moments from the Baylor, Chamberlain, West days.  I recommend any Laker fan to purchase this DVD set to relive the past. --- So Laker fans, keep living in the past if you so desire.  Maybe Kobe will retire and become a man of the cloth and lead the Lakers to the NBA Championship promised land once again. --- Long live the Forum [or the Staple Remover Center] or whatever they are calling the Lakers home now
Just remember to use the proper cable, Cat 5e or Cat 6
We've had the same set with Christmas colors for three years.  After the first year, the "whistle" unit (housed in the tender) no longer worked.  And about 10 minutes into running the second year, the engine stopped.  Found that the engine was wired so that the power wire was rubbing a drive wheel.   ---  --- The engine is built with an underpowered motor, such that a fairly high power setting is required to get it moving and then it runs fast; there is only a tiny operating range before it will fly off on a curve.  The engine is very top heavy and the curves have a tight radius to them.  Finally, when taking the entire engine apart this year found the plastic gears flimsy, badly supported and worn even with recommended oiling.   ---  --- I still have some of my fathers Lionel trains and these can still be counted on to run today; the new stuff being sold is meant to be in the trash quickly. 
Cross pens are a real favorite and I have one pen with a cat on it that I call my "lucky" pen because I've been writing with it for years and I seem to write better with a cross pen filled with a medium blue refill. The price you pay for the pleasure of smooth writing is that now and then the ink will ball up on the pen tip and you have to "roll" it off onto some paper. I normally find some ink on my hands after using the new refills and the problem may be that I'm writing for so long and the pen has become warm. Even with this issue, the writing seems perfect and the ink is a soft sapphire, easy on the eyes and the pen writes like a dream. I'm writing out all my recipes with these refills and they look wonderful. Writing with a Cross pen always feels a little more luxurious and then pen has lasted for years.  ---  --- ~The Rebecca Review 
Please don't waste your hard earned money on this awful toy. It is tiny! The "hinges" and lock had worn marks on the plastic even before opening the product so you know they will break off soon. The "jewels" never sink, either. ---  --- Interestingly, PoolToy doesn't list the size of this product. In fact they don't give much information at all which is very misleading and disappointing. What a rip off. I hope Amazon discontinues its association with this company. Look at the feedback record for them. It's as terrible as this toy is
I subscribed to this magazine at the same time as the Conte Nast --- Traveler, and I'm going to keep this subscription and let the other one expire.  This magazine has articles about places not about (as one other reviewer wrote) articles about martinis, fashion etc. --- It also has a lot less advertisements and when there are ads they are relevant more to travelers.  It probably all boils down to what kind of travel you prefer to do and read about but for me this magazine is my preferred one
I wanted something to use while mowing the lawn without emptying my bank account.  Cuts the lawnmower noise to a tolerable level, and the sound quality is decent.  Headphones are comfortable and adjust easily.  Unit collapses down to a more manageable size for transportation.  Good battery life
It's hard to do better than a Weber and this grill has not disappointed in the two years I have owned it.  I use it 3-4 times a week and have cooked just about everything you can imagine on it.  I am very satisfied with its performance, but it has a few minor flaws.  I still have my Genesis series propane grill that is still fine after 12 years, but it was not big enough so I moved up. ---  --- Pros: --- Stainless doesn't rust. --- Large enough to cook a substantial amount using indirect method.  Last night, I simultaneously grilled 4 T-Bones, 10 skewers of tequila-lime shrimp, sweet peppers, and bread.  That's why I wanted this grill.  I need room to cook. --- Insulated box holds the heat well. --- First side burner I've had that actually works. --- Assembly was relatively easy. --- Strong rotisserie motor.  Spin a turkey or 3 chickens; no problem. --- The smoker box w/ its own burner is a great feature. --- Stainless grates are better than any others I have used in past. --- Lots of shelf space w/ fold-down shelves. --- Battery-fired push button starters for all burners is easy and reliable in all weather conditions. ---  --- Cons: --- Expensive.  But I do expect a long service life. --- Gas guzzler.  More than one tank is helpful. --- Couldn't find a cover that fits it.  But it is stainless... --- Gas gauge doesn't work that well, but no biggie. --- The bottom of the cookbox has warped a little resulting in the grates being loose and shifting more than I'd like.  On occasion when cleaning the grates, they will fall into the bottom of the cookbox.  I can work around this and probably fix it without too much trouble, but it does tick me off.  This cost them my 5th star; I expected better. ---  --- So I pretty much love this grill and it's a good thing, because I believe I'll have it for a good long while. ---  --- Chad, the weird chain on the door is for manually lighting the grill.  It is a match holder on a chain attached to the door so you won't lose it.  Go figure
When DVDs came out I thought that CDs were gone.  I thought all bands would start making videos out of all their songs and selling DVDs instead of CDs.  That's what happened with records.  CDs came out and no one released vinyl anymore.  I am so glad that The Sun was the first band to do this.  Every song on this disk is golden.  There ain't a bad song in the bunch.  I heard about this disk on NPR radio.  It seems that it was taking Warner Bros. so long to release the CD that the band made homemade videos for all their songs.  The record company heard about this, watched the videos and said, that's cool, here is some more money, go and make the videos professionally and we will release it as a DVD, like it was a new idea or something.  I talked with my buddies and most of them also thought this should have been done a long time ago.  Another thing that is way cool is the audio tracks.  All the songs are on the disk in .wav form too so that you can put it in your computer and tell Windows Media Player or whatever you use to put it on a regular CD and play it in your car or convert them into MP3s.  There is even a sticker on the shrink wrap encouraging you to convert the .wav files. --- I could go on and on about how much I love this disk.  I played it for my wife, kids, coworkers and they all loved it.  Like other reviewers said, The Sun is a new classic.  Keep it up boys.
This is among the most disappointing Symantec products!!!  When one tries to log in to the infovault, the login box is often empty! There is no way to submit the information.  It is also impossible to get a straight answer from Customer Service. BRING BACK THE OLD PRODUCT, PLEASE!!!!  Have been a Norton customer for years....this one is just not great!!
THE COLORS OF BANDANNAS I ORDERED WERE NOT THE COLORS I RECEIVED.  THE INVOICE SENT WITH THE BANDANNAS DID NOT CONFIRM  THE COLORS I ORDERED SO I DID NOT HAVE PROFF THAT SEVERAL ERRORS WERE MADE, BUT I KNOW WHAT I ORDERED.  I WAS CONCERNED AFTER PLACING THE ORDER BECAUSE THE COLORS WERE NOT STATED ON THE CHECKOUT PAGE, BUT SINCE I HAD ORDERED THEM BEFORE, I THOUGHT THERE WOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM
I'm tired of waiting for this item- I MAY like it, if it ever ships
Great product has a nice spin.  (_)(_)=====D ---  ---                                      
I bought it on Amazon a few days ago (I saw the movie a long time ago but just now bought it) and got it today. The movie is awesome. Nick Nolte and Martin Short make an awesome team. The story is probably the best part of the entire movie. It's about an ex-con named Lucas (Nick Nolte) who just gets out of jail and immediately gets involved in a bank robbery commited by Ned (Martin Short). There are so many funny scenes on here. Here are the funniest ones: --- 1. They think Ned (Martin Short) is giving birth (he stuck a teddy bear up his shirt to make it look like he was pregneant) --- 2. When Doctor Horvath (Kenneth McMillan) gives his story about Lucas (Nick Nolte) (tells about the "hunting accident") --- And there are a few more. There is even a bit of Drama in the movie, most of it involving Ned's daughter, Meg (Sarah Rowland Doroff). This movie is perfect. I recommend it to everyone. If you haven't seen it yet, you must see it now. Because if you don't, you're missing out
 --- I really love this system and find it has met all my needs.  My son receives only breastmilk and this system has made it SO easy to express, store, and feed him with a bottle. ---  --- I have not found the liner cost to be a problem.  Nor was I disturbed by how many kits I needed to buy.  I think I bought 5 or 6 to make sure I had enough.  It just depends on how much you're going to need to store.  But you don't need many actual bottles, since the milk doesn't have to be stored in them, so the price evened out for me.  Besides, it's much cheaper than buying formula! ---  --- I also don't care about exact measurements of how much my son eats.  I can get the measurement just by lifting the liner out and taking a look.  But when he's at the breast, I don't know how much he's eaten, so I don't track just how much he has from the bottle, either.  I just make sure he has enough dirty diapers. ---  --- I find the system easy to use because I can express directly into a liner, put the bottle into the freezer, then remove the liner from the bottle when it's frozen.  This reduces the space needed.  When it's feeding time, just pop one of them into a bottle, heat, and replace the cap with a nipple.  Easy!   ---  ---  ---  --- 
I bought a pair of Powerballs. I used one yesterday. It performed just as advertised. My drill and the Powerball did all the work for me. Wiping the residue off was no problem. It's a great time saver. I highly recommend the Poweball to anyone who's a fanatic about their wheels
I cant understand how anyone can give this album more than one star.  Luckily I got this cd for free when they were handing them out to everyone who came to their shows on their 2005 tour.  I love classic Journey, but this band has gone downhill faster than I ever thought possible.  Most of the songs are terrible-boring music and even worse lyrics.  'Arrival' was pretty mediocre, but this is about 5 steps DOWN from there.  Granted, Steve Augeri does complete justice to the old songs in concert and really sounds great, but he obviously has nothing to offer in the way of songwriting.  The only way this band will ever create quality new music is if Perry were to stop sitting around at home and come back to the band.  Otherwise, the band should seriously consider not making any more new music and just go on tour every couple of years
 This was o.k. Nothing more nothing less. This album was hard to review, beacuse no songs really stick out. I mean the guy is a mediocre artist with mediocre rhymes, laced over just above mediocre beats. I have heard better Sesame Street singalongs for yappy kids in the back seat of a mini van.  ---  I mean what does the album have that sticks out? "Saturday To Saturday"? "Bloody Horseshoe"? Or the multi- faceted "Boo, We Ain't Forgot About You" None of the above, or none on the album. ---  --- Sorry. And please, all angry people who think that this is a bad review, remember, it's a REVIEW. I can say what I want
               I am the Star Wars Fanatic ---  --- I really like this toy! It has firing misiles and stickers to put on the vehicle. And, you can open the wings! This is a great toy! --- 
I had been using a spring scale for years and it was fine until I went to a friend's house and saw what I was missing. I put that scale on my wish list that day. This is a lightweight , fairly compact  scale with "on/off" "tare" and "grams/ozs." buttons. it has a clear, plastic,removable bowl for measuring and says it can weigh up to about 3lbs. and down to 1/4 oz. I like it for its slim design its ease of use and for its easy clean up
This was a very interesting movie.  A friend told me to watch this movie after I told him that I really liked the movie The Skeleton Key.  I think I liked The Skeleton Key better... but this was still a really good movie.  There are a few scenes with nudity in it.  Not a movie for the youngsters. We had to stop the movie a couple times to talk about it and at the end my husband was the only one who guessed how it was going to end.  A good movie if you want a movie that keeps you guessing
I'm always skeptical of "age defying" products, but this one really works.  I've been using it since it first came out (maybe 10 years?) and people often think I'm younger than I am (27).  I'm not really using it for that though - I use it because it is unreal how good it is with acne.  It prevents breakouts and also heals current pimples SO fast.  When I run out, the breakouts are back
The editorial review states its big enough for two heads to rest on it.  It would be more informative if you stated the dimensions of the pillow!
I've had two Skagen Watches and have to say they are my favorite. I love the large face and the Titanium bracelet (you don't have to remove the watch in order to shower!). A lot of people have complimented me on the watch, too. Given the price and quality, you can't go wrong. If you ever need a part replaced, you just send it to Skagen; the work is completed in a couple of weeks! In summary: an elegant watch at a reasonable price
Great flooring system. Easy to assemble and very strong. --- Expensive but worth it
Functions the same as more expensive chargers sold in Cellphone stores.  Excellent product for the price.  I bought two...one for home and one for work
This tent is not designed for the rain, instead of running off it collects on the top.  If left unattended, it pools up until the poles bend and the entire this collapes unrepairable
I purchased this for my 8 year old for Christmas and thought I would be able to store more than just a few songs, but the memory capacity is actually only 109M and will actually only hold about 8-10 songs, no where near the 2 hours promised.  I would not recommend this purhcase to any child
The Tiffany's version is super expensive. These are clean and simple. They get the job done
This product is good. I haven't seen any issues with this so far...
I had two new fully operational G5 computers with Panther operating system already factory installed.  I was contacted by Apple that a new Operating system was available, faster, yada yada yada. --- I took the two computers into the store and purchased the new operating system Tiger. --- The software proceeded to completely destroy both hard drives on both computers. --- I returned them and told them I wanted my mony back. They refused since the software was oipened but agreed to replace the corrupted software and install it for free. --- The computers never worked right since. --- We were forced to continue working with these crippled computers as we have deadlines to meet.  It was a nightmare --- as it took four times the normal time to do the work because of crashes etc.  We were already out a week with down time due to their negligence. --- When the smoke cleared we took them back in and asked them to take the operating system Tiger out and replace the computers with the original operating system.  Another four hours standing in line. --- We got them back to the office and low and behold they still did not work. We took them back again and were told by a snotty tech that we had dust in the computer as if that's what the cause has been all along. He told us never to come in with dust in the computer again even though the dust was in areas that we are not allowed into without breaking the warranty. --- If this were the case why hasn't it been a problem for the past 12 years? and what am I supposed to do? only use the computer in an operating room?  The dust he displayed was extremely minimal the computer was only six months old and if it were such a problem why didn't the other four techs working on the computers notice it and clean it the first four times they had it on their bench?   --- Bottom line.. I'm tired of buying new programs and computers that don't work. Tired of standing in line for hours. Tired of companies not having a complaint line. How handy is that? No wonder they keep saying your the first one that's had a problem with this.  That's literally impossible since I work in the entertainment indusrty that deals with editing and service bureaus that operate 100s of computers.  They all are avoiding Tiger because of known problems as well.  Apple is not addressing this and hundreds if not thousands of businesses are losing valuble production time due to their negligence. Instead of trying to develope a way for my daughter to dock her I-pod to a bowling ball, they should concentrate on making operating systems work in their computers. --- Total time lost in our company is at least a week which is in dollars around 20,000.00. I can't imagine how much is being lost nation wide. Something needs to be done about this.  They need to be held accountable for the destruction they cause by distributing faulty product.To add salt to the wound they keep coming up with all these stupid ideas on why the computers are not running right after they destroyed them initially. There comes a time that if they can't fix them, they need to replace them and stop wasting the consumers time and costing them money.  We need a lemon law that applies to computers.  Then the manufacturers will make sure they function before they are sold. I know I can't get the money my business had lost back but I want them held accoutable for distribution of a faulty op and replace the computers they can't fix instead of sending me back to the office with inoperable computers
Very well-thought design. I just wished I looked up at the pictures on here again before I pushed my 8525 in without sliding out the keyboard first. I thought it was weird. But after I looked at the pictures again.. man.. how brilliant! They should've provided some sort of User Guide on how to put the case on. And the leather is of a very high quality too. The seller is awesome, very Amazon-like shipping (i.e. fast)
The main character came across as gay to me too. This movie is in no way realistic. The other reviewer is right about everything. It's a really cheap movie made by amateurs using plastic toy guns, the actors jerk the guns to make them look like they have a kick. The "martial arts" in the movie are weak and sloppy, there's no way that crap would actually work in real life. I don't even know why I bothered to watch the whole thing, I guess I just found the stupidity amusing. The cover makes it look like it would be a cool movie, unfortunately that's the only thing they put much effort into. I rented it from Block Buster too, they need to burn it. This movie looks like some kind of a high school project or something, like they had to make a movie to pass drama class
This watch/heart rate monitor is everything I wanted. I can get a heart rate in about 5 seconds by putting your index and middle finger on the two buttons on the top and bottom of the clock face, I havent used the other features yet, but appreciate not wearing a strap HRM anymore
Best face cream ever, but even though Cosmetic Mall .com had it for less, the three week shipping, and Poor service from USPS from China, I'll pay the extra buck and get it from Nordstom again next time
The series just keeps on getting better. ---  --- The Bob Newhart show was one of the best comedies ever on television.   The other funny show was "Newhart", which I cannot understand why it has not been released on DVD. ---  --- The whole cast just clicks.  I wish shows like this were still on television. ---  --- If you enjoy a good laugh then buy this and the other sets! ---  ---  ---  --- 
The music of Dowland is wonderful - but Sting isn't up to interpreting it. You can't even distinguish the words half the time, just a jumble of nice sounds from his pretty tenor - he doesn't possess the skills to carry it off. This music has to be interpreted by someone with an ability to express thoughts in heightened language...Sting, for all his merits, hasn't got that in his repertoire yet.  ---  --- It's an exercise in pretention, laughable at times. The letter reading is ridiculous. I love both Sting's voice and Dowland's song, but this CD is a failure.
The Good: --- When I first heard about this board I was incredibly excited.  I have been playing BF2 (Battlefield 2) for almost a year now and still continually find myself stumbling over the keys. So it was a godsend to be able to purchase something like this directly intended to help me be better at my game.  ---  --- The interchangable keysets for different games and applications is quite intriguing -- the first that I have seen.  But the price for each is kind of high but well worth it. ---  --- The Bad: --- The board is constructed well but don't expect this to replace your home keyboard.  The "Windows Keyset" that comes standard with this board has all the keys as any run-of-the-mill keyboard but it is awkward to type with (I might be biased since I have a MSoft ergonomic split keyboard).  ---  --- In-game typing is difficult at best (with the gaming keysets). With most of the gaming keysets the keys on the left 1/2 of the keyboard are laid out like your home keyboard but on the right 1/2 side they are all vertical (not staggered.. like U,J and M  keys are 90 degrees vertically on top of each other). The keys feel a little "cheap" .. When you push them down they don't bounce back as much. ---  --- The Ugly: --- About 2 weeks after I purchases this board (and the BF2 keyset) 9 keys went completely dead.  I tried to reinstall the software, reboot and even resinstalled a fresh copy of Windows XP to no avail. ---  --- I contacted support and it has taken us 3 weeks to finally reach the decision that I have a faulty base unit. DUH!  They are "reviewing my warranty" but most likely it will not be covered because it has been longer than 30 day. Maybe this post is premature but I don't think I am getting a new base unit. ---  --- Conclusion: --- The expression "Great Idea, Bad Execution" holds true here. My opinion: Don't buy this board. Ideazon has too many issues, not enough support staff and a website that doesn't do anything but look good
Interesting.  I never knew there were so many varities of garlic and onions.  I'll be growing some next year
I bought this camcorder 3 months ago and, after using it a grand total of 6 times, it is broken.  It constantly loses track of timestamp on the tape doing things like rewinding 2 minutes (two minutes on the counter in the display), refusing to rewind anymore and telling me the tape is full.  It's a 60 minute tape and it can only record 2 minutes???  I figured that was a problem with the tape so I tried another one, which seemed to work fine until I got home and tried to watch the footage.  The camera counter once again became confused and the whole camera just locked up.  I had to power off and on several times before finally getting the camera to rewind the tape to where I needed it to be.  Lastly, the mechanism for ejecting the tape broke after only one month.      ---  --- One last note, the support for Panasonic is horrible too.  You can't talk to a "real" person and instead have to go through an annoying robotic voice recognization "person".  I'll never buy another Panasonic product again...give me Sony
I purchased these for my fiance to wear for our beach wedding in Puerto Rico.  The quality is horrendous, the cut is for MC Hammer not real men, and the company charged me over $22.00 to ship them to me and then told me I wanted them Fed EX.  Not true, the pants were returned, the rest of my order cancelled and I will never purchase anything from this company again
I absolutely love these shoes.  I have a very high arch and I am a hard heel-striker.  Needless to say that finding a comfortable shoe for my difficult feet has been a real chore.  These shoes have plenty of cushion in the heel and yet also support my arches.  However, I did put an extra arch support insert in (did I mention I have really high arches?) but didn't get the usual "crowding" effect which was wonderful. I've bought lots of shoes that were supposed to be right for my type of foot but after running in them had to eventually give them away.  These shoes were honestly perfect right out of the box, I've been walking/jogging/running in these babies for over a month now with no problems whatsoever. I plan on buying several pairs of these before somebody decides to "improve" them and changes something.  Boy do I hate it when I finally find a shoe I like and then the company decides to 'improve it' and screw up a really great shoe (bitter much? gee not me)   --- I also received the shoes in less than a week and that is a miracle where I live.  Good service all around.  Hope this helps someone else.
Anyone following a gluten-free diet knows how expensive it can be to buy the gluten-free version of anything - and when trying a product for the first time you hope it actually tastes good.  This is one gluten-free product I am completely delighted with - both in taste and price.  These corn flakes are crunchy and delicious (I like them better than the glutenated alternatives), and work well for other recipes.  Candies, cereal crumb pie crusts, fried chicken, etc. 
This CD is not at all what it appears to be. They got other people singing and playing the music, so it's not what you're probably looking for. Terrible misrespresentation. I was so disappointed! Thank goodness I used my other party cd's or my guests would have left......and I would have held the door open.....not blamed them for leaving!
people plz  ive had my ps2 a month after it came out ok i have had 2 controllers the ones i bought that day i play at least 8 or 9 hours during summer 4 to 5 hours a day during school year i have never had any problems at all my cousins have thrown these across the room at the wall when they get mad nothing happens these are very durable 
I could barely get through the...um...er...reimagination...of the childern's classic - while the set design and special FX are state of the art, as usual for a Tim Burton film, the actual movie is hard to watch. Why? Depp's "performance" is chock full of ticks and mannerisms, off-putting, flat, self-absorbed, and finally, one-note. Rather than the quirky fun of the original 1972 Gene Wilder version, Burton's film is more horror than fantasy, often casually cruel and sadistic to the point of being far from family fare.  While deliberate on Burton's part, that doesn't make the final product any more watchable. It's one grim, dismal, downward spiral slog. Not much holidday fun, huh? As with most of Burton's other big, expensive failures, he knows how to CREATE a convincing world, but has no clue how to POPULATE it with characters and situations we identify with and/or could care less about.  The final result is a film that's like a fragile, hermetically sealed curio on the shelf - nice to look at from afar, but hard to get attached to, much less involved with. What a waste of millions of studio $$$
This movie is very mildly amusing for about ten minutes.  Yes, it is slightly interesting to see the Cannes environment, but not enough to watch this film. It could be a cure for insomnia, though.  Fans who are looking forward to seeing their favorite actors in a satire will be disappointed.  You can count in seconds the amount of time any famous actor is on the screen, and it's really just very boring. All those fans of Johnny Depp: be particularly warned. He may have co-star billing, but blink and you'll miss him
This is a must-have item if you want to add the Clock Tower to your set.  It also works well with the other "elevation" sets, particularly Mile High Mountain. ---  --- The set includes the following: ---  --- 4 ramps (these are made from two shorter pieces that are screwed together) --- 2 curves --- 2 short straights --- 2 guard rails --- 2 end ramps --- 8 arches (2 supports and 1 crosspiece each) ---  --- The crosspieces of the arches have a picture of how the ends of the track should be aligned.  The screws are a little tough but never need to be removed.  The set is enough to run up two full levels and back down again (my son has played with this set just by itself having fun running up, around and racing back down).  You can also make two single-level bridges, a single level bridge and a ramp down from Mile High Mountain, or many other setups. ---  --- This set literally adds a new dimension to a Geotrax set.  Lots of fun.  The short pieces also allow for different configurations that may have been frustrating in the past.  Definitely fun.
THE CEREAL IS DELICIOUS.  I PUT HALF OF A BANANA IN IT.  IT IS FULLING FOR ME. IT IS LOW IN CARBS AND NO SUGAR.  I AM PRE-DIABETIC.  MY SUGAR COUNT IS VERY GOOD WITH THIS.  I WILL NEED THEM AGAIN SOON
Ernest Hemingway dies on page 161 of this 300-page book and so does author Valerie Hemingway's story. For that reason this book merits only two stars. Early in her story of meeting Hemingway in Spain in 1959 at age 19, Valerie is aware of the author's magnetic and dominant personality, "Around him everything came to life....There was an urgency and vitality that...did not ebb." ---  --- When she stays focused on the story of Ernest Hemingway, this is an endearing look at the older, struggling Hemingway finding temporary renewal in the freshness of an innocent Irish girl who entered his life during the final drafts of "A Moveable Feast." ---  --- But the youthful time spent with the famous writer works against this memoir since she was clearly neither as dedicated a correspondent or note taker as her subject. As a result, her recollections are thin and easily available in other sources such as A. E. Hotchner's "Papa Hemingway." The two years she spent living and traveling with Hemingway through Spain, Paris, Key West, Cuba, and America, share as much space as her weird marriage with Hemingway's strange son, Gregory (apparently the other "bull" referred to in the title).  ---  --- It shows the continuing vitality of Ernest Hemingway - even in death and over 40 years later - that a Valerie Hemingway can find a book deal for her meager remembrances of such a great man
The socks were nice but cost too much .  Price a little unreasonable
FANTASTIC sound for the money!  (seems to work well with Asus P5W DH, anyway)  Nice crisp highs, decent mid-range and unmuddied lows make this an excellent pick, IMO.  The only down-side I could find is some of the nonsense-software included is, well, nonsense.   --- Creative scores, again
I excitedly upgraded to Office 2007....'07 Outlook is FAR slower - ties my reasonably powerful machine up in knots (110% of resources) for minutes at a time inexplicably; spell ck doesn't work consistently; HTML emails have lost functionality I used to use often with 2003 ver; Excel opens MUCH more slowly; no real gains in Excel fuctionality; various add-ins essential to my biz no longer work in Excel 2007; Access 2007 was billed as much easier to use - FALSE; Word has a couple of improvements but messes up spell ck with Outlook if you keep both Word 2003 & 2007 on yr machine; the highly touted "Ribbon" is mainly cosmetic; I believe 2007's indexing is at the heart of some of sluggisness which might be ok if it worked..but it retruns strange results....NET, NET, I am uninstalling Office 2007 and going back to 2003 with all its stupid faults....it's too bad no one at MSFT actually uses thier products to realize how defective they are. 
I can't remember when I felt so good about an online purchase.  The product is more than I expected for the money and the quick service just awed me!  I will definately be doing business through AMAZON many, many more times in the future!  THANK YOU
I was lured to this product by a rebate which made it free. The manufacturer Computer Associates burned me for the rebate and will likely do it to you too. As for how it works no trouble installing like others have mentioned but it slows my computer to a crawl. After a while you will shut it down and then you can resume surfing the net at normal speed
There is so much to see and discover in this game. It took me over 70 hours just to complete the walkthrough and I am still working on capturing all the monsters for the Monster Arena. Someone who wanted to complete all side quests, find all special items, etc. could easily spend more than 100 hours on this game and never get bored -just incredibly deep gameplay. The graphics are also outstanding, among the best I have seen in a video game. It took me awhile to get used to the Sphere Grid used to increase your characters' stats. At first I didn't find it as satisfying as the typical method of "leveling up". But eventually I began to enjoy it and it's now one of my favorite aspects of the game. The only thing I found tiresome was how long the cutscenes were. The storyline itself was quite good. But I wish it was told with shorter cutscenes or at least gave players the option to skip through the cutscenes. Still this is a minor complaint to an otherwise excellent game. Definitely worth buying!
Excellent movie that shows how families should be and how most African American families really are. Big Mama's are always the most important component to a family. Definitely a collector's item.
I heard that this grill was "only" 36000 btu, and was not as hot as some other grills.  Believe me, this puppy is plenty hot if all you are going to do is cook food!  Disregard this btu rating.  This btu rating is rubbish.  This grill will transfer so much heat to your food so fast that if you're not used to cooking with a high-quality grill you will turn your beautiful porterhouses into charchol (I used a custom-cut 3-inch porter house to break in my new grill, and to my surprise, it was closer to well done than I prefer, but still DELICIOUS!)  Everything is high-quality.  It is much more solid than all the other grills I looked at, and the grill is very even in terms of heating.  Besides, it is beautiful.  The side burner was not something I was really interested in, but I just went for it.  I used it the first time.  THIS is the grill you need
  We went through three of these before we finally gave up.  Our poor baby was crying and we didn't know cause it stopped working in the middle of the night.  I luckily am a light sleeper.  Also the static is bad especially if you have a cell phone any where near.  We bought a cheaper,  safety first brand and have not had any problems
I bought this for my husband. We tried it in one car and it kept getting stuck in the lighter socket and the end kept coming off (it wasn't screwed very tightly and couldn't be screwed tighter). In the other car it fit in the socket all right but every couple of minutes you had to adjust the radio station and even then the music came through fuzzy. Also, if you turned the car off it doesn't remember which station it was tuned to. We are going to return it to Amazon, but I'm not sure how as I don't think they have an option for returning it as 'the product just isn't very good!' If you want something cheap and are ok with it not being particularly reliable then this is for you, but for hardcore music lovers, I suggest savinf up and investing in a better product.
This is the worst holiday movie in America! I mean if you buy this product you'll face torture (as in singing horribly.) Making friends as the movie says is not the most important thing in the world in my belief. They also said that "If you want, wish for fairy tales and it will come true." Right. Some fairy tales are gruesome (for example this one fairy tale is so gruesome because it has fairies heads cut off.) Eeww! The voice talents are very annoying. Better save your money when you buy a christmas movie
To start off i am a huge grateful dead fan and i have prabably about 150 cd's that cover many years of there carrer.  This release is very good and worth buying.  it has some great music on it and the price of the album is worth the eyes of the world with Branford Marsalis on the sax alone.  All and all this was among my first bunch of grateful dead cd's that i got and it got me hooked so do yourself a favor if you are thinking about listening to the grateful dead and you want to hear something from the 1990 era buy this cd.  But i would also get something from the 77 era too
The battery works very well.  However, the silver door that comes with the extended battery falls off easily
Bridal Guide is a lengthy magazine designed to appeal to brides in waiting and to those women who see marriage on the horizon. This magazine is devoted to bridal fashion and to other things that are involved in making the day special and memorable. Besides the fashion, one can read about wedding planning, honeymoon ideas, photography, and other wedding- related things.  ---  --- When you read a copy of Bridal Guide, what stands out more than anything are the photos. This is the main reason people read this magazine in the first place: To look at wedding attire and compare different styles. Models wearing wedding gowns are abundant in this publication and some of the bridal gowns they adorn are quite stunning. To help future brides make a possible purchase, it is common to find a phone number and/or a web site with the majority of the photos. Bridal attire is the main focus of this magazine, but there are also some pictures of grooms and of other wedding party members, with models displaying other fashions for sale, once again complete with phone number and web page.  ---  --- The part of this magazine that focuses its attention on honeymoons and travel is probably my favorite part of the issue. What I like is the fact that this is one part of the magazine that can appeal/apply to anyone, regardless of marital status. These honeymoon tips and destination information provide some good reading material for the bride to be or anyone else who happens to read the magazine.  ---  --- Bridal Guide is a very lengthy publication, with each issue containing around 500 pages! This is more than double the length of most other magazines and it can make the issue seem a little overwhelming at times. Also, this magazine is saturated with ads. Since the majority of the gown- clad models are, in effect, advertisements for a specific fashion brand, one can expect to find ads covering the vast majority of this magazine's pages. This could be annoying to some, but one must bear in mind that the magazine's focus is wedding planning, so excessive advertising is expected.  ---  --- For young brides- to- be or bridal wannabes, this is a handy magazine to have around. It's very long, but it contains lots of fashion and wedding planning ideas to make the big day one to remember forever. 
if you are a fan of Oscar Peterson this belongs in your collection
The protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications (GPS car holder), but does do what is was designed to do. Solid grip, and non-slip. Would be nice if it was not so thick
I bought this camera like 7 months ago since it was so small and i liked the design....but the pictures it takes suck, specially in the night time or with flash, you can barely see what you are photographing. --- THe video feature its ok even though you cant change the zoom while making the video, but the design doesnt suit well this feature since the audio-in is in the exact same place where you are suppossed to hold the camera...so most of my videos dont have audio since i was blocking the audio entrace... --- Its small and portable, and i could fit it in any pocket, so thats good, but its so small that the battery lasts only aorund 90 min...that's what it says, but it keep going down like 5times faster than a regular min, so it only does last like 30 min
I love these nuts, I stock up on them whenever I can find them in the grocery store, now that Amazon is carrying them I can stock up whenever I go on a nut hunt.  They are sweet and crunchy and so stasifying that I can not go back to the other brand.  Actually I bought the "big" brand of nuts just recently and gave them away after trying a mouthful.  These nuts have spoiled me for any other.  These are GREAT!!
This magazine should be free, since there are so many advertisements.  Also, it is strictly modern decorating, unlike the editor's claims.  If you like extreme, modern style, try it out; otherwise invest in something else
I believe these must be the tastiest sardines on the planet.  They are small and tender, not like the big fish sold by some other brands, and the olive and pimiento are the perfect seasonings for sardines.  Great with crackers and oranges for lunch
The Mityvac appears to be a sturdy, well-built piece of equipment. I've used it twice and it is foolproof and fast. I really hated lying on the concrete garage floor in the past...this tool has eliminated that. 
The main ingredient should be SALT! 750mg per serving and there are 2 servings per can. Come on, we usually sweat or need more salt in the Summer, but we tend to eat more soup in the Winter. My first impression was "boy this is salty". It would be great as a gravy but so is a much cheaper Cambell's cream of mushroom.
I have been a subscriber to Family Fun for 4+ years and I have always enjoyed the magazine.  I don't remember ever being disappointed in an issue.   ---  --- I usually will read a magazine once just for entertainment value and then go back later and sort out the articles & ideas I want to keep on file for future reference.  In most magazines this equates to a few pages to hang on to at the most.  With Family Fun I always end up with a huge stack of ideas that I want to hang on to.  What is even better is that these are tips and bits of information that I actually use and apply in our everyday lives.  Practical, useful and fun are all words I would use to describe this publication. ---  --- My favorite features include:  --- "My great idea" - submitted by readers --- "Family Almanac" - seasonal activities and resources --- and the travel ideas.  We have discovered many great places that our on our list to visit someday and we have even been able to add some wonderful and educational fun to trips we have already had planned. ---  --- Some reviews have complained about the magazine being owned by Disney.  I'm not sure why that is such a problem, but I do realize some people don't like Disney.  The truth is that some major corporation owns just about everything major magazine out there anyway.  At least the Disney company has helped Family Fun gain a bigger audience and provided a fantastic web site as a resource companion to the magazine.  I don't find that Disney is overly promoted (a rarity in the world of Disney I know!) in this magazine.  There are plenty of reviews and references to very non-Disney products such as the Harry Potter series, Shrek movies, and hundreds of travel ideas that have nothing to do with anything related to a Disney enterprise. ---  --- This magazine has definitely earned the 5 star rating
I have used every diaper in the market and narrowed it down to pampers and huggies, I have a big 21 month old baby and been looking for the perfect night time diaper with no leaks!! My son still fits in the size % diapers but this is the one we specifically use at night and been really happy about it, no leaks, no gel coming out of the diaper and defintely a happy baby when he wakes up in the morning!
This movie classic, is a fabulous movie.  The story represents a common dilemma faced by 1st generation young people whose parents are immigrants. --- Here is this sensitive, kind-hearted fellow, Marty, a butcher, who just wants to meet a nice girl and get married. Nobody really wants him to be happy and have his own life, especially his mother, and his aunt.  These two actors play their character parts perfectly, just like real "battle-axes" from the "old country,"  etc.  They gossip and try to ruin his relationship with a nice girl he has just met. It is hilarious and entertaining and very true to life.  I love watching this movie over and over
I've been a fan of Carol Dweck's scholarly work for years. Her work on self-esteem, self-concept, and the incremental vs. entity theories of intelligence provides some of the most powerfully useful tools I've encountered for educators and parents in their work with children, as well as in their own self-awareness and lives. I'm delighted to see this information written here in such a user-friendly conversational tone, rich with stories that illustrate the nuances and complexities of Dweck's research and ideas. I'm recommending this book to all of my graduate students (teachers and principals working with gifted learners), as well as to parents of high-ability children. ---  --- Dona Matthews, Ph.D., Director of the Hunter College Center for Gifted Studies and Education, City University of New York
My 15 month old daughter received this as a gift, and I have to admit she loves it, but it has nothing to do with the product design. She would love any toy shopping cart at this stage. She just loves pretend cooking, eating, and feeding her baby doll.  ---  --- This toy is so shoddily made it's laughable. Some of the included foods to put in the cart are actually just cardboard boxes that wind up torn and in the garbage within the first 48 hours. The cart basket is too small, the baby gets stuck in the seat, and my daughter gets frustrated when parts of the cart fall off as she plays. It's not going to last long. The best parts are the little milk carton and the banana. ---  --- Check out other shopping cart toys (little tykes or small world toys).  We bought her a set of wooden fruit (melissa and doug). When this shopping cart dies, we'll buy her a sturdy one and add more wooden food toys (there are some excellent sets available). My advice is skip this one and buy your child something better the first time around
I was interested in Dante's thoughts on hell, religion, and the afterlife as taught by the Catholic church at the time of its writing.  What I got was a detailed political history of Medieval Italy.  This book is great for the first few chapters, but then it becomes a repetitive saga.  Synopsis of the each chapter of the Inferno: Go to next layer of hell; describe in 20 words or less the torture found there; make fun of some political opponents, Catholic church officials, and so forth; prepare for further descent.  In my opinion, this book resides somewhere between the 21st and 22nd layers of hell.  Canto three pretty much has it right.... 'Leave all hope, ye that enter
This book is not about India or Indians.  Shallow characters.  Non existant plot.  A dismal end to a not terrible beginning.  Unlike one of the other reviewers, I was unlucky enough to buy this book - what a waste
Great price - aprons are perfect for my mom.  She just recently suffered a stroke and I needed inexpensive aprons to easily put over her head for when she eats that look nice and does the job.  The Company sent them out right away; would order again. Just wish they had more colors and designs to choose from.  I order two packages, with 3 in each package
This hoop is tight, but wene you shoot it makes a ton of noise. If your planing on buying this be aware of a lot noise. Also the hoop, and the net sometimes come off

Oh! How I will never forget seeing the re-release of this film. --- It was in 1974 and I could not keep my eye's from it.It is now --- 2006 and I still can't.What this movie is to me is a place in --- my heart and being a avid collector of films from the silents --- to the classics and obscure I find that very meaningful.If you --- have not seen 7th you are missing out. It truly is a funtastic --- film.I put this above Jason and the argonauts for my reason --- alone(I KNOW I STAND ALONE IN THIS FOR JASON HAS MORE  --- monsters and the great Ray Harryhausen has said JASON --- is his fav.along with many of his fans).What 7th has above --- Jason for me is MUSIC! A soundtrack to a film has always --- been a extra push to a film and the 7th voyage has that --- extra push on Jason.Bernard Herrman's score is so dreamlike --- you can close your eyes and leave 7th on and the music is  --- trancelike especially the snake woman dance.Please anyone --- who reads this have 7th voyage in your collection(Jason --- & the argonauts too for that matter).You wont be dissapointed --- I will always be grateful to have seen this on the big screen --- and never forget it,I hope when you watch Ray Harryhausen's --- children and Bernard Herrman's music come to life you too --- will not forget it.Some say Gone with the wind,Wizard of Oz --- Casablanca,Citizen Kane,Jaws, Star Wars(77), Superman(78) --- E.T. Titanic,2001 a space & Pulp Fiction.Not me! If I was --- on a island and could only have one film from my library --- (ouch!I have alot of films and alot I love)but I would --- have to pick The Seventh Voyage.That would be the one  --- for me on the island.And please let it be the isle of --- colossus. --- 
Poor design and fit, such that after 4-5 wears, the front of both shoes wore out - into a hole.  Not recommended
Great concept, but bad design. Both of my children have had one for a year. Due to the discomfort, they never use it! It needs to recline back further and the plastic is slippery making it hard to sit without slipping around
I liked this movie when i first saw it and i seen it about 10 times... i like to watch any movie that involves gangs (especially bloods & crips) so i can learn from them... ---  --- If you're looking or are just a collector like me of gang movies... you may not want this one in your collection... becuase to me, it doesn't show enough Bloods & Crips in it.... the characters are fictional....there are some minor gangs in it as well called The White Fences (Latino/Hispanic gang - i've never heard of this gang, so i don't know if they are true or not.). ---  --- The actors who play the gang members of the White Fences are good actors though... i think they are better then Don Cheadle and Wayans who play Crip members... this movie centers more on White Fence and their rivalry w/ Crips... there's not too much focus on Bloods in here... it also more focuses on Sean Penn's character and Robert Duvall too (good cop/bad cop), and Penn on how he falls in love w/ a former gangmember woman in the White Fence gang. ---  --- Colors is a good watch...i just wish it had more gang focus in it...and more gang sets (chapters, i.e. Eight Tray Gangsters, Hoover, etc...) If you're looking for a good gang buy, buy the book "Monster" by Sanyika Shakur a.k.a. Monster Kody Scott, or "Do Or Die" by Leon Bing. Those 2 books far surpasses this movie..
This instant oatmeal is the only one I have had that tastes like real oatmeal.  It does not have that artificial taste that most instant oatmeals have
My son is 5 months old now and for the first 4 months, the monitor worked pretty well.  We got a bit of static from time to time, but I would have given it 4 stars.  BUT...one night I woke up to reassure myself with the little green "on" light and saw that the monitor was not on.  Thinking it was a fluke, I turned it back on, checked the baby and went to bed.  But, over the course of a couple of weeks, it became more and more unreliable, turning off at will.  It was also hard to turn it back on.  I had to flip the switch several times before it would work. And, this is not a battery issue, since it was plugged in the entire time. I went to the Evenflo website and read the FAQs.  There's a mention of a problem with the power light going out, but nothing about the monitor itself going out.  Needless to say, we've thrown it away and have gotten a different brand.  I mentioned this to my friend with an 8 month old the other day and she said the same exact thing happened to hers - just stopped working reliably. She's bought a different monitor too.  Both of our new monitors are working perfectly now with less static.  I wouldn't recommend purchasing this monitor until they make some changes.
Shaving gives me all sorts of problems, I must have super sensitive skin or something. I cannot afford laser and wax just isn't my thing.  --- Grabbed this for myself before Christmas on a whim. It was money well spent! --- After 3 months of use, I have gotten the hang of the product. I suggest you practise then shave regularly for a month or more. Say, run the product over each leg once till you get used to it. Then trying to completely remove the hair. My legs are unbelievably soft. No rash, one little tender area after I spent too much time there. Do keep moving and keep a razor in the cabinet just in case. I still have trouble around my ankles. --- Hair regrowth is markedly thinner since I began using it. By about half. What remains still grows long but I'm, err, what does one call this process? - doing it once a week and only takes a few minutes
This tiny alarm clock is really cool. You have to read the manual and adjust how big and bright you want the projection on the ceiling. You can also adjust how loud and different patterns you want the alarm sound. It tells the temperature also. I liked it so much I bought my Mom one
After the incredible "Monkey Island" series was halted, I feared that I would never find another series of games that had such imaginative storylines, entertaining dialogue, and lush scenery. Then "Bully" came along, and I was hooked. This really is a great game, and you shouldn't be set against it because it's really nothing at all like Grand Theft Auto. There's no blood, no sexuality (except for kissing), and there's so many involving and engrossing storylines. The characters are also some of the best I've ever seen, each having their own stories and personality. The whole clique thing also reminds you of your days in high school. GET BULLY-- IT'S AN AWESOME GAME. People who like this game should also look at the "Monkey Island" series of games for PC and PS2, and the "Nancy Drew" series for PC
Love this item...second one I bought.  Purchased one for my Dodge Ram, then sold it, bought new Nissan Titan and wanted another receiver step, as I left the other one in the Ram I sold
A movie to enjoy watching many times. Very entertaining and light.
yo money. This book really puts it all into perspective. I like fish and gritts. after reading this book I can break doors and stuff. I am one with the universe. Gard your gril
If you have always wanted a turn based strategy game in a fantasy setting with no limits then Dominions II is really the only option out there. Its not perferct but its darn good. ---  --- The story, if you can really call it that, is that the world of Dominions once had one god. One day he just wasn't there all of a sudden and everybody and their brother decided to try and apply for his job. All of these "pretender gods" have to kill off all the other gods and put their religions out of commision in order to take over the world and become a true god. To start up a new game of Dominions II you need to choose from one of the 17 different empires and then pick your pretender god from dozens of different avatars. You can play as darn near anything you can imagine from the ordinary, like the arch-mage, to the outrageously exotic, like the fountain of blood. Every pretender god has strengths and weaknesses and some may be adept at only one or two paths of magic while others may learn many with ease. You also pick a castle and set up your own "dominion" which is the effect your god has on his followers as his religion spreads across the world.  ---  --- But that isn't all, you still haven't actually started a game yet. Next you have to create the game by picking from one of nearly a dozen huge maps and setting all of the game settings such as victory conditions and the difficulty of neutral provinces. And lets not forget, you also choose which of the 17 empires will be playing and if they will be human or AI players. ---  --- The game itself is huge and has very few limits. Your empires unique units may be built in any province in which you have built a castle but every proince in the game also has its own units that may be built there to inculde many that none of the empires usually have access to. Plus units may be equiped with different armor and weapons and as such there may well be hundreds of unique units in the game with maybe even thousands of different equipment varaitions. Like the pretender gods, units come in a huge array from simple, like the light infantry, to the wild, like werewoles and vampires. Combine that with the fact that there are hundreds of spells in the game to research, hundreds of magic items to forge and find, and random events almost every turn, no two games will ever end the same way and the game has nearly unlimited replyability. ---  --- Combat is a bit unsual. All units, in order to move around the map or attack, have to be assigned to a commander. Commanders are built in the same way you recruit normal units but they can only lead so many men. However, you can assign units under a commander to as many squads as you like and each squad as well as the commander himself can be issued a specific order such as casting spells, using ranged weapons or attacking certain foes on the battle field. The downside of all this is that you have to set up all of this before hand during your turn. Combat occours in between turns and you have no control over the battle. Its entirely up to your units to follow the plan you laid out for them.For better or worse this system is certainly original. ---  --- But some things about the game really bother me. My biggest complaint with the game has to be the computer AI. Its not thats its too stupid or too smart. Its actually a bit like the terminator, it allways seems to know where you are and sends wave after wave of seemingly endless foes after you. It can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargined with and it won't stop until one of you is dead. With no diplomacy options and units like spys, assassins and scouts being extremely rare and expensive most games aginst the AI just deteroiate into massive rushing attacks with huge armies killing each other over and over with gods throwing spells at each other turn after turn. ---  --- Another problem with the game is the manual which is huge but contains no information that isn't easily available in the game. Its the same problem Evil Genius had, the manual is awful and all the hints that should hae been in the manual are hidden in the games loading screens. I hope you can read fast. The grapics obviously aren't exactly on par with Half Life 2 or Doom 3 but they work, however I've got to take issue with the music and sound which is downright AWFUL. You better get used to hearing the same three music tracks over and over.  ---  --- Over all, Dominions II is by far the best turn based fantasy game I've ever played. Room for improvement is obviously here but this game should keep you occupied for a long time
These notebooks seem like a pricey investment but they're well worth it. I use mine for meetings, journaling, and sketching out ideas. Not only is it sturdy enough to take a beating, but it has a touch of class that a legal pad can't match.
After slogging through a number of these reviews it is clear that most cannot see that we Twenty-First Century Americans were not the intended audience for this movie. The movie was intended to be a unifying morale-builder for the National Socialist Party in Germany, which had been in power only about a year when this movie was made.  ---  --- From its loss of World War I until the NSDAP was elected to power in Germany in 1934, the people had suffered every kind of internecine mob warfare, illegal abuse and theft of whole portions of Germany at the hands of the French, and an economic catastrophe that made our American Depression look like a picnic by comparison.  ---  --- This movie sought to persuade Germans (GERMANS!) that this dreadful misery was finally over and that the criminal Bolshevik traitors responsible for Germany's defeat in World War I, and all the residual woes, would be defeated once and for all. It must have been a most welcome message because as you watch the film you certainly don't get the impression that anyone had to beg the many thousands of Germans who attended the NSDAP rallies to stand up and cheer their hearts out.  ---  --- If you speak and understand German, you'll have a much greater likelihood of being able to understand the impact of these rallies, and this film that celebrates them. For many who are not conversant in the German language or who know little about the actual history of the time besides what they were exposed to in American World War II films, the film is actually pretty boring after a while.   ---  --- You sit there and watch one group of soldiers, police, or workers after another, marching and marching and marching. This is interspersed with speeches by Hitler and the other Party officals. From time to time you'll see interesting-looking people doing everyday things, some in costume, but mostly they're just talking, walking, eating, brushing their teeth, and so on. Be advised -- for those of you who expect the whole thing to be a stirring, gigantic SS parade with weapons bristling, be prepared to be disappointed. The last group of soldiers on parade are indeed the SS Leibstandarte Adolph Hitler, and they're marching to what was reputedly Hitler's favorite piece -- "Der Badenweiler". Remember to notice that they aren't even carrying rifles or bayonets.... ---  --- Lastly, in my opinon, the commentary by "historian" Dr Anthony Santoro is mostly just another sarcastic, demeaning rant against the people in the film, so typical of those who pronounce judgement on the vanquished after every war.  The marching soliders and other Germans who reverberated such thrills of hope for their poor, beleagured country are all long dead, but Santoro must make fun of them for the amusement (?) of the American audience. Try to remember -- this movie was not made for YOU!
They taste good and stop those hunger pangs for quite some time
This is an attractive toy for infants and toddlers. The music and lights are nice.
I have yet to receive my first issue and it has been over 2 months
The connectpro USB KVM Switch costs a few dollars more but it really works the first time with no hassles.  I've been forced to use cheaper KVM switches at work and Windows XP never seems to play nice with them.  I use this one at home with two Linux machines and a desktop and laptop running Windows XP.  The switch worked the first time I connected everything together and has worked glitch free ever since
This gauge works well and is easy to read. It seats well and does mostly what it should. --- There seems to be a lot of misunderstanding from what I have read in other reviews. Let's clear a few things up. --- First of all, you do NOT have to wait ten seconds between readings. You DO have to hit the recall button on the bottom between readings. --- Secondly, you DO NOT have to send the unit back to replace the batteries. The instructions VERY clearly state the model number of user replaceable batteries (if you were to read the instructions). --- The hose was flexible for me in 30 degree weather contrary to what I have read elsewhere. Maybe it gets stiff in really cold weather but then I use mine in the garage. ---  --- Very Nice Gauge
I've been using this since the first beta release, and it has sped up my productivity at work by miles.  The ribbon interface is more upfront with the commands most ofter used, and my old keystroke commands are still there as well.  After changing my default save setting to 97-2003 I have run into no compatibility problems.   ---  --- As with most of the bad reviews on MS products, it seems people are quick to rush with a bad review when they are unable to find or do something as quickly as they have in the past.  My advice is to spend ten minutes looking through all of the menus...  They make sense, and once you get used to it, you'll never want to go back to the old way again.  Everything is cleaner, smoother, faster, and easier to use than ever before, and I have been using Office for longer than I care to admit.  Let go of the past people!  This is the future of business productivity
Graphics aren't the most important part of a game to me.  I already owned Oblivion when I bought Gothic 2 because I was hoping it would be a darker and more mature "Oblivion" style RPG. ---  ---   While it does have much more mature content than Oblivion,.. I never got to see it because of the bad controls,.. bad collision and lack of fun.  (By bad collision I'm talking about your character walking through or getting stuck on objects.) ---    The only weapons you can find at first are a tree branch and a tiny dagger.  There are no easy enemies to fight for a Level 1 character.  Even the little gremlin looking guys in the first cave by that pond at the beginning totally beat the crap out of you with ease.  The controls make combat an unfun chore. ---  ---   I'm a patient and forgiving gamer but Gothic 2 barely has half the quality of Elder Scrolls 4 : Oblivion.  If you've never played Oblivion and don't have an XBox 360 or a PC that can run it,.. then maybe you'll get into Gothic 2.  It has much lower system requirements
In many ways a relic of its era, "Not of This Earth" is the first widely distributed release by Joe Satriani (a previous EP ended up being reissued as part of "Time Machine", years later).  The guitarist, supported by drummer Jeff Campitelli and percussionist John Cuniberti came into public attention when Steve Vai, a former student of Satriani, ended up singing his teacher's praises in the music press. ---  --- The result is that this album, more than likely to have been lost in the shuffle of instrumental rock music, received wider recognition and poised Satriani to explode into a bonafide celebrity on his next record. ---  --- The album itself is a bit uneven-- Satriani is a flawlessly brilliant guitarist, but as a songwriter, he wasn't quite ready.  Several pieces ("Not of This Earth", "Hordes of Locusts") seem to run out of steam before they end, and a couple ("The Snake", "Driving At Night") feel like bad '80s metal.  On the other hand, several pieces shine-- delicate and lovely "Rubina", reggaeish and emotionally soaked "Memories", and the overtly Frippesque "New Day" are all fine examples of what Satriani is capable of.  But my favorite is probably "Brother John", where Satriani abandons all his effects and performs his delicate and bubbly melody cleantone. ---  --- In the end, the album is ok, but Satriani would go on to do so much more interesting in the future.  Come back to this one if you've picked up a bunch of other stuff and are looking for more, but most should start with "Surfing With the Alien"
This is a great clock. When I bought it about a week ago, I put the battery in the clock, and placed it on the wall in my family room where my old clock used to be. That was it. At first the clock appeared to be broken but within 5 minutes it adjusted itself and has been running perfectly ever since. This clock can be seen clearly in my family room from 25ft away. As I get older I like things to be bigger and this clock gets the job done while still looking attractive. My wife likes the clock because she does not confuse the short hand with the long hand from a distance
I'm going to the trouble of writing this review to warn you: this cd is not like the other Putumayo cds. No, it is not fun, hip, relaxing, good to dance to, or stimulating. It is a selection of hackneyed Sinatra-style slop sung by a variety of leery-sounding men with fake deep voices. I have this rule for music: if it makes me think of animated dogs kissing over pasta, it sucks. Consider yourself warned. If you like good music, try French Cafe instead
The first time I used these push-up bars the flimsy plastic they're made out of cracked in three different places.  Perhaps they will still hold up and not fail entirely, but I'm not going to risk an injury finding out.  In the trash they go... I suggest you buy some that are made out of metal tubing
The previous reviews about this product were absolutely correct. The description of this product is a misnomer. The heating pad never heats up, and takes forever to just  warm up. On a scale of 1 to 5, I would rate it a zero! Don't waste your money on this. I will be returning mine
I'm very very picky about my action movies and this one is worth the trouble.  Story line shmory line, this is an ACTION movie.  I watch my action movies for action not a lesson in philosophy and religion.  Kind of a heartbreaking movie, though, because he's dead no matter what.  The man can't sleep or he slips in a coma.  Going out with a bang with a freefall from a helicopter telling his woman how much he loved her... that's a film.  You won't regret owning this, I promise you. ---  --- p.s.  It is very possible that the negative reviewers are crackbabies.  That is all
I was down in Antarctica when I turned on the camera and it said "lens error". After a day of missing some of the best pictures of Emperor Penguins with my 8800, I twisted the lens and got it to work. The same thing happened to me in Bolivia, just after the warranty expired. I called Nikon and they insist there is no problem with the camera. Do a Google search of "lens error" and Nikon 8800 and you will find lots of unhappy people with the same experience. This is my third and last Nikon
As a lover of many types of music, this movie sparked my interest....so I rented it.  I found myself thinking throughout the movie "I can't believe I'm actually watching this.  What a waste!"  Not only was the plot slow to the point of boring, but the film exalted lesbianism to the point that I (as a grown woman) actually fast-forwarded through a couple of scenes.  The small amount of goodness in the movie was not worth all of the disappointing twists and turns of the story.  Also, please carefully consider before allowing children to watch!! I will NEVER, under any circumstances watch this movie again. (I want the reader to know that I am in no way a movie critic.  I am writing this strictly as someone who wishes to steer others away from what I found to be a complete waste of an evening.
I just paid $15 dollars (after shipping) for this cheap looking plastic popcorn bowl that was supposed to be a gift for my sister. Bah Humbug!!! Did I mention it is plastic. IT'S PLASTIC!!!!
These are very tasty. Not too sweet like some bars, but plenty sweet enough. Nice fruity flavor - my favorite of the three EnviroKidz bars. Even if I didn't need to eat gluten-free, these would be a favorite snack.
Pupsqueak is wonderful. I am a picky mother about toys. I hate toys that are too loud, too commercial, too cheesy, too useless...I have high standards. But Pupsqueak gets my "picky mom seal of approval" wholeheartedly. Here's why. ---  --- I am very blessed to have a mother who loves to send my children lots of goodies. While it's easy to know what to send a 4-year-old with distinct likes and interests, it can be harder to gauge what a twelve-week-old baby will enjoy. We have no shortage of toys and gadgets to entertain our new daughter with, and she clearly enjoys some of them, kicking legs, cooing, , waving arms, etc. ---  --- The Pupsqueak, however, took it to a different level. She LOVES this thing. We showed it to her around 11-12 weeks old, and she immediately reacted. She laughed, she kicked, all the signs. Then, she reached for the little black and white patterned bone that hangs down. We were so excited, and she's had it attached to the bar on her carseat ever since. The real test, however, was our 10-hour drive from Louisiana to Kentucky for the Thanksgiving holidays. But Pupsqueak came through for us with flying colors: anytime she would get fussy, I could reach back and shake him a bit so he would jingle softly, and she would be happy again. After my arm would get tired, I'd make sure he was adjusted where she could get at him, and she would, at not yet 4 months, bat at it herself. ---  --- Pupsqueak is a wonderful toy with a soft, gently jingle for young babies and a funny bark that even makes my four-year-old laugh for older babies. He is definitely top dog in my book
My engineering classes don't allow for the TI-83,86,89.  So I needed a calculator that allowed for matrix reduction, basic vector manipulation, and single variable integration for my engineering class.  The matrix reduction capabilities has been a major time saver especially on tests, particularly for solving systems of linear equations especially in my Statics, Dynamics, and Strength of Materials Class.  The "2-Line Natural Textbook Display" prevents me from getting lost in a calculation with multiple parenthetically nested expressions and is a must have.  The "scrolling" ability to grab values from previous calculations saves time and preserves accuracy, very nice.  The only thing preventing a 5 star rating is that I thought the exterior design make is awkward to use at times, but that is because I'm used to square calculators.  Also I would have like this model offered in black
Touchstone features articles, editorials, book reviews and other material from the perspective of Protestant (both mainline and evangelical), Catholic and Orthodox Christians who hold to traditional, orthodox understandings of Christian morality.  It tackles the tough issues of our time both in scholarly articles and practical advice for parents who must raise children to be faithful in a post-Christian culture.  While it does not seek a false ecumenicalism which demands unity at all cost (see the July/August 2003 issue on "Christian Unity & the Divisions we must Sustain"), it also recognizes that orthodox believers of all three major branches of Christianity must work together on moral issues on which we all agree. ---  --- The publisher, the St. James Fellowship, also produces an excellent devotional guide: The St. James Daily Devotional Guide for the Christian Year, available by subscription though [...]
The item is sloppy looking and feeling, unlike the photo of the black Ellaroo.  I didn't feel that the baby was secure and she rode so low on my side that one could hardly call it a hip. Maybe I just never got it adjusted correctly but I read the instructions and gave it many tries.  However, on a positive note, I was refunded my money with no problem.  There was a small restock fee which was disclosed up front.  So, I have no problem with the seller. 
A good friend of mine insisted I'd read this book, because she knows I love exploring the spiritual aspects of life.  ---  --- In the end I was very disappointed.  Not in the writing or the exploration aspects of the book, but Michael Crichton's whole attitude.  He would spend a chapter sharing his learnings and his eye opening experiences, only to revert back to his arrogant, narrow-minded attitude once again for the next chapter.  How can anyone claim they've learned anything in life when nothing they learn from it seems to sink in? ---  --- Sadly, this book left me with a very bad taste in my mouth.  I have no desire to read any more of his books
Product works great!!!  Used it up against Sam's club mechanic and it passed with flying colors.  Would purchase it again.  Try it, you'll like it. 
A sports bra is supposed to keep the jiggling in check when you exercise, but this one doesn't.  Also, the construction leaves something to be desired.  It's very scratchy around the back of the straps and the hooks, where the seams are sewn.  I bought two.  After trying them several times, I gave up and sent them to charity.  Don't bother
Generally like the program. Hoped it came with a CD to practice in the car but was wrong. It is totally PC based. I'll let you know in about three months if I can actually conduct business in Deutsch.
Gibson and Weaver star in theis steamy view of the fall of imperialism in Indonesia.  They start living the expat life in Jakarta, and live the transformation as the country moves to military rule.  The movie is interesting on many fronts:  Seeing the leads before they became megastars, watching the subtle condemnation of expats amongst locals, and the history woven into the fiction.  Supporting roles are played superbly as well.  It's a great movie
Great product. I just received my ball today. I couldn't wait to work out. If I learn how to stay on it that would be saying something! I will always recommend Max-Fitness
Right, so by putting a review down for this album, I am getting labeled as an emo kid who wears his sweater too tight, cuts himself and cries over his girlfriend all day long, well too bad that's not me, I am just a normal person who can tell the diference between bad and good music. Hawthorne Heights is an emo band who are criticised by lots and loved by lots of others, I have to agree that their lyrics are quite simplistic and are used over and over, they might even sound gay at some points, although, "we are so last year" made me laugh "I should have known you better, i should blame it on the weather" wtf is that??? Anywyas so the lyrics are probably the reason why I'm giving this 4 and not 5. But here we're talking music not lyrics. The music has nothing very special to it and I can play every song on guitar, they often use the same chords except for a few songs "This Is Who We Are", but they have a lot of interesting melodies and don't just rely on power chords to make their music interesting. Even though these chord sequences are often re-used, Hawthorne Heights always manage to make their sound diverse and interesting and they are slowly imposing themsleves as the kings of knock-out choruses. The other thing I have noticed in this album is that there are much less screaming parts which is an improvement and the guitarist has finally learnt where his place is in the band (behind his guitar) but also when is a good time to scream and when it isn't. This makes them quite different from most other emo bands who literaly destroy their sound with high shrieks. Hawthorne have become a little darker and even tune down their guitars in some of their songs now adding a bit more heavyness. Also check out "Where can I stab myslef in the ears" to see how hawthorne have improved. Overall this is a step forward from their last album, it won't change the emo scene forever, but it will leave its mark in your memories and will give you a good moment when listening to it
I bought these lollipops for my allergic kids, because these are the only lollipops I have found that don't contain corn.  Not only do my kids love them, but so do my coworkers!  They are delicious - much more flavorful than your usual boring lollipops.  Watermelon is the office favorite so far..
After leaving (or being dismissed from) Pink Floyd in 1968 due to his LSD use & erratic behaviour, singer/songwriter/guitarist Syd Barrett re-emerged in 1970 with his debut solo album, "The Madcap Laughs." The album did not come easy, as Syd never fully recovered from his drug use, and it clearly shows in his ragged performances on "Madcap Laughs." Producer Malcolm Jones did what he could with Syd for about half of the album, before handing the production reigns over to Barrett's former Floyd mates Roger Waters & David Gilmour to finish the job. Throughout the album, bum notes are played, beats are missed, and Barrett sings off-key. And on the rocker songs, the session players (from the group The Soft Machine) sound like they are struggling to keep up with Syd, who could hit a rough patch at any moment. For any other artist, this would all be nothing short of disastrous. And YET....in the case of Syd Barrett, any and all mistakes are immediately forgiven. Why? Because Barrett's songs on "The Madcap Laughs" are all wonderfully written, and although Syd's voice and guitar-playing are obviously not in tip-top condition, you can plainly hear on this album that he's trying. He's really, really *trying* to do his best, and his efforts really do shine through. For every bum note there's a passage that Syd plays beautifully, for every missed beat there are many beats that are hit right on schedule, and for every note that Syd sings off-key, there are many moments where his very distinctive, British voice is magical. And of course, there's Syd's lyrics. You may not know what all of them actually *mean*, really, but to my ears, they're still poetry. The rockers are still powerful ("No Good Trying," "No Man's Land," the rockabilly fun of "Here I Go," and the classic "Octopus"), and the softer numbers still have great beauty to them ("Terrapin," the passionate "Dark Globe," the effective "Golden Hair"---based on a James Joyce poem---and "Long Gone"). Even the more ragged numbers like "Feel" and "If It's In You," somehow still hang together quite well (amusingly, we even hear some brief banter from Syd in the middle of "If It's In You," as his voice goes wildly off the map, he stops playing, prepares for another take, and finally gets through the song). When all is said and done, "The Madcap Laughs," warts and all, is an excellent album. It is a flawed masterpiece, and it shows that Syd Barrett, even with his mind irreversibly fractured by this point, was still a genius musician.   
I have a 2 year old and have seen him on all the Kids Channels.  I was hoping the DVD would show each of his songs as they are performed on TV.  Instead it was like a concert and did not keep my attention nor my sons.  This would have been a better CD instead of a DV
What else needs to be said. Even with a low-end Graphics card this Masterpiece is FUN! Perfect combination for a laptop/notebook. Too bad Sir William Gates won't allow a PC version of Halo 2. Well anyways seeya in Halo 3 Deathmatc
I really tried to come to this movie with and open mind. I'm a huge fan of Jane Austen and I thought the 1995 BBC miniseries actually came close to doing justice to her novel. Still, I was looking foreward to seeing a new interpretation. Unfortunately this one seemed to miss the point of the story.  ---  --- Jane Austen had a hilarious way of satarizing the social conventions and mores while being in their midst. This film ignores the social conventions altogether and therefore misses a great deal of Austen's humor. For example an unmarried man and woman would NEVER greet each other in their pajamas. A man would never visit his fiancee while she was lying sick in bed in her nightgown. When these rules of propriety are ignored by the film, how are we supposed to understand or believe that it's a big deal when Lydia runs away with Wickham!? Another example is Lady Catherine. This is a woman who lives and dies by her snobbery and rigorous adherance to social conventions. Yet in this film we see her barge into the Bennet household in the middle of the night and wake Lizzie up to ask a question that could easily waited until morning (when Lady Catherine wouldn't have had to get her carriage driver out of bed to drive several miles in the dark- no streetlights remember- to the Bennet household) Because no one adhere's to societies rigorous, and for the most part arbitrary, rules, the movie misses the opportunies to subtly wink at the audience as it laughs at such things. ---  --- Another weakness lies in the casting. Granted these actors had big shoes to fill. Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle seemed to embody their characters in the 1995 miniseries, but as I said, there are other ways to interpret and play the characters. Unforunately here everyone seems as if they're reading lines with dramatic inflection- not acting. You can almost imagine Keira Knightly's script having notes saying "insert spunkiness here".   ---  --- While the scenery is lovely, the windswept cliff and farm images seem to recollect the tortured landscape of a Bronte adaptation more than a manacured Austen setting.  ---  --- Overall this film comes off as one big missed opportunity
Great purchase -- good price, easy.  what more could you want
The music contained Trout Mask Replica is some of the most unique, acid-drenched art to ever be pressed. The songs on the album are mainly divided into folkish a capella tunes and the crazed jams the Captain and his band are known for. Several strange, unconventional themes are visited and revisted throughout the track list, such as bulbs, gingham, trout, and a variety of other surreal, sensously described wildlife. However, if there's any reason to buy Captain Beefheart's Trout Mask Replica, it's to listen to the album as a whole. I find it difficult to listen to any other way. While I find this to be true, I do have favorites that I go to when introducing friends to the Captain, or simply jamming out to without dedicating myself to the full experience: "Ella Guru", "Dachaus Blues", "Dust Blows Forward", "Neone Meat Dream", and "Old Fart at Play" stick out
A nice idea that doesn't provide adequate audio quality in my experience. The unit would pick up "noise" from the operation of my CD player, resulting in a background squealing that was especially audible between tracks. In addition, on trips I had to frequently flip through the various frequency settings to avoid conflicts with radio stations
I TOTALLY disagree with the reviewers that say it smells strong and like a granny! I don't know what they're smelling, but obviously it's not this. It does smell a little stronger at first than it does when the fragrance has settled in, but it certainly doesn't smell like any granny I've ever smelled. I always get compliments when I wear this fragrance (which is every day)- complete strangers will come up to me and tell me how good I smell. I recommend starting with the body emulsion and then lightly spritzing the fragrance (1 spray should do the trick).
I would not recommend this product for anyone over 3 & 1/2 years (unless small for their age).  My 4 yr old son (36lbs) got it for his birthday, and broke the steering wheel within 10 minutes.  There is plenty of room for him on the seat and inside the car, but its been "parked" since broken.  I wish we would have spent the money on something that would have lasted.  The plastic seems cheaply made.  The voice buttons and noises are loud and work well.  Stickers have already started to flake/peel off after 1 month.  Consider a bigwheel
While I love Billie, in her own words, these sessions were dull, and uninspired. Since the reviews should focus on one CD, that is the jist of it; boring renditions, and back up musicians that are not the ones that  Billie was used to making for a very uneven collection
I'll start out by saying that I prefer the Jason movies.  I think the whole body count is a fun way to watch a horror movie.  The Freddy movies are good horror movies, but they're not really slashers like I thought they would be. ---  ---  - A Nightmare on Elm Street -  ---  --- A great, classic horror movie by Wes Craven.  He creates good high school characters, although trying to prove that they're only 15 years old is a little far-fetched.  Freddy is more horrific and scary, he doesn't say much. ---  --- - A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge -  ---  --- They were asking for it when they completely changed the style and rules of Freddy in this sequel.  Many will disagree, but I don't think it's a bad movie, it's just very dark and horrific. ---  --- - A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors -  ---  --- Definately a step up from Part 2.  It goes back to the roots of the original film and brings back Nancy, who is now studying dreams and sleep in a mental hospital.  The style brings us back to the original movie with the same rules and objectives. ---  --- - A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master -  ---  --- Decent entry in the series carrying over characters from #3 and introducing all new characters.  The story doesn't flow as easily this time around and it's a step down from Part 3, but still good. ---  --- - A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child - ---  --- Stephen Hopkins' visual style makes this the best sequel in the series.  Freddy is hilarious and the special effects are great.  The story is more interesting than Part 4 and the characters have matured since that movie which is good. ---  --- - Freddy's Dead - The Final Nightmare -  ---  --- Cheesy storyline trying to tell us that in 10 years there will be no kids left in an American town?  Rachel Talalay thinks the 3-D effects in the film are lame, but not that story element?  If it weren't for the interesting backstory on Freddy, this wouldn't be a good movie. ---  --- - Wes Craven's New Nightare -  ---  --- Wes Craven did succeed in making an interesting and well made horror movie here, but it is a little strange to include it in the rest of the series.  Better watched on its own and not consecutively with the other movies. ---  --- - Nightmare Encyclopedia -  ---  --- Alot of interviews that aren't edited very interestingly make for a decent special features disk.  It's good to see that these interview aren't self serving at all and they're completely retrospective, it would've been nice to hear more from Heather Langenkamp, or possibly Johnny Depp? ---  --- This is a great set for extreme fans and a good set for casual fans.  I'm a huge fan of the Alien series and a pretty big fan of the Predator series, but not as much as Alien.  I would say that I'm now a huge fan of Jason and a good sized fan of Freddy in comparison to Alien/Predator.  I do recommend these movies, but this enormous box with annoying cardboard cases is outdated for today
My 7 yr. old son is allergic to mosquito bites, plus I'm concerned about West Nile virus.  Unfortunately, mosquitoes love him, and he always get some really nasty bites when he is sleeping.  I bought this little unit, and now have peace of mind!  I turn this on in his room for about half an hour at bedtime, leaving his door open, then turn it off and close his door.  Any mosquitoes lurking in his room have been driven out by the geranium scent.  I do the same in my own bedroom, and I am very pleased with the results. ---  --- The geranium scent is rather strong, but not unpleasant.  I don't find it necessary to leave this on all night, so it's not a problem.  I also like that you can clip this on your belt and turn it on for when you are outside.  It's just a tiny little fan blowing through the geranium scented cartridge, so it is small and light-weight
I haven't received this item.  It has been almost two months
The gameplay and overall feel of this game screams Castlevania. The sidescrolling platform action is spot on, the graphics truly push the limits of the DS, and the variety of equipment/soul combinations will lend itself perfectly to creating a gameplay experience perfect for your style of play. ---  --- As people have said in past reviews, the use of the touch screen feels tacked on. To defeat bosses you have to draw symbols on the screen, which can be frustrating if a) you have poor penmenship, or b) are left-handed (such as yours truly) and have to scramble to take the stylus out, switch it to your other hand, and draw the symbol. It's a neat little addition but, again, it didn't really need to be there. ---  --- Also, the boss battles are sometimes a little too easy, even in the later levels. Don't get me wrong, there are some that are just downright nasty, but some of the bosses fire off their special weapon and all you can do is look at the screen and go "... that's it?" ---  --- Overall, this is another great game for the Nintendo DS. With the exception of the clunky touch screen addon, the game is overall fantastic
This was a top-notch game.  I really enjoyed playing it.  It was a well-designed, thoroughly enjoyable shooter.  The good looking girl calling you "cowboy" all the time was a bit silly (especially since my wife was also playing the game at the same time I was). ---  --- If you've already played Halo and you're looking for a different but enjoyable shooter then try this one
I read some reviews that there were some compatability issues with this sensor and the main unit. However, I had no trouble at all getting this sensor to work with my existing unit and sensor, once I realized I need to reset the main unit in order for it to recognize the newest sensor. I have one sensor outside in my garage and the other downstairs in my basement and they both work well and are pretty accurate with the actual temperature. This was an excellent purchase
    --- I've used Paris Hilton perfume for about a year now.  Ordering it online at Amazon was terrific.  I didn't have to drive, and the price is half the amount you would spend in the department store!!! --- If you haven't tried this fragrance, please do so.  You will be wonderfully surprised at how special it makes you feel! ---                                                      Donna ---  ---                                                 
Though the description of this product says it's filled with natural buckwheat hulls and rice, mine had a strong smelling deodorant coming from the removable bags you heat. I used them once and then packed them away because I do not like the odor. I wish the mitts had been unscented. Perhaps over time, or by next winter, the odor will be gone and I'll get some use out of them
I wanted a simple printer so I could print a few prints from time to time to hand out. On sale for $50, this seemed like the right one.  ---  --- I already had the included Zoombrowser and Photo Stitch software installed from my prior purchase of a Canon A95 camera, so I just needed to install the driver. Note this requires a USB cable (not included) to the printer. ---  --- As is human nature, I tried to print without reading the Zoombrowser instructions, and got a lovely plain sky-blue print with the words "My Album" on it - but no photo :-) Then, out came a stunning second print which was totally blank but with some faint horizontal lines - this was from a residual click from my first attempt. Ok, Ok, so I looked at the PDF printing guide for about 15 seconds, and followed the instructions. ---  --- Got a beautiful first print of the Queen Mary ship. Got a gorgeous second print of flags (red/white/blue, and green) againt a clear blue sky, and the third print was very nice of a field of flowers near Mt Lassen (ironically the original proof print of this from 20 years ago was scanned onto my computer just today to get rid of paper prints...) ---  --- So, I've blown through the provided "trial" 5 sheets of paper and film cartridge, and have 3 very nice prints (with postcard address lines, stamp area and Canon logo on the back - the paper comes that way.) The ends of the paper remain white but have perforations about 1/2 inch from the end so you can remove them after printing. ---  --- I can't compare the printing software to any other brand, but setting up a plain photo-only print takes about 10 seconds of menu choices. If you want to add backgounds, titles/text, etc, that is available as well. (Got another pack of paper/film, and put humorous captions on kind of funny-bad office Christmas pix...) ---  --- Printing directly from my A95 takes about the same time as from the computer - about 1 min 45 sec. ---  --- The actual operation involves the paper being passed in and out of the printer 4 times (3 color passes and a protective layer) so it is important the back of the printer is not obstructed, particularly by the power cord which hangs down near the edge of the slot. The finished print is deposited on top of the paper cassette in front.   ---  --- The unit looks and feels substantial for its small size, comes well packed (survived NY to CA shipping), has decent documentation, and a 1-year warranty.
i just got my new camcorder and start to operate it. first of all is's very easy to operate with the joystick, the use in the still image function is allways available, even while shooting a video (nice feature but as all camcorders - low quality pitures) the stabalizer (one of the reason why i'd preffered that cam over the other) is great and even in full zoom you can get pretty steady videos. the large zoom (X32) is also very nice. overall i think this is great value for my money....
I bought this product thinking that it was so pricey it just had to work. Well it doesn't. I followed the directions and went through two bottles with no results what so ever. I'm 24, 23 when I tried the product... no reason it should not have worked if it actually worked at all. If it doesn't work it should get 1 star because it is not delivering on its promise and the promise is why people buy this stuff. I wish I hadn't listened to the raves on this product
It's only redeemingly quality is the price (if you get a good deal). Photo quality is poor, and screen is quite small (3x5). Navigation is not overly complicated, but buttons must be pushed hard to work. It did work perfectly fine - took SD card, even connected to my Mac and drag and drop photos onto the SD card I inserted into the frame. But, because of the poor quality of the photos, I don't suggest buying
If you like Diablo 1..... this is exactly the same game... only improved 300% percent. If not for Blizzards Bnet and all the multiplayer options I would say that this game is also better than Diablo
ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY really understands the whole arena of entertainment from film to television to DVD to music to games to even hand-held media for your phone like downloads, mobile ringtones and even book reviews. Plus you can search the archives of Entertainment Weekly for almost any article ranging in categories from Pop Culture to Photo Galleries, to their annual lists which include such top ten lists as the hottest American Idol performances ever, most memorable gay couples even before Brokeback Mountain to the most embarrassing sex scenes in the movies. The magazine has been publishing since 1990 so it has chronicled the rise of the star director, star writer, star-producer and the hyphenates -- actor/producers, actor/directors, actor/writers etc. And it's seen the rise of HOLLYWOOD USA and HOLLYWOOD WORLD where popular culture seems to impact every aspect of our lives from how we live to the clothes we wear to the food we eat to the cars we drive. Don't miss their LISTS -- who's who in various categories like the "IT LIST" to the "POWER LIST" to the "ENTERTAINERS OF THE YEAR". 
 ---  --- THE FIRST HALF ---   If they had made movies back then, in 1871, it would move as slowly as this. ---   Perhaps that date suits the film to perfection. --- The days of utter simplicity, with nearly nothing happening.  --- Where maybe days are filled with yourself. --- Not distractions. ---  ---   After half an hour, all I could think was, if this was on TV, not only would everybody switch off, the sh** (show) would be axed. ---   It may even beat so many foregin movies as THE SLOWEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME.  --- But slow really means empty. ---  --- THE OTHER HALF (OF ME) ---   Yet I have since come to learn, by others' reviews, this is a movie which YOU must make, by the mood, or the feeling of dread others speak of. Or else you are left with the feeling of dead. ---   I failed to do that, and without that, the film fails miserably I reckon. Perhaps because I am dead.  ---   So, therefore, I envy those creative creatures of subtle senses. Or whether it was because they were so simple, or easily pleased, which means more modest, more modern.  ---   So, as in real life, it's only the FEELING which makes anything real. ---  --- MY FIRST (OR WORST?) HALF ---   The other part of me thought that, the film being a feature length, they think they can just not try for half an hour, an hour. Such is the problem with many filmakers, even today. When, being a torture, err feature, they should try much harder!! ---    Therefore the atmosphere spoken of in these reviews can only be like saying there is smoke without fire. Virtually nothing happens, and what does makes little sense, as any unconcious creation. ---  --- MY BETTER HALF OF THE SCHIZOPHRENIC ---   But the acting of the lead lady is expressive and genuine, and not being stereotype; is pleasingly real. Weird as suits the role. As are the others natural, with no Hollywood posing. How often have I heard that story - good acting, bad film? Oh I'm sorry, I did it again. ---   The only thing exciting is the title. ---  --- THE WHOLE ---    My conclusion is: I DON'T KNOW WHICH IS MY BETTER HALF, AND WHICH IS MY WORST HALF . . . ? ---   So, all things being unequal, I choose both. I stand and fall by both my views. (I guess that's why God gave us 2 eyes.) ---  ---    I was going to give it only one star* at first, but now I give it merely two**, knowing I'm still mean. ---  I see this movie as perhaps the greatest measure of one's temperament. ---   If you feel better than me, are supernaturally sensitive, or have the patience of a saint to me, add one, two, or three more stars respectively. ---  ---   I intend to watch it again, and then maybe I can give a before and after shot. ---  ---   Please feel free to reject me, write negative comments about me, or scare me. Or kill me. ---  --- [The world's First Amazoning Interactive Review] That makes it fair
This stuff is tasty but caveat emptor: it's glorified non-dairy creamer, which is the first ingredient. Enjoy this with artificially flavored vanilla sandwich cookies
Small holes, unstable, no space for the bum. My daughter cried everytime we tried it. We had a Pool School deluxe baby float before but we left it at the pool and it dissapeared. She loved that one. I could not find it in the store so I bought the Swim School and am regretting it. --- Buy the Pool School!
From Italy's famed milk region, Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz and Tuscan 2% Low Fat Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz are guaranteed to satisfy. The birthplace of the Italian Renaissance is also the birthplace of the world's most delectable beverage, Tuscan Whole Milk. Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo and Dante Alighieritable were known to imbibe in Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz's sweeth frothy goodness. Some say that Milk was the inspiration for the Mona Lisa. ---  --- Now the milk growers of Tuscan have released Tuscan Skim Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz...a lighter taste with less creamy overtones. In my opinion, an improvement over their earlier release and is my libation of choice. Bon appetit
I would like to add to the reviews already posted, especially for anyone considering this lens as an alternative to the 80-400 VR.  This is one of the only times I can remember when I have had the money to buy a Nikon lens, but have not been able to bring myself to do it.  The 80-400 is 6 years old, uses ancient mechanical (slow) focus, and has yet to be updated with VRII technology.  All that, and it still costs more than the pro-quality Canon 100-400 IS, which has Canon's AF-S equivalent too!  That said, I like long yet portable lenses, and after giving myself fits decided to "settle" for the 70-300 because it has VRII and AF-S.  If you are in the same boat then buy this lens, it is a gem for its intended purpose.  I get sharp results wide open at 300, and the light weight more than offsets the slower apertures.  I would have LOVED this lens if it was an f/3.5, but even at 4.5-5.6 I have really been surprised at the results.  Save the $1000+ until Nikon updates the 80-400 dinosaur
Microsoft Office Pro 2003 edition is a good product. It installed easily over Office Pro 1997. I haven't had any problems with it (yet). It relies heavily on online links, you probably should have a fast DSL connection or broadband if you are going to use the online links. --- Update: --- I am using Windows XP with Office Pro 2003 and today was disappointed to find that the Help menu is not as user friendly or helpful as earlier editions
    I recently purchased this Motorola HS805 headset and find it more than adequate. For the price, it is worth every penny. The ability of using AAA batteries puts it above all other headsets in that respect. Nonreplacable rechargable batteries are a gimmick. Once they finally die, your headset is useless. Too expensive to send away to repair. So you throw your headset and charger away and buy a new one. That is good for a company but not for you. ---    Depending on your ear structure the fit can be either formfitting or loose. From reading the other reviews here one can infer this. For me it is formfitting. Also you may infer that the Bluetooth telephone or device it pairs to would make a difference in performance. Some reviewers here felt that this headset had low volume or allowed some static. For me and others, we experienced no such problem.  ---    Best bet is to check the return policy if you find that it doesn't meet your standards. But if it works for your device, you have a headset that goes 16 days of standby and 22 hours of talk time on 1 AAA Alkaline battery!. And you will never be bothered with a charger unless you use rechargable AAA batteries which is a pretty good idea. If it also fits your ear comfortably then you have a winner
Yummy Green Tea Pocky!!!!!  Just make sure you purchase this in the fall/winter months, otherwise it'll melt in the mail.  I would've given this 5 stars, had the Pocky not melted together into a lump
After ridding a only a couple of times this bike began to fall apart. The brakes were faulty to begin with which were repaired soon after purchase. While ridding on an easy trail the seat broke off half way through the ride. With out a seat I had to walk the bike back to the car. I advise extra caution for first time bikers and do a check to make sure all the components are working.  ---    --- 
I subscribed to Hobby Farm and after reading two issues I cancelled it.  ---  --- I read an article in the March/April issue about show birds. Then, I got my May/June issue. Don Schrider, the Communication Director of ALBC, wrote in to correct the story. The article claimed "over 1000" birds at the show, the correction was 11,640 birds were present. The other correction was regarding earlobe color and egg shell color stating there are exceptions to the red earlobe/ brown eggs white earlobes/white eggs.   ---  --- In the Mar/Apr issue I read an article about Guinea hens. In the May/June issue I read another letter from a reader (Dana Manchester a member of the Guinea Fowl Breeders Assoc.) correcting the article in the previous issue. Apparently, Guineas aren't the "watch fowl" they are portrayed to be, but fall victim to predation often. Dana Manchester also corrected the mislabeled photos of Guineas.  ---   --- These may be small errors but how goods is a resource that isn't reliable? ---   --- If errors were the only issues, I may have given the mag 3 stars but the article on manure management in the May/June issue was lacking on many levels. The advise in a nutshell was buy a manure spreader that you can pull around your field, fill'er up and drive. One word of caution according to the article- only use well rotted manure in the garden, but there wasn't one word on how to rot manure.   ---  --- I liked the article about smaller breeds of cattle, "Bigger is Not Better" May/June but we'll have to wait for the next issue to see if any readers step forward with corrections.  ---  --- I am not waiting around.  ---  --- There are a lot books and magazines dedicated to small farms. I like Mother Nature News and I just subscribed to Countryside (my nephew recommended it he owns a small farm, as well). I also like John Seymour's book Self-Sufficient Life and How to Live It. He has an upbeat attitude with a can-do spirit.
Terrible follow up to the first movie. This movie does not hold a candle to the first classic movie staring John Travolta and Olivia Newton John. --- The acting is bad, and it is not worth the money. --- It belongs where most grease belongs ... in a bucket under the sink.
Now that I have this chair, I'm not going to replace it but I have two major complaints about it.  Our son is 20 months old and I still have to put a book wrapped in a dishtowel in the seat so he can comfortably reach the tray or our dining table.  Raising the height doesn't help because the arms of the chair come up so high and so far forward you can't scoot the chair in any closer to a table.  The chair also has a very large footprint--unless you have a very spacious dining area it's hard maneuvering around it.  If I could do it over again, I wouldn't buy this high chair
Never received product. Ordered 6 of the flashlights on Dec. 3 for Christmas presents. E-mailed seller several times to find out where order was, they never answered my e-mails. --- Good way to do business!
I used Tend Skin for a few years and it was the best one that I could find but a few weeks ago I saw a nother product on Amazon called Solution 2 and ordered it instead.  I was a little worried because I was getting good results with the bumps with Tend Skin but it burned a lot and dried out my skin quite a bit.  Solution 2 is definitely a better product for me with my sensitive skin and it works just as good on the bumps

 --- When someone goes to the time and effort to expose the Watertower Bible Company and Death Brokers, they get five stars from me. America is overflowing with former Jehovah's Witnesses that are now living shattered lives. So, the more such books there are saturating the market, the more likely it is someone will read just the right book that will keep them from getting involved in this End Of The World death-cult. Or help a poor suffering JW find their way OUT.  ---  --- David Reed, thank you for both of your fine books. May they be read far and wide and in between!  ---  --- Read I WAS A TEENAGE JEHOVAH'S WITNESS and JEHOVAH UNMASKED for two of the wildest rides ever!
I bought this for my girls when they were six months old and at two years they still like the colorful birds!  This is a great toy, well made and interesting.  This would also be a wonderful gift
My boys love them. They draw in the car and their cup can sit on it. Kinda a pain for short drives, but wonderful for longer trips.
This is the best tasting energy bar I have ever had. My kids love them too. Great high energy snack
Not what I expected.  This bench is ok for a petite woman, not suitable for a man or anyone over 5 feet tall...
I bought one for my son at Christmas and it broke after a month.  It just suddenly wouldn't turn on.  Amazon was great with sending a replacement in just two days, before even getting the original back.  But the replacement model "froze up" after just 4 days and this time I am getting a refund.  To quote an e-mail from Amazon regarding this product "As it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread than  --- we originally thought, we are not able to send another replacement."  So, DO NOT order one!
Many thanks to the earlier reviewers who recommended the Amigo.  We bought both the guitar and case for our 5-year-old daughter to take to weekly lessons and we couldn't be happier.  The materials, workmanship and finish are remarkable for the price.  And more importantly, it plays like a real guitar.  The sound is sweet and round enough that I genuinely enjoy the sound of 5-year-old practicing (!), and after an initial breaking-in period it holds tuning well
After years of e-filing fees being included with the purchase price, it would have been more forthcoming for TurboTax to put a large sticker on the front of their box alerting buyers to the price that they will pay for e-filing each return. ---  --- I lost the value of my entire state return - and then some - through e-filing fees: $44.95 (plus tax) for the program, $16.95 (plus tax) for each return e-filed (I filed two) and a little bonus fee to the company that handles the [credit card] transaction (that fee is never quoted in the program and I will have to wait for my credit card statement to find out what that is).  In addition, anyone who chooses to have the fees deducted from his/her refund has to pay an additional $30. ---  --- The product does what it says.  But, for the cost, and less-than-honest way in which the change occured (it almost seemed deceitful - hence the single star rating), I would have preferred to have given my money to my friendly neighborhood accountant. ---  --- People expect change, even if they don't like it.  But, suprises that cost customers money are never welcome and drive customers away.  Surely the marketing/advertising gurus can think of a way to alert the customer of a significant change such as this and even put a "positive" spin on it.  "Filing fees only $16.95 [per return] - less than the cost of a tax professional . . ." ---  --- No more TurboTax for me
First I rated it great and it was, for two movies. Then it broke and the picture was scrambled and rolling. The end.
I purchased this rack a few months ago and it is very neat. Problem is that it does tend to move when you put the MTX bag on. The movement becomes more of a problem as the weight of the bag increases. Another problem was getting enough clearance between the rack and the tire if you are short like me and don't have the seat raised up really far. If you play around enough you can get it to work, but if you decide to put on the Topek rear fender (which I did)you may have to adjust your seat a little higher than might be comfortable. I just got accustomed to having the seat a little higher. Bottom line is that Topek has made a very neat system that just needs a few more refinements (and some better instructions) to make it perfect. 
right the people i work with love this band and album so really i was pressured into buying this album..so i bought and i thought i was going to be blown away due to the hype from my friends but in reality this sucks more than the mudvayne album i've just reviewed terrible distorted guitars bad production off key singing, half baked lyrics the only good thing is the cover and maybe one of the singles are vaguely average apart from that the rest sucks...don't be fooled by the hype by the press this band sucks so will babyshamble
I have had this camera for about a year.  It has been nothing but a problem.  First, the kodak easyshare software has continuous problems.  I have spent HOURS trying to fix it.  Still has bugs in it no matter what I do.  ---  --- Secondly, the camera is very unreliable.  I have a wedding to go to this weekend and I do not trust it and am taking a disposable camera too.  How do I explain the problems I have had?  There are so many.  The camera misfunctions continuously.  Sometimes it does nothing at all.  Other times the zoom lense will not shut.  You turn the option selector on and even though it is on the option you select you get another option.  I sometimes can not even shut the camera off I gotta take the batteries out to do so...if I can even find batteries that work in the camera. ---  --- Honestly, I call tech supoport and told them the problems I have having and they tell me that only Kodak batteries work with the camera and told me to buy some.  SO I went to a nice camera shop and they do not sell kodak batteries.  The camera salesman told me that Kodak cameras are junk and the brand of battery should not matter.  I believe him.  So my camera which would not work...I asked the salesman to help me out.  It did not work with any lithium batteries.....reusable or rechargable. He popped in some alkaline batteries and amazingly it worked.  Well, everyone knows alkaline batteries have a real short short life.  My camera now does not work with either batteries.  Probably only Kodak batteries....maybe....or maybe Kodak wants to get another ten bucks out of me. ---  --- I personally don't even think the pictures this camera takes are any good.  Really, when people take pictures of me with this camera my eyes are always closed.  I am so anxious to get rid of this camera.....well would be but know I gotta fork over at least $250 on a good camera.  Trying to save money on this 'disposable' camera was a waste.  STAY AWAY FROM KODAK CAMERAS!  If you don't believe me get a creditable camera magazine and read reviews. --- 
If you haven't read this book, I would make it TOP PRORITY! This book is fantastic! There hasnt been anything close to it yet. She is an outstanding writer and produces wonderful stories! Better grab a tissue, its a tear-jerker
I recently started Weight Watchers and was looking to purchase a new and accurate scale.  I figured I would buy a WW product, but after reading the reviews, I decided to go with the Omron scale.  I am very pleased with this product.  It has been extremely accurate.  It keeps a history for both my husband and I.  I would highly recommend this scale to anyone!  It is also an attractive scale which is a bonus.  Go with the Omron scale
I've never been quite a fan of music DVDs.  By that I mean the live stuff.  I much rather be there to experience it then sit at home pretending I'm there.  That's one side of it.  I'm also a huuuuuge Gorillaz fan.  And I have seen them live.  The show to their self titled debut. But don't get me wrong, that doesn't make me biased towards everything they put out.  On the contrary it leaves me to judge them on a higher level because I only expect the best from what they've given. ---  --- With that said, this has to be literally one of the best music DVDs I have encountered in quite some time.  Don't worry about extras, documentaries, which while would have been nice to show how it was put together, are not here.  Which makes sense since the band itself is very discreet they wouldn't show you all that. ---  --- The show itself was amazing, and it literally jumps off screen as you watch this, and I recommend you have a decent audio system as well.  The amazing sound quality coupled by the beautiful visuals is astonishingly done well.  The editing and the post production were so well conceived they worked on this like a labour of love and not just another DVD to sell.  From start to end it will leave you speechless.  As you stare in awe at the grandioso that is the Gorillaz, you realise that while at first you figured them to be a fictious band in every aspect, they are quite real and very capable of producing grand music on every level.  You can tell by this by the standing ovation and after the show and after the encore.  Only few bands have ever been able to touch me musically on such a deep level. And to put on such a show which normally you could only catch at the studio over a period of months to produce is a feat in itself. ---  --- If you want special features videos and documentaries get the 2 other DVDs especially now since they just released their newest one.  Those will fill in all that nicely.  But even if you're not a fan or just a new convert, I highly recommend you own this.  No matter the age, or person you are, (you notice this on the DVD as well) and regardless of what your favourite genre is.  Because they are so massive they can't be contained into one. ---  --- Thank you Damon and Jamie for such an experience, mates
The first watch I received did not work at all; the second watch runs fast, I really thought Seiko made a better product. Maybe it really isn't a Seiko
Epson's ink is great but very expensive! I use a continuous flow system for my printer from MIS.  Just Google "MIS" . (Midwest Ink Supply)
Cannot order these as they do not say what small, medium or large=....I have a 6 year olde and is 60#'s so do I buy a medium or a large...I hate this when I want  something and there is not enough information..
I use a plastic water bottle and the only part that is kept cold is the bottom. 
I have been studing leadership for over 15 years both by reading and experience.  I consider this book to be the best book I have read because it describes leadership as a learned activity.  It also says that leadership is in motivating people to do their own work in solving difficult problems. I found that as President of my congregation I was continually going back to the concepts in the book to lead it through a very difficult situation involving placement of the flags in the sanctuary.  It was very difficult to get people to do their own work and not try to step in to solve everything. (That would have been impossible anyway) I found that he described President Lyndon Johnson as a successful leader (civil rights) and unsuccessful leader ( Vietnam).  His discussion on leading without authority is new ground for me.    If you want to discuss the book with others there is an on-line book study at the Work and Worship Institute website. I found it was a good way for me to get more from the book. This is a great book with great stories of a variety of leaders in our society. 
This is absolutely adorable.  Not only is it a great jack in the box for a boy or a girl but you can also play peek a boo with the monkey.  My daughter is 20 months old and she loves it!!!
First of all,I recieved the item in a very timely fashion..Approx 3 days..Second the packaging was very nice..The chain was a good quality snake chain and the pendent was a very good quality..Heavy and prettier in person
Bought this as a girft for my mother, and she loves reading them. Must be really good
I was looking forward to getting this toy for my son. But when I opened it up I was disappointed to see that there were only three tools inside the bag. I thought the picture showed several more tools. Maybe my tool kit was not complete. Either way my son never really showed much interest in it
I ordered a Motorola RAZR V3 Mauve Phone (Unlocked)a month ago. I was hoping to get the color that I saw on the web page...and that's where the problem lies.  ---  --- The image shown is completely misleading.The phone that I received, was mauve but a different one from the picture shown on the Amazon web site. --- The mauve phone that I got was a grayish dull mauve and not the pretty pinkish mauve as advertised. Also,the phone had 2 different color tones. At night/in the lighting at night, the top part of the phone(the part that flips open) and its corresponding part at the back of the phone looks completely gray. ---  --- Needless to say, I spoke to customer service and sent the phone back for an exchange.I didn't have to pay the shipping charges.  ---  --- The 2nd phone that came had the same color problem again, so for the 2nd time I returned it and got my money refunded. ---  --- I gave 1 star due to the customer service provided, but again they could not help me. Some one said it could be an item with a defect....but for me --- the whole experience was  disappointing. ---  --- If you are ready to spend so much on this phone its because of the brand, and the 'color' which you will never get because Amazon has put the wrong image on the web page...very misleading and wrong to all the customers. ---  --- Incidentally, this color as seen is offered by Verizon and they call it 'pink', but Amazon calls it 'mauve',though the phone and the image shown do not match.  --- So stay away from ordering this pretty mauve phone...all you will get is loads of disappointment with your time being wasted. ---  --- 
Everyone should own this product. I receieved my item on the day I was told it would arrive, and it looked exactly like the picture
This is a nice bag, but don't buy it for a Canon S2 IS it will not fit.  The product compatibility lists the S1 IS since the S2 and S1 are very similar I purchased this bag.  I can't even get the thing in the bag.  It is a nice bag however and have put my smaller Kodak camera in it.  There is plenty of room for a typical point and shoot camera and all of it's accessories.  Good quality
Over time (9 months) my aquasana filter developed cracks in both the shower head and filter housing. Customer service told me to buy a new one. I guess it really is 'All about the money'. Pass this loser. Buy a metal body filter
I just bought these to compare to my pair of V20s, and they just suck in comparison. ---  --- The Bass is non existent in comparison, and the highs and mids sound absolutely tinny. Any sort of Equilizer work resulted in immediate distortion.  ---  --- I'm usually a fan of Altec Lansing products, but... --- These look nice and are compact, but the sound is not good, at all. The fact that they are more expensive than the competition is just appalling...
Outstanding camera in every respect. I've owned several digital cameras in recent years (Sony & Nikon). The N2's giant 3" LCD, the touch screen features, lens optics, and overall ease of use top any of my previous cameras. I use it for both land and underwater photography and it performs flawlessly. Good job Sony
This stopwatch has an amazing array of functions but is difficult to use; sometimes it behaves erratically and starts timing up instead of counting down, or starts all over again when the countdown is only half done. Don't know if it's really misbehaving or it's just on some obscure other function when I think I set it for countdown...? Operating manual is available online pdf, and it's several pages long
Both adults and kids alike very much enjoyed this popcorn. Nice cheddar flavor without any yellow hands
I have 20 mo. old twin boys. I was given 2 different tricycles and each of my boys only wanted to ride the Disney McQueen trike so I had to purchace another one. This trike has two different sitting positions, has a wide wheel base for stability, and sits lower to the ground. My boys still can't use the pedels but love to use the trike as a ride on toy - It's a great trike for younger toddlers who want to ride early!
This is a great gate if you have a strong, healthy back and always have two hands available.  But how many people with kids have both of those!  It was great at keeping my baby in the room, but my 4 year old couldn't open it and neither could her grandma.  And it made me and my husband want to cuss.  It is back in the box and in the return pile.  Don't waste your money.
Star Wars: Jedi Knight II - Jedi Outcast. The third game in the Star Wars Dark Forces series.  ---  --- INTRODUCTION:  --- I've pretty much always been a fan of Star Wars, and as you may have guessed, I'm a fan of many of the games based on the series. Although Star Wars games are often hit and miss, when one succeeds, it usually succeeds beautifully. One of the most interesting ideas for a Star Wars game was Dark Forces, released for the Playstation One and the PC. Although the game itself was horrendous, with a terribly-choppy framerate and very poor level design, it was something the world had never seen before - a Star Wars first-person shooter. The sequel, Jedi Knight, cleaned up a lot of the problems, and added in some new innovations. And now the third game in the series, Jedi Outcast, has arrived. Like previous games in this sub-series, it has gotten a multi-console release. Read on to see how it fares!  ---  --- OVERVIEW:  --- Jedi Outcast is a Star Wars first-person shooter. The game has a one-player quest, as well as several different multiplayer modes.  ---  --- REVIEW:  --- To put it simply, this game is everything the original Dark Forces should have been. While not perfect, this game is a huge improvement over its predecessors. Once again you play the role of Kyle Katarn, the agent from the other Dark Forces titles. The second Death Star has been destroyed, but many Imperial forces still fight on, so it's up to you to infiltrate their hideouts and exterminate them. The graphics are, for the most part, solid. I was impressed at how good they are for this kind of game. Nothing state-of-the-art, but they're still pretty damn good. Control has also been given an overhaul and rightfully so, since this game lets you use force powers and wield a lightsaber. The single-player mode is extremely entertaining, and the fact that the game offers multiplayer options only adds to the overall value of the package. And you can save whenever you want to in the single-player mode! But, of course, the game isn't perfect. Like earlier Dark Forces games, the level design just is not that good. Too many areas look alike, and there are too many instant death spots that are just too easy to fall into. Likewise, in many cases your objectives are unclear, and some of the puzzles are a pain - I don't know about you, but I buy first-person shooters to shoot people, not solve puzzles! Because of the imbalanced puzzles and often poor level design, it took me over an hour just to beat the first level! Another huge problem is availability. Lack of custom control configuration also plagues the game. This is a huge problem, since the game's limited control selections will often clash with what you're used to for this sort of game. This game wasn't released on the Gamecube in very high quanitites, so you're gonna have to shell out the full new price just to get a USED copy - and in my mind, it's NOT worth that price. Sad but true. I do recommend this game to Star Wars fans, just be warned that it's not perfect, and it's hard to get a copy.  ---  --- EDITION NOTES:  --- This is a good game, but for some strange reason it just wasn't available on the Gamecube for very long. Because of this, even USED copies fetch close to the original new retail price. This is extremely annoying for people like me who want to get every Star Wars game. Still, you should hunt it down if you're into this sort of thing.  ---  --- OVERALL:  --- Overall this is the best game in the Dark Forces sub-series thusfar. Where the game succeeds, it succeeds beautifully. I am impressed with the game, it's just a shame the Gamecube version was not made readily available to all would-be players. I strongly recommend this game if you can get a hold of it - I doubt it will disappoint any Star Wars fan. 
Absolute gems.  Simple, versatile shoes that are fun, comfortable, and have great casual style.  I have them in red, wear them to work, when traveling, and the one time I got stuck in a surprise Seattle snowstorm, they even had traction.  Nearly an all-purpose shoe.
We have a new Keurig coffee maker and just love Timothy's coffees, any flavor, but especially the German Chocolate.  Great price too
works great there are a set of lg head phones that seperate and can be used to adapt your lg phone to what ever you wan
There's a fine line between tacky and hip, and these slippers are not it.  These slippers looked much cuter in the picture than they do in person.  Also, the only thing between your foot and the floor is a thin piece of rubber-y fabric.  They're not made for warmth.  All around disappointing
I bought this part and the addition that makes it a double shelf. I have my TV on it and it's great
I WATCHED THIS FILM BACK IN THE 80'S WHEN IT WAS FIRST RELEASED --- AND I LOVED IT.A REAL TEAR JERKER WITH A TINGE OF HUMOUR THROWN --- IN.A DEFINATE LADIES FILM I WOULD SAY AS A LOT OF BLOKES DON'T LIKE ALL THAT MUSHY STUFF.GOOD ACTING ALL AROUND FROM KEVIN BACON AND AN APPEARANCE BY A THEN DASHING ALEC BALDWIN --- LADIE'S FETCH THE HANKIES
Plugged the unit in a few weeks after I purchased it.  I was heading down to VA. for a reunuion (8 hr. trip).  Set it up facing "backwards" so the kids could make use of the cup holders from the middle seats of the minivan.  The unit cooled quickly and kept the sodas, cheese and veggies cool throughout.  The unit is quiet, didn't really know it was running unless I had the engine off.  Could be a little roomier but you can only do so much with the space between the front seats.  Overall got what I paid for and the unit worked as advertised
Jmaes Joyce takes us on Stephen Daedalus' interior journey from pre-teen as son of a country gentleman to young adult who wanders the streets of Dublin, struggling with sin, salvation, intellect, ambivalence about his homeland, and his father's decline.  It is not a linear path, but then whose is?  The story is not so much about the artist as a young man, but about a young man's journey to artistic sensibility, its pretensions and exhilirations.  ---  --- Jaklak sez check it out
This is a good compact flash card.  This is faster than most cameras can handle so there was no real reason to go with faster cards that are much more expensive. 
We bought one of these in the spring of '05. We took it on vacation in July of '05 and the LCD screen blacked out a few days into our vacation. I called HP and was informed that a RECONDITIONED (used) camera was all that I could get. The camera was still under the manufacturers' warranty, but their policy was to replace it with a used camera, not a new one. I had to settle for the "reconditioned" camera.  It has been OK since then.  ---  HP's customer service is at best mediocre. There are the usual annoying and seemingly endless voice prompts in order to get to an actual service rep, and since HP has out-sourced all of its tech support to the third world, I had a hard time understanding the reps I spoke to. ---  This camera also eats a ton of batteries and takes a few seconds to engage after depressing the button, which is annoying if you're trying to photograph anything other than a posed shot. ---  All in all, disappointing. I will never buy another HP camera
I would recommend this product over to others.  No complaints
I purchased six of these chairs in August for myself and my friends before the start of the college football season for tailgaiting.  They were all made by this manufacturer (North Pole) and had different NFL logos on them (I only bought one through Amazon, the others were bought through different companies due to availability issues). ---  --- At the first game of the season, my chair (Steelers) broke.  At the second game of the season, two more chairs (Bengals and Broncos) broke.  They were not misused and no weight limits were exceeded.  They all broke in the same exact place; the plastic pieces at the base of the legs all cracked.  Therefore, 3 out of 6 broke within probably less than 3-5 hours. ---  --- Needless to say, at $25-$30 each I would recommend prospective buyers to spend their money elsewhere
I'm on my 3rd v-180 in less than a year and every one of them has had a fatal flaw that caused me to return it (under warranty) for another.  Unfortunately, they have the option of sending you a refurbished model, which means that they tried to fix someone else's problem phone and pawn it off on you. This one is going to get flushed as soon as I find another phone to buy, since Cingular says it's now out of warranty and I'm not eligible for an upgrade for another 6 months
It embarrases me that I, a music man, have let this many years go by without reviewing this splendid movie. My wife rented it from a Hasting's video store back when DVDs were not widely distributed. I was in awe of the movie as it ended because I had no clue what to expect, and I wasn't expecting much anyway. ---  --- Richard Dreyfuss plays the role of Glenn Holland, a recent college graduate who takes the job of a music teacher to provide an income (he calls it a 'fall back position') while he writes what he hopes will be a musical masterpiece that will make him rich and famous. His first semester is a trying and learning experience as students see him as that school teacher everybody hated and whose class everyone dreaded. ---  --- But he finds his way into the students' hearts. The movie begins in the early 1960s, and rock 'n' roll has etched a permanent mark on the music landscape. Most of the students, of course, love the new music. Realizing he has an 'in' with the students, he makes an accurate comparison by playing Bach's "Minuet in G" (for Anna Magdalena) and asking the students what song it is. They reply it is the "Lovers Concerto" by the Toys ("What color is the rain that falls softly on my window.."). He notes they are wrong and that it is actually the SAME song (although he doesn't note that Bach's is in 3/4 and the Toys in 4/4) and is an example of an ancient music scale called the Dorian scale. He now has them right where he wants them. ---  --- Along the way, he continues to work on his masterpiece. But life, a new baby who turns out to be deaf, and the need for new things put his life on hold. As he notes by quoting John Lennon, "Life is what happens while you're making other plans" (or some facsimile thereof). Years continue to go by and events occur that happen in the life of virtually ever music teacher. ---  --- He has that one student who has a lot of heart but not a lot of ability - yet needs to get an hour of credit so he can remain eligible to play football. He has another student who wants to play the clarinet but is nervous. Yet he always comes back to the simple rock 'n' roll to make his point about 'real' music. ---  --- But reality plays hide and seek sometimes. He has it out with his wife about their deaf son - and his frustrations come to a boiling point on the night John Lennon is killed. Over time, they become friends - and one of the sweet sights of the movie is the son feeling the vibrations from the speaker as he 'hears' the music. ---  --- But another reality awaits - education budget cuts, and here Dreyfuss delivers the line with outstanding effect: "The day they cut the football budget in this state...well, that will certainly be the end of western civilization as we know it." It is in the presence of his now good friend, Jay Thomas (the football coach), that he talks about how he never wanted to teach but now that is all he wants to do. ---  --- The music track in this movie is awesome. There's just one thing I'm still trying to figure out: how did the students manage to mass distribute his music and practice it without him knowing it? --- 
I bought the converter since I wanted to use it for landscape photography.  I took some test shots and discovered that the converter has an unacceptable amount of barrel distorion.  If you are thinking about buying this product just be aware that you will have to correct your images through software after you take them
This product was delivered fast.......It was so easy to install.......and the light is a pretty blue just like the picture. --- When the light is on it does not show up as well
Despite the chintzy, unconvincing facial hair (Jeff Daniels' being the exception); Martin Sheen's too-gentlemanly interpretation of Gen. Lee's accent (and his beard); obvious & saccharine soliloquies about the higher purpose for fighting the war; generalized (and largely inaccurate) interpretations of the underlying history of the war; and hopelessly, ridiculously, wildly off-the-mark attempts atNew England accents, the film still works. ---  --- I understand that to get a film produced and distributed, it is often necessary to have recognizable names in the cast.  But an unknown who looks more like General Lee than Martin Sheen would have been a better choice.  And C. Thomas Howell's performance--well, let's just say that his glued-on beard was more convincing than his acting.  Jeff Daniels, however, does an excellent job, in large part because he doesn't try to convince you he's from New England and consequently does not come off like Cliff from Cheers, using every stereotype associated with nasal 'r'-dropping.  Instead of focusing on the so-called nasality of  the NE accent (think of Sheen in The Missiles of Octobah), Daniels allows the viewer to suspend disbelief.  But then, here comes CT Howell again to slap you across the face and remind you that Sheen and Kevin Costner aren't the only actors who should have appeared as New Englanders in an Ed Wood production. ---  --- I think the story works because there's enough commitment to historical military fact to make it believable.  The battle scenes probably should have been more visually graphic to evoke the horror of the battle, but the movie makers either didn't have the budget for gore (maybe it was spent on the obviously fake beards) or decided to err on the side of forbearance.  If Gettysburg had been made 8-10 years later, it might have benefited from the newer style of violence-depiction, as in Saving Private Ryan, Thin Red Line, or Gladiator.  It falls a bit short of that, however. ---  --- Finally, it should be noted that the producers/director seem to be operating on a rather simplistic view of the war's historical underpinnings, opting to represent the northern point of view as one united behind the idea of freeing the slaves. Anyone who knows about the Boston busing riots of the 1970s will understand that not all of the north is steeped in racial generosity and brotherhood. Very few who fought on the side of the blue fought because they believed in the abolition of slavery.  They fought to preserve the Union, which is a very different concept.  Abolition of slavery happened to be the issue that forced the South's hand, but it was not the sole cause of the war.  The movie dumbs this down a bit, making the message more like what you'd find in a 5th-grade text book. ---  --- The battle at Gettysburg was certainly pivotal, but viewers should remember that it did not end the Civil War.  The north absolutely needed to win it, but Lee continued to cause the North fits for almost 2 years after Gettysburg.  C. Thomas Howell will continue to cause me fits every time I think of this movie. ---  --- Still and all, the film is very watchable.  And due credit should be given to the re-enactors, arguably the greatest source of credibility for the film
...and three years later I buy the game. --- Wow! Awesome! I can't believe it runs so well after the three years of its release! Everything looks and feels great on my XP. This is one of the only games I have purchased and and not had to return due to the CD being messed up or some corrupted file. So... I'm happy! ---  --- I thought no one would play the multi player anymore but there seem to always be games going on. Yep, this is a game I would suggest to any gamer
I cringe at the idea that I fed my baby from heated up polycarbonate bottles. I might not be able to breastfeed my baby, but with my new glass bottles, at least I know that I am feeding her the purest form of formula I can possibly give. She hated the taste of the latex rubber nipples so I bought some silicone ones and was successful. --- When I consider the epidemic of autism in this country, I am dedicated to buying pure, organic baby products and avoiding using plastic products especially when heating in the microwave. 
When I received the item the box was busted open and all the cookies in both packages were crushed up.  One of the packages was open and leaking cookies dust all over my car when I pulled it out of the mailing box.  On top of that the one or two cookies that were salvaged were stale!  Ill never order anything from this company again!!!  My entire $11.00 went down the tubes.  What a waste!!!
I just received my first order, and I love it!  This magazine covers a broad range of topics and includes designer techniques, current trends, period styles and so much more.  It has tons of vibrant pictures to illustrate the articles.  I think this magazine would be ideal for someone just starting out in design to gain a basic understanding on a wide range of topics, and also for the experienced designer to keep up with current trends and fill in the gaps with knowledgeable tidbits
I watched this movie last evening and I have to say that I have never seen weird, confusing movie since 12 Monkies.  I'm still confused.  --- The plot is pathetic and mindlessly confusing, it's all about lucid dreams and Tom Cruise seeing how many times he can flick his hair in a minute while the cameras on him.  The film is basically all a blur from start to finish, it's a dreadful mix of sci-fi nonsense and obvious fake romance.  Why on earth would someone want to remake a foreign film with this kind of plot anyway.  Don't buy this film on DVD or you'll be wasting your money.  I'm sorry if you've found this review uninformative, but since Vanilla Sky is really about nothing whatsoever it's very hard to go into much detail.
I've used GS27 on two cars of mine that had scratches. I've noticed it will permanently remove or greatly improve nearly all minor to medium scratches. It really depends on the scratch and how deep it is. It works like MAGIC on some scratches and dramatically improves most other mild to medium grade scratches. It works alot like a car wax as far as application/removal. You have to buff it off with a cloth and it will have a brilliant shine. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is it doesn't completly remove all scratches.
This has been my everyday scent for the last six years. The predominent note is a sparkling anise, an anise that affects a cold, even metallic, chemic artifice. Swirling about this shivery base note are hints of moss, violet, and vanilla-like tonka, lending an aura of both forest and fantasy.  ---  --- Though this is a relatively popular scent, Lolita eschews convention. There are no white flowers, no rose, no peach, none of the banal and cloying sweetness that plagues so many scents. This perfume is instead sensual yet apart, not at all come-hither but insinuating and dark as a Grimm's tale. The tonka is sweet and powdery, gently seductive, while the more prominent anise intoxicates. ---  --- The bottle is stunning; I never throw out a spent one.  --- 
With its cheap pricetag and thick size, Fantasy & Science Fiction is definately one of the best. It splits it pages into fantasy & science fiction stories and novellas with a few common columns between (book reviews and strange facts). If you write fantasy or science fiction, pick magazine up
I use this with a PC running on Windows XP Home Edition SP2 and it works marvels. Damn, I didn't even need to install the drivers that came with it. I just grabbed the USB cable, plugged it in and started making sequences on Sonar 4. ---  --- No latency, nothing. ---  --- I recommend this product for both PC and Mac users
...and bike was stolen less than one month after delivery. I have HALF the cable now. ---  --- Good price and attractive product for a LOW security environment
I lived through the vietnam era.  IF you did you can't ever forget.  This guy was right in the middle of the crucial decisions that brought the debacle down on us.  Here he sifts through the sands of his memory and tries to synthesize how it went wrong, why it went wrong and what we can learn to KEEP FROM REPEATING IT.   ---  --- For me, here was the most unforgettable moment.  Decades later he returns to vietnam and winds up sitting at a formal dinner next to his north vietnamese counterpart from those days.  Macnamara tells him we--the americans--were not a colonial power seeking to impose our will but were fighting to stop the spread of communism, seeing north vietnam as a tentacle of communist china.  The north vietnamese official gaped at him and then began pounding the table and said, "Mr. Macnamara, you must have never read a history book!  We've been FIGHTING the chinese for a thousand years!  We aren't their puppet!  We were fighting for our national freedom!  We would have fought to the last man!"  Macnamara says they almost came to blows. ---  --- Here's the point.  Macnamara says, as compared to say the soviets, we didn't understand the north vietnamese.  We didn't really know enought about them.  We had no idea what was in their minds.  And that was why we wound up fighting the wrong war against the wrong country and for the wrong reasons!  That's why we lost! ---  --- Does any of this sound familiar??????   ---  --- This is a fantastically good piece of work that ought to be required viewing for every american of voting age.  It's that good and that informative.  Of course, it won't be widely viewed by the american public.  We'll go our goofy way coveting our big-screen tvs and gas guzzling cars and spending our time on important things--like sporting events
This is absolutely the worse digital device I have ever owned.  The manual is worthless and the web site even worse.  I try to delete the included photos, and nothing happens.  I can't download photos from my Mac.  If your digital memory card has many photos, good luck trying to find the ones you want to download to the frame.
This movie creeped me out and not in a good way. Johnny Depp is an awesome actor and I usually find him sexy but in THIS stinker I find him really creepy and gross. Maybe it's the Michael Jackson-ish look he has going on with the black wig and white face. Could they have picked a more horrible look for WW? It looked like they took him to a costume store and put a 10$ wig and 5$ clown makup on him! I love Tim Burton's other movies but this one sucked BIGTIME! It gives a new perspective on Willy Wonka but this Willy is someone I would keep kids AWAY from. This movie is childish if you're an adult and pales compared to the original. If you're a kid it's way too dark and scary and has some adult humor which will leave kids asking "Auntie Zoe, what does that mean?" When are screenwriters going to figure it out? EITHER WRITE A KIDS MOVIE OR WRITE A GROWNUP MOVIE!!! It's really hard to do both in the same film. It seems like when writers try to make movies that appeal to adults and kids, they end up appealing to nobody! Maybe I am biased because I loved the original Gene Wilder version. I would have been open to seeing a remake if it was GOOD but this movie was dissapointing. It's amazing how so much money and effort go into special effects and expensive sets and the script itself is hollow with lousy characters. The whole thing just had a creepy vibe with almost sadistic undertones. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I love Depp and Burton, if you are not a fan of either, don't waste your time with this steaming pile of poo!
The jacket we received had weird arms, they had a hole for the thumb, and then another for the rest of the fingers. Great for skiing or snowboarding, but for casual use in Florida winter wasn't very practical. Columbia in general is a company I swear by
GREAT!!! It is the Perfect place to store all those wooden puzzles we all have for our toddlers! The puzzles slide right in on the small metal rods...Very easy to remove puzzles! I also like the fact that is made of a lovely natural wood! We have this in our living room, and it is quite attractive
My husband has become an avid watch collector so I gave him this box for Christmas. The design of the box is as attractive as its contents. My husband says that it is easy to use too. From the looks of things I will have to get another box for his ever increasing collection
Valkyrie Profile is a cult classic.  No matter how you look at it.  It was one of those games you either loved or hated.  Obviously enough people loved it enough for Square-Enix to re-release the original on the PSP and make a second one on the Playstation 2.  The end result is a great game that should satisfy fans of the original.  ---  --- Despite what it looks like, Valkyrie Profile 2: Silmeria is not a sequel to Valkyrie Profile but a prequel.  This means if you've never played the first one, fear not, you aren't missing anything.   ---  --- The story centers on Silmeria.  She's a Valkyrie trapped in the body of Princess Alicia.  Because of this it seems like Alicia has a split personality, and that she's got to be crazy or something.  As a result, Alice doesn't have very many friends... if any at all.  Silmeria, has been exiled by Odin, the leader of the Gods.  She now wants revenge for what he has done to her, and since Alice has no friends, she agrees to help.  It's an interesting story, but much like the first one, gets off to a really slow start and takes a while to pick up.   ---  --- The game's story is told through beautiful cinematics  Not quite the best looking game on the PS2, but beautiful enough.  The backgrounds, characters and monsters are all detailed.  Especially in some of the games cutscenes.  The voice acting is also suitable enough for the game.  The game also sounds really good.   ---  --- The good news about Valkyrie Profile 2 is that there is no time limit.  Fans of the first will remember that there was a time limit before the battle at the end of the game.  Valkyrie Profile 2 does away with that and thank goodness it does.  This gives you far more time to explore and do everything the game has to offer, and the dungeons are quite interesting.  ---  --- Most Dungeons are pretty simple.  It sort of plays out in an action/adventure style.  You have photons you can fire at your enemies and certain objects.  Your photon also reflects off some objects, and it's actually vital to use this in some dungeons.  So the photon isn't just there, it's essential.  Even more interesting in Valkyrie Profile is the battle system.  ---  --- Battles are contact based.  In battle you've got your characters on one side and your enemies on the other.  At first it seems like battles take place in real time, but in reality, the enemy only moves when you move.  This gives you more than enough time to plan out a strategy.  Each enemy has an attack zone.  If you're in it, you'll be attacked.  In most RPGs getting attacked is no big deal.  In Valkyrie Profile 2 it's much more than just a big deal.  The difficulty of this game escalates really fast. You'll quickly find yourself overwhelmed by some of your enemies.  Luckily there is a solution.  Most battles have a leader.  If you defeat the leader you win automatically without having to worry about defeating the others.  It helps if you want to end the battle quickly, and especially helps when your party is being decimated.  Still, the battle system calls for complete strategy on your part.   ---  --- They say it takes about 40 hours to complete Valkyrie Profile 2.  However, you'll find yourself spending most of these hours leveling up to take on new challenges.  As I mentioned, the difficulty level rises fast.  Meaning you'll probably do a lot of battling in a dungeon before moving on to the next.  Even worse, you'll have to backtrack out of a dungeon once you complete it.  Even worse than that, enemies respawn when you reenter a room.  The good thing about this at least, is that the dungeons aren't overly long.  Again, however, you'll spend quite some time leveling up.  ---  --- In addition to inside battle, outside battle is just as interesting in dungeons.  You'll often come across sealstones.  When you pick them up they grant enhancements to your party.  They can be either positive or negative.  For example your strength could go up by grabbing one... and go down by grabbing another.  Carrying it puts the effect on your party.  However, you can also put the effect on your enemies by setting the stone on a dais.  Needless to say, you'll want to put the negative effects on your enemies... unless you're looking for a harder challenge than the game already is.  ---  --- Outside of dungeons and battles you can learn plenty of skills throughout the game.  When you buy equipment, you can link it together to give your characters special skills.  This is a lot of fun to play around with.  Although, it should be said, it gets tedious to set it up after a while.  The game shows you which skills you've created through your equipment, but there's no way for it to auto-equip with the stuff that gives you that skill.  At first this is no problem, but then as your characters start to build up and your list gets longer, it becomes a pain to set up all these skills again.  It comes down to way too much time in the menu when there shouldn't have to be.  ---  --- Valkyrie Profile 2 is overall a pretty satisfying game.  If you can get past the sluggish story (which really does turn out to be really good in the end) then you'll find yourself in love with this game.  It's different from the first one, but not so much that old fans will find themselves disappointed.  Actually it's quite the opposite.  If you liked the first game, then by all means, pick up this one.  ---  --- The Good ---  --- +An interesting story --- +Beautiful graphics --- +Excellent music score --- +Good voice acting --- +Large cast of playable characters --- +Interesting skill system --- +Just all out fun to play ---  --- The Bad ---  --- -The story is slow --- -Really steep difficulty level, a lot of the game will no doubt come from you spending time leveling up in dungeons before moving on --- -The skill system is interesting, but not being able to have your equipment auto-equip is really annoying when you've got a lot of characters and a lot of items in your inventory--equipping your characters shouldn't be a tedious chor
So here's the deal, I'm from Omaha, you can't go two miles without an Omaha Steaks Store.  Here we just call em steaks.  I can go to any butcher shop in Omaha and buy steaks that are just as good if not better than anything Omaha Steaks has to offer for considerably less.  This has always been my stance.  That is until I had these, these are quite simply the best steaks.  Yes, they're expensive, but if you're like my family and go out for steaks on birthday's you can actually save quite a bit by buying these instead.  You won't get a better steak in a restaurant, and my uncle's the head chef in a steak house, I could be stabbed just for saying that.  Cooked rare to medium rare you can literally cut them with your fork, they are more tender and have twice the flavor of any filet I've ever had.  I can't stress to you how good these are.  It's still the only steak I buy from Omaha Steaks, but when you come from the land of steaks that's saying a lot.  Sorry Texas, you may have more cows, but Nebraska Beef is simply better
This really works & is very sturdy.  The problem is the bolts they give is too heavy for light home projectors.  Just get 14inch screws from Lowes & you will be OK. ---  --- The manual is not good
I've used all types of film thoughout my photography days and by far Kodaks treated me the best. If your out to capture rich, vibrant colors this is the film for you. So far I've shot 4 rolls of it and I'm amazed at how much the colors stand out. Its definatly the film I'll be using
I ordered the Schwinn 203 just a week ago. It was eligible for free delivery and I took advantage of that offer. It stated that it would take extra time for delivery, however it arrived within a week. Though several have stated it was difficult to put together and took several hours my highly non-mechanical wife and I had it together in about an hour and fifteen minutes. The directions are a bit tricky but knowing that in advance from the other reviews helped. Once we were finished assembling it I got on it and started it up and began peddling. I was sure it was not working correctly becuase there was absolutely no sound at all--mechanical or otherwise. I then reached over and increased the resistance and found out it was working correctly. My wife and I both use it and love it. I am 325 pounds and it works great for me and based on several nights of extreme sweating during my workouts I don't expect to be 325 for long. Super bike!! Very pleased...besides this is what my knee surgeon suggested for rehabilitating a knee I torn up last year and it's doing fine
This receiver puts out a lot of power. It also has a bit of weight to it. It comes with a microphone to automatically adjust it for optimal surround sound. The remote take some getting used to but it is great how you can hook up a DVD player, CD player, radio and many other devices. The display is nice. You really have to read the manual before you start plugging away. If you're a surround sound fan on a budget pick this up
It does work very well once you decide on the best ceiling mount location.  I had to remount/move once to get the laser beam to hit the spot on the car dashboard that we wanted it to when the car was at its desired parking position.  The forward/backward adjustment of the laser after mounting the unit is helpful but not being able to adjust the laser side to side after mounting scored it a 4 instead of 5 star rating from me
The Cybershot DSCS40 was bought as a Christmas gift for my daughter in 2005.  A few days after Christmas 2006, the camera ceased functioning.  Because the camera was shipped in November 2005, Sony refused to honor the one year warrantee and the repair price was given as $111.  Needless to say, we will not be purchasing another Sony product in the future
 You are better off with a sponge and a bucket . There ain't a quick fix to washing your car without going to the local car wash
I usually hates granola bars.  They tend to be too sweet and I am not crazy about the texture.  My 3-year-old son's daycare requires all new kids to pack an earthquake emergency kit (yet, we live in California) and one of the required items is 10 granola bars.  I bought this just to prepare the kit, hoping that he would never have to eat them.  Since the product comes with 30 bars, I took some to the office as my emergency stash.  They are actually quite tasty.  My son also likes them as a quick afternoon snack while we are out and about.  Never thought we would actually consume them when I bought this but it looks like we will reorder soon.  And it's organic
This game is simply awesome. I received it for a gift last Christmas and I still love it. The graphics & action are amazing, it's not available on XBOX. If you don't already own this game you simply cannot go wrong w/ this masterpiece. You'll love it. The main character, Kratos, reminds me of Quan chi in Mortal Kombat. Looking forward to God of War 2 
I've owned this model for about seven years and I think I'll buy another to keep on standby in case I break the original (I'm not gentle with my watches while working/playing). ---  --- Tough, pretty easy to set, good features, and classic "diver" style at a great price. What's not to like? Wouldn't mind having a light on the LCD, otherwise it is proven a great investment. ---  --- Battery lasts ~2 years with the alarm going off every day and watch band life is about the same (cracks develop after a while). No corrosion (duh, stainless steel) and good resistance to scratches on the crystal so far.
Spin will do anything to try and stay hip. I wanted to gag when i saw a picture of blink 182 in their "tribute" to kurt cobain mag. Im a huge nirvana fan and the only good thing about those articles were the pictures. they were poorly written and dull. they didnt even scrape the surface of kurt's music, and his impact on an entire generation. i suggest maybe guitar world or anything other then spin..
I have been a user of PaperPort since version 9, skipped the upgrade to 10 because of bad reviews, received an upgrade notice in the mail, so I decided to buy it. It turns out it was a bad decision. The scanner that I use with 11 is the same as with 9 and is on Nuance's hardware compatibility list. The problem is, it took me uninstalling and reinstalling the program to get the scanner to work at all with PaperPort. Then, when I did get it installed - and I used the advanced setup option with it, tested it, all looked good - except everytime I scan something, the program crashes! It is literally unusable as a scanning solution. ---  --- I have seen a few companies with products that were once really good, sell it off to another company, and the product support seems to be essentially abandoned. It seems that this may be the case. There are no updates or bug fixes for 11, and I will not buy another PaperPort version in the future. I will attempt to go back to 9, and probably stay with that. If I run into any issues with it over time, I will look elsewhere, and I recommend others do the same. I normally don't write reviews for products, but this one is so poor, I just had to warn people
I came to this film after rave reviews from friends, so perhaps I was expecting too much. There is much to admire here; the acting is top-notch, the contrast between chatty characters and completely silent people in the opening interview scenes is well-crafted, and the plot premise itself is a fascinating one. For me, films are all about endings, and I felt in this area After Life didn't quite pay off. I didn't really buy into the romance, and wanted to know more backstory about the female character so I could care more whether she gets the guy or not.  I also thought they could have cut it a bit more - it feels 10-15 minutes too long to me. However, these are minor criticisms; it is a film I will watch again, and recommend to Japanese film fans, especially those who like the more slow-paced Japanese films such as Eureka, Moe no Suzaku and Sonatine
I bought this for my father who only has one leg to use in his shower/tub combo.  He loves it.  Esp. the height adjustment feature
Getting the flashlight is a real problem.  After paying for expedited shipping on Dec 1, meaning Dec 8th -- at the latest -- arrival.  Still waiting on the 17th.  Called customer service, who promised to call back in 10 minutes.  Never heard back on status.  Filed a claim for reimbursement on the item
I wanted this Bible for Mother's Day after I did not get it I ordered it on June 25 and got it rather quickly.  Enough said about the wonderful shipping time with Amazon Prime. ---  --- I normally do not like Bibles that do not have the words of Christ in red but this Bible is sensational.  I love it!!!! I like the way it gives an overview of each book of the Bible.  The colorful maps and illustrations make this Bible beautiful.  At the end of the Bible there are 365 memory verses to be learned each day.  So not only is studying emphasized but learning scriptures is also emphasized. ---  --- This Bible is wonderful for individuals who are new to reading the Bible.  I would highly recommend geting this Bible as a gift for a new convert or seasoned veteran in the Gospel who is interested in in depth study.  Reading this Bible is fun. 
This cable is much more expensive when you try to buy it elsewhere.  I received the cable quickly and the company even sent me an email to let me know where to download the appropriate program free from the Samsung website.  Works great
This was a christmas gift, however I can rate it on the base that I own one just like it.  This is good for a lifetime of fun
I have an Acura CL TypeS, and I got this steering control when I got a Pioneer AVIC-D2. The unit wasn't too hard to setup, the manufacturer's website is pretty helpful. I did notice that it sometimes is pretty slow to process my steering wheel button presses. Rarely, it also completely ignores them, I have to let go of the button, pause, and press again. ---  --- Even with these little issues, I still like the unit, mostly because I can use my left hand to control the volume while my right hand is reaching for the phone, or whatever else
This is one program that in my opinion you get more than what you pay for I have several Immaging programs that I use for several different things. This one is a delight to use and does a great job taking most of the work off the user. Its a microsoft program that is very user friendly and easy to use. However you do have to be some what computer savy, (like know where to turn on the computer kind of thing) not like some of the 1 star comments that were made here by other folks. I would recomend it to all people that need a simple to use program. Its not what you pay for something its what you do with it after you get it
I really liked this product.  I am a late 30's woman whose skin is basically pretty good.  I have occasional mild breakouts and some blackheads, but even before I bought the Neutrogena microdermabrasion I would receive compliments on how smooth my skin is. But around age 35 I looked in the mirror and realized my skin was getting that middle-age dullness to it.  Unwilling to pay for a professional microdermabrasion, I decided to try the Neutrogena at home system.   ---  --- The Neutrogena Microdermabrasion cream is easy to apply.  The cream had the slightest pleasant smell, and was not sticky at all.  I used well less than a teaspoon, so a little goes a long way.  It was no problem to rinse it off my face with water, and the sponge was very easy to clean as well.  The treatment took me less than 10 minutes, fit in easily to my bedtime routine, and after the initial start-up treatments you only need to do it a couple times a week. ---  --- My skin definitely felt softer, smoother and more invigorated.  I could notice a difference after only one treatment.  But the real proof came from the way my husband did a double take a couple days later and commented that I looked younger.  (He didn't know about the microdermabrasion.)  And even my 6 year old daughter told me my face looked pretty.  There was a clear and noticeable difference--after only a few treatments my middle-aged dull skin had definitely gotten back some of its youthful glow, and the few large pores I have did appear smaller. ---  --- Being lazy, I have not incorporated it into my regular routine like I should, but I do pull it out a few days before special occasions, vacations, or anytime I feel the need for a little brightening up, and will definitely always keep it on hand. ---  --- If you have particularly sensitive skin, this may not be a great product for you, as it is a bit, well, abrasive.  For me, it was a painless process, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to give their skin a more youthful glow
I'm happy I receive my cable. It fast service. I'll still keep buying from this seller. thank
This jacket is soft and almost luxurious.  I am greatly disappointed that when hanging the hoodie by the hood, it split and tore under its own weight!!!!  I think this says it all, no?  I would, unfortunately, not buy and American Apparel item again.  They are usually sized WAY too small and now I see the quality just isn't there.  Greener pastures.....
I could care less what it does for the original Xbox--what I'm into is the memory card reader that allows you to transfer Xbox save files over to Xbox 360. Now I won't have to start Halo all over
This works great with our Chicco Capri stroller. It took a bit of trial and error to get it in the perfect place so the stroller would close. However, once I figured that out, it was great. I could take the accessories off and just put them on when needed. The swivel is a great concept. I actually wish it came with a third clasp so baby could have a cup holder and snack holder (one on each side) and mommy could have her water bottle clip. We just switch them out for baby or they hold their sippy by the handles.
This holster is by far better than the stock holster that comes with the phone.  ---  --- It has a lower profile which means it sits closer to your belt. ---  --- It is also is much easier to actuate than the stock holster. The thumb tab is oriented in just the right direction for easy in/out. The phone clips in solidly and doesn't fall out
Really it is a good game on war, buy it since it(he) is very goo
This eyeliner really matches the description, it goes on super smooth and doesn't tug or drag.  I was told at the counter that it was "water resistant" but it's really not.  I used to wear it under my lower eyelashes, but by the end of the day, it would be totally smudged and gross.  I would even try to put powder over it, but to no avail.  However, in defense of Laura, I am over 40 and the fine lines below my eyes aren't friendly to many pencil eye liners.  I was just hoping against hope that Laura's would be different!  So, now I only use it over the upper lid
This deal was too good to be true. Of course I wasn't expecting any name brand stuff here, but at least I expected them to all work. I don't know if I got a bad earbud or what, but it adds static and noise and therefore cannot be used. ---  --- The case I didn't need, but it does fit well and looks to be decently constructed. The power adapter seems to work fine. So basically I spent $9.99 and am only using the power adapter. I guess that's a good enough deal. I think I'll go spend some extra money and get a brand name earbud/headset though
the nokia bl-4c battery i got is a counterfeit with fake number 0406040703000042032
This cover is great, it provides a buffer from scratches and absorbs some of the trauma to the phone if dropped. It isn't soft leather so if you want to protect your RAZR you might want to consider a shield
This is probably the BEST popcorn you can make at home, packaged with the Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper, and you have a great little gift set. ---  --- Sidenote:  It probably isn't the healthiest Popcorn for you (there is a lot of oil and butter flavoring), but it is the tastiest!!
This book is typical for many of its kind, just a man-hating drivel from feminists...and otherwise good for nothing
As a chef in a hot DC kitchen, I have tried all manner of powder and cream with the hope of eliminating or decreasing chafing.  At one point, I even devised a kind of "rosin bag" of cornstarch suspended on a string... ---  --- THIS STUFF WORKS FOR ME.  And if it works for me, in the hours of blistering heat and hot sweat... it will work for you
The Sunday Philosophy Club, and the other 2 titles in this series by John McCall Smith, are everything the fans of Mme Ramotswe would hope they would be. Leaving Botswana was hard, but now we are in Edinborough Scotland, and Isabelle Dalhousie is as wise and vulnerable and real and wonderful as her African predecessor.  It is a miracle that a man can write his women characters so believably and so lovably. It is another miracle that anyone can write such absorbing, cozy, engrossing books. This is good literature and good fun. The Sunday Philosophy Club along with Friends, Lovers,Chocolate, and the more recent The Right Attitude Toward Rain, are too wonderful to miss. Welcome to Scotland
I have been using this starter kit for almost a month and I am beginning to see results. My experience with this product has been that my skin definitely got worse before it got better. For the first few weeks, my skin seemed to explode with more acne than usual... however, last week it started to clear up rapidly. I'm still having blemishes pop up daily, but they disappear within a few days, and overall my skin is much smoother and my (many, many) scars are less visible. I have struggled with moderate to severe acne for 6 years and have tried more products and treatments than I care to remember, and decided to try Murad after it was suggested to me (I'd never heard of it before). It certainly is no "miracle" product where you see results instantly (especially if you have a moderate to severe acne problem), but I just re-ordered the starter kit and am hoping the results will continue to improve. This product is definitely worth a shot
Whatever you do, dip these in milk when you eat them.  Not for long, just long enough for saturation.  They are out of this world.
I bought this as a gift for my husband. He loves it, it works great, looks great, and the price was awesome! ---  --- The bragging points of this watch are that the face is large, the numbers are easily readable, it keeps great time because it is atomic,  and the hands and numbers glow in the dark for nighttime viewing.  ---  --- The model we bought had a metal-link silver band, and I wish I could have bought the plastic/leather band, but it was not available at the time.  The silver band looks great and my husband liked it, but for work he has to have a non-metal band. We replaced the band with a plastic/rubber one, and the watch is still looking great, and my husband can use it for work or dressy situations!   ---  --- I can't believe the great price we got this watch for. It is really a perfect watch for men. 
First off, I cannot believe how mad this game has made me.  I like all kinds of games, but honestly trying to figure out some of the levels in this game left me stumped.  It's one thing to be stuck somewhere and have to retry a lot, but several times during this game I was stuck in an area and had no idea where to do/what to do, etc... even after I killed all the bad guys I didn't know how to get out of the room.  This game is not intuitive (sp?) at all! ---  --- Secondly, this game should not be called the Incredibles, it should be called Mr. Incredible, because you play as him almost all the time.  Playing as Elasta-Girl is great, I really enjoyed that part, but when there are a lot of baddies with guns, Mr. Incredible is a pain since he has no way to block anything, so you spend a lot of time getting pushed back until the bad guys reload. ---  --- I liked the first mission as Dash (when you play as Dash, which is only twice) you have to run fast; however the second mission I just lost my patience because I had to restart about a million times because I couldn't see what was ahead of me. ---  --- Playing a Violet was bad, they should have done a lot more with her instead of a boring stealth mission.  The Incredi-ball mission Incredibi-sucked, it took me like an hour to hit something because it was in a difficult place. ---  --- I'm just finishing up the game now and quite frankly I haven;'t enjoyed a lot of it, which is a shame because I really loved the movie.  Some of the levels are too hard because you can barely find the way to do something and Mr. Incredible needs to do more than punch people.  Currently I'm on the Rocket Silo level and I keep falling down trying to get onto a platform.  What a load of fun that is to do 100 times or more.   ---  --- Bottom line:  Playing as Elasta-girl was fun, everything else was either blah, or made me want to swear a lot.  Hopefully the second game will be better.  I'll be renting that instead of buying, this game left me disappointed overall
The presentation of computer enhanced b&w images that in some cases were sort of new added limited value to my extensive video library, legacy of my father. However, the aural commentary of Brannagh was repetitive and boring, each episode basically repeated the same 6+ octagenarian survivors exact same comments and reflections.
I've found the recipes here generally simple and easy to make ahead.  Mrs. Burros is very clear in her instructions (although I had some problems with a chocolate roll)and the taste combinations are very good.  As this book is an update of her original there are a number of amusing asides on changes in food ingredients and cooking styles between the two editions.  Not quite a "must-have" but useful
I was excited to purchase Jonathan product after watching two seasons of Blow Out.  Unfortunately, I was really disappointed after using this conditioner on my hair.  My hair is very thick and after using this conditioner it left my hair a sticky and tangled mess. ---  --- Unfortunately, the fragrance of the conditioner is great but that's about it
I have never ever used an application that was totally designed to get more and more money.  Every other page is a sales page and after paying $300 plus for the application and another $200 for the payroll, now I have to pay if I want their help.  It is a good tool but the company mission is to make more money, no longer has anything to do with their customers. --- And this customer will not be one next year
I'd give this movie a negative star if I could.  AVOID this movie. It's terrible. Not one positive thing could be said about this movie
This Mos Def album is a good album to listen to.  He shows off his lyrical skills and gives social commentary that is on point.  Why listen to a bunch of guys who have "lil"  in front of their names when you can listen to a man give his views on life, love, and this country we live i
I bought this swim cap for my wife for Christmas and she loves it
seems to be good quality. has a strong rubber scent, and no cutouts for the 4 small buttons though
I have not received even one issue yet, what seems to be the problem?????? I am giving no stars whatsoever, and I demand an explanation
What can I say if you like Clint Eastwood your going to like this movie.  I Have not seen this movie since it played at my local drive-in!  What  memories
This product link needs to be corrected, as the battery contained in the kit is NOT the same battery which is used in the DCR-DVD7.  Do not purchase this accesory kit if you intend to use it for the DCR-DVD7 camera.
My 15 month old has been playing with this for a few months and really likes it.  He plays with it just about everyday.  Everytime we have kids come over to visit it seems to be a big hit too.  They all love trying to make baskets.   --- The flaws are that it is loud and I wish the baseball and football did more or made noise.  They don't get played with as much as the basketball part since it sings and makes crowd noises.  --- Overall it's great as long as it keeps the kids entertained!
Let me start by saying that I ordered this rowing machine on April 2 and it arrived on April 5!  I was so excited! ---  --- Even though it has poor instructions on putting this machine together, it isn't impossible.  The tension strap is twisted around part of the machine that needs to be unwrapped first and that is not mentioned in the instructions.  Also, two of the steps seem to be out of order, but I still give this product a 5 star rating.   ---  --- When I was in college, I used a machine like this in their exercise room and loved it.  This is just like it, but I think it's even better.  I don't have a problem with the foot holders on this machine like I did with the one at college. ---  --- The quality is great for the value.  I feel that I have enough resistance and that I'm getting the workout that I'm looking for.  I use an elliptical rider first, then I get on my rower.  This is now rounding out my workout and I love it!  My elliptical rider is a gym quality machine and was very expensive but worth the cost.  This rower is inexpensive, but doesn't feel like a cheap machine.  Again, I am thrilled with it.  ---  --- By the way, I don't think that you can tell it in the picture, but the fan cover has holes all the way around it.  When I'm working out I can feel the breeze that it is generating.  It doesn't blow me away, but it's enough to cool me off some. ---  --- I hope you find the machine you're looking for.  If you're looking to save some money and get a great workout, this may be the rower for you. 
Ted Kheel has written a masterful, poignant and important book. In an increasingly litigious and contentious world, his is a voice of reason, compassion and true vision. As Karl Llewellyn observed, "Technique  without compassion is a menace, and compassion without technique is a  mess." Mr. Kheel gives us both, in a manner that is brilliantly  accessible, thought-provoking and inspiring
Delivered as advertised. --- Good strong quality material - covered my Weber like a glove. --- Difficult to find a cover that was not black so I was delighted to find a quality alternative. --- No complaints
I saw this flick when it first came out, and was chilled to the bone.  It was one of the movies that helped form my opinion about New York City, as well - as a cold, impersonal city where anonimity could swallow you up! ---  --- Over 35 years later, on review, it is still one of the scariest movies ever made. The twists are nuanced and plentiful, as well as psychologically and emotionally devastating.  Looking for monsters?  One need only look in the mirror. ---  --- Roman Polanski was - and still is, as far as I can tell - a master manipulator of perception.  Rosemary's Baby is one of his finest films, and its timeless theme - the struggle between good and evil - unfolds in a way that is as real today as it was when first released. ---  --- Oh, and I braved coming to New York 10 years after the film premiered.  Still here and loving the city!  I realized eventually, of course, that New York, as in so many films, was merely a great setting that provided a wonderful backdrop for this chilling tale to unfold.  A player in the molding of the film's atmosphere - but not the cause! It could have been set anywhere, and been just as effective. 
I can never understand why others would want to use anything else, I have tried four others and this one has been the best of all. I now have been using this product starting about 1989, I upgrade about every 3 to four year
I got this bag for under $15 and it is worth every penny. It fits my Canon ZR850 and accessories. It looks nice and it seems to be a great quality.
I just got through with fitting the strings and they sound a lot better than my last set of strings, no troubles whatsoever, they didn't break when I was fitting them either.  If you are new or even experienced with guitar and trying to figure out what kind of strings you should get, then these would probably be your best bet.  Great tones, smoothe strings that don't grind your fingertips, and really strong material for the weekend sessions. 
This is the worst item you can get for your 360. I got one and started experiencing many problems with my 360. It was crashing and freezing and ultimately I had to get my console repaired. Do not get this unless you want to hurt your baby (360)
On any list of pure English-language business reportage, BARRON'S would figure in the top ten. This newspaper-style weekly compiles more numbers than just about any other publication. ---  --- Though 'fluff' is not a word commonly associated with the Wall Street Journal, think of BARRON'S as 'WSJ without the fluff'.  That's how focused it is. ---  --- Electronic availability of business numbers has pushed BARRON'S off the 'must read' list, though it has its guild of old faithful readers who consider nothing else its equal. Published by Dow Jones, it is as focused on Wall Street as any publication could be. ---  --- Business people appreciate its 'Review  & Preview' section, which at a glance brings a reader up to speed on last week's business news leaders and next week's announcement and world holidays affecting business. ---  --- WSJ and the Economist will give you more extensive analysis. ---  --- Without slighting its columns and feature articles, BARRON'S is for the pure numbers guys and gals among us. They're all in here. Honest
This album has some of the best country songs in the business.  Mark sings songs straight from his heart.  There are songs for every occasion from the slow ballads like "Too cold at home", "I'll think of  something else", and "Almost goodbye" to the fast, heels  kicking "Bubba shot the jukebox", and "Going through the big  'd'".  These songs are about real life realtionships  and how they  affect the heart. So if you're in the mood to cry about that lost love or  smile now that they're gone this is the album for you
This was my first year using Turbotax, and it's also my last! ---  --- Since 1992 I was a faithful user of HR Block's Taxcut for Mac.  In spite of it costing more than the Windows version, I used it every year except for 1995 when various problems related to my AOL dial-up service prevented me from using it.  Since TurboTax is the only option out there for people who use a Mac, you'd think I'd be continuing to use them for now on, - but you'd be wrong! ---  --- I purchased my copy of TurboTax Deluxe from Amazon.com to save $5.  Since TaxCut made certain that no information from it's software could ever be imported by other software, I filled in my personal data as I began.  I was a little disappointed that TurboTax doesn't allow you to skip the "step-by-step" method, and just fill in the actual forms the way TaxCut did as an option.    While the downloads were an annoyance (6 or 7 separate files each time), for the most part the software was OK.  Picking up from where you leave off wasn't always possible, but 5 or 6 clicks would get you back to the right spot. ---  --- My first major annoyance came with the state software.  After filling in some data, and seeing the overall results, I wanted to look at the forms to see what they were doing with my data.  I also needed to see where they had placed data that was imported from the federal information I'd entered.  Well, there's no way to see your data on state forms until you're finished and print them out (or preview as .pdf files from the print dialogue).  When you do that the software somehow magically creates the state forms for printing, but the state forms don't seem to exist anywhere else except in that print spool!  I found this extremely annoying, and a real time waster. ---  --- The final blow, however, was when I got to filing.  The advertising is an unnecessary annoyance.  Since I don't owe any state taxes, I just usually print those forms out and mail them in --- it doesn't make any sense to me to pay for filing something when I don't owe anything and I'm not going to benefit from that "faster" refund.  Then I came to the crusher.  TurboTax wanted $30 for e-filing my Federal forms!!  TaxCut charged $14.95 and $15.95, but then they always rebated the cost.  I was told that Intuit used to do that, but obviously they decided to make some additional money this year.  Earlier in the day that I filed the saw the head of the IRS on CNBC being interviewed. He said that e-filing makes their job so much simpler.  Well, if it helps them that much, they should devise a way for computer users who buy software to file returns directly to the IRS without Intuit, H R Block and the others as middlemen.  And they should let us file for free if it makes their work so much easier. ---  --- While I have had my doubts about the services that allow you to fill out online forms, and then do your filing for you, I haven't heard of any security problems with them, so that's the direction I'm planning to take next year.  As far as I'm concerned, TurboTax blew it by being unfair with their e-filing fees
After having my Silver B for 7 years, the origional porcelin bars were very rusty. My grill would flare up terribly. I thought it might be from the rust holding the drippings and grease and making the flares worse. I was right! These stainless units (the length is listed wrong here) are great! I just cooked brauts without a flare up! Price was great; thanks Amazon
I bought this for Christmas for my three children ages 4 (twins) and 18 mos. Although the younger child doesn't really get the games we play with it, the older ones do and we all have a great time. My goal was to get them to be active during the winter (less TV time), and this works for about 30 minutes. I only wish we had a bigger house so I could have gotten the bigger parachute. I can't wait to play with it outside when it gets warm
These socks are absolutely the best. I take pilates classes and if it is hot your feet can slip off the mat. (Not good in the middle of a side plank!)Anyway these socks keep your feet planted and dry. One note; make sure not to order them big, the idea is that they should be snug
I bought this hood after reading elsewhere that it fits the 50mm f/1.8 Mark I (the version with the metal mount and distance scale) that I purchased recently.  Canon specs the discontinued ES-65 hood for this lens.  The great thing about this ET-65III is that it is longer, so it blocks more stray light without vignetting on full-frame or 1/6-frame slrs.  The interior on this mark III version is also flocked, providing a bit more light absorption. ---  --- I've used those collapsible rubber hoods before while in college, but this hood is definitely worth the investment:  well built, fits backward on the lens for storage (but too long while the lens is on the camera), and provides good protection for the front of the lens (it's quite deep). ---  --- Note that this will NOT fit the newer 50mm f/1.8 Mark II version (all plastic mount with no distance scale)
This is one of the worst edited documentary I have ever seen. --- You can not have a single shot spoiled with flashes, slow motion, and unnecessary digital FX.  --- I have nothing against crazy editing when it is for a 3 min MTV music clip or a TV add. But on a 7 hours documentary you get airsick. --- If fine edited, all this interresting story could have been told in less than two hours. --- Each episode has a more than 2 min introduction...  --- During the episodes you see some shots more than ten times. ---  --- By the way, I am a very long time aviation enthousiast
Frustration is how I sum up my experience with this product.  On the front cover, and with the directions on the back, there is a photo of a key that locks and unlocks the magnetic lock.  However, after opening the packaging, there was no key.  There were four locks, alright.  And, lots of little screws in case you felt like screwing the lock in, despite the product's claim to be the only child lock that doesn't require tools.  With how the packaging is designed, I don't even think there's room for the key.  Which makes me wonder...do you have to buy the key separately?  I'm returning this product and am bitterly disappointed for the wasted time and energy
The one star is for the bag it comes in. You can take these things along with you...but honestly, how many of these things will you really need? Maybe just two of them, the nail clippers and the bulb syringe...I have the set, given to me as a gift. I say, just buy these things separately, it's cheaper and then go out and buy a simple bag to take along with you...it's more practical than buying this whole set..
An English Teacher's review.  To my fellow educators: ---  --- I have just finished spending the better part of an afternoon watching all three film versions of "Treasure Island."  I've seen the version with Charlton Heston, the one with Jack Palance and the 1950 Disney version. ---  --- It is my unpleasant duty to report that a proper film of "Treasure Island" has apparently not yet been made, as all three were so abysmally bad that I was unable to finish them. ---  --- What no director has yet come close to capturing, is the relentless grandeur with which the book itself unfolds, and the simple directness of Stevenson's 19th century morality tale.  Without exception, all three of these films seem to flounder in a sea of confusion about what this book should actually be; and none of them seem to have even the tiniest jot of the kind of vision displayed by classic illustrators such as Wythe. ---  --- Again and again with each film, someone seems to have made the decision that the story exactly as told by Stevenson apparently wouldn't be interesting enough or exciting enough for the big screen.  What I really want to know is if any of these directors actually READ the book, or had a personal relationship with it?  I find it hard to believe that they did, since the films all give the impression of slapdash commercialism or outright confusion about what the book actually is. ---  --- Jim Hawkins is living quietly with his parents in a seaside inn, when the Captain shows up with his sea chest and a mysterious fear of "a seafaring man with one leg."  The Captain should be tall, mysterious, powerful and terrifying.  In two of these films, he seems to be played by short wrinkled winos; and in the third by some middle-aged guy who is apparently married to the lighting director's sister.  It only gets worse from there. ---  --- The tragedy of the Captain is that he is still physically vigorous and imposing at the start of the book - but Stevenson is bringing a doom to him that will shatter even the English oak of his adamant constitution - the combined forces of rum, terror and stroke. ---  --- The Captain's fate - to fall dead of a "thundering apoplexy" on the floor of the inn, forshadows the essential purpose of Stevenson's novel - to illustrate that a life of bloodthirsty avarice and short-sighted greed leads only to an ignominious death.  In the guise of a boy's adventure story, Stevenson pursues this deeper moral with a terrible purpose and with great dignity and power.  His pirate characters are not comic or lighthearted.  They are not caricatures.  They are not the wax mannequins of a Disney ride; they are real men with fears and desires and second thoughts; even with regrets.  They do not dance or traipse merrily through this story - they grimace and battle through it, gritting their teeth against the death, (from violence, sickness, treachery or rum,) that is always staring them in their faces.  Jim Hawkins' innocence and youth is the perfect foil for the pirates' hard-bitten cynicism and gold-lust.  It is no accident that, despite the courage and resourcefulness of the cabin party, (led by Captain Smollett,) it is still only Jim Hawkins' youthful optimism and curious spirit that ultimately saves them from "death at the hands of the pirates."  Stevenson is alluding to the biblical command to "be like the little children in order to be saved." ---  --- To tell this story properly, it must be told absolutely straight, and with the same committed earnestness with which Stevenson tells it.  None of these films is that brave. ---  --- To make a film that is faithful to Stevenson's moral, the director will need more courage and simplicity of purpose than we find in all three of these films combined.  Those of us who love and understand the novel for what it is must continue to hope for a film that does it justice.
This product is a box o' junk.  My son got this for Christmas this year and it is not even worth whatever the person paid for it.  The hat fell apart within three days (and he hardly played with it - just wore it on his head a few times) - the metal rim around the hat came undone and now there is a sharp metal point sticking out through the cloth on the hat, which is obviously dangerous.  I contacted the company and they have not responded. 
Did not work with my Palm T|C right away. --- I've not used this for any other purpose. I expect either Palm or SD to release proper software to have it work with Palm T|C
A red star!?!?  I bet this won't sell well in eastern Europe.
I chose this watch because of the stunning, and currently very fashionable, 'Rolex green' colour - and because the price was right.  --- So how does it stack up?  --- Nice bright yellow display box to keep it safe during shipping and storage, watch was well protected as well with clear plastic wrap over all surfaces.  --- The quality and finish are excellent, and the watch is easy to set for day and date.  --- It has a clear back, so you can see the motion spring mechanism at work - pretty cool.  --- Clasp and strap are well finished and work well - rotating bezel lines up perfectly at 12 O'clock - nice sweeping hand movement. Great look and great value
This Lady Grey loose tea is a sensory experience. It is light and citrusy with just the right kick of caffeine. The flower petals are pretty but I cannot taste any difference they might make in the steeped tea. It would make a nice gift for a woman who you don't know very well. All in all it is worth a try
I am a diabetic and I can not eat regular pastas made from refined white flour. They boost my sugar up to high because of all the carbs. Dream fields  low carb pasta s has allow me to make and eat pasta again. --- They also taste no different than regular pasta . This is a great product  --- with great taste and low carbs
Sure, it's not 100% pure vanilla extract.  That's indicated quite clearly in the ingredients.  Molina vanilla is made with a mixture of pure vanilla extract and synthetic vanillin.  Personally I love its strong distinctive flavor, regardless of what percentage pure vanilla extract it is.  For those who feel it's too strong, use half the amount listed in the recipe.  I know a couple of people who do this when using Molina Vanilla.  Again, I like the flavor, so I use the full amount called for in the recipe.  This stuff has a great flavor that really kicks things up a notch
The earrings delivered were as described and will certainly work for me.  I was a bit disappointed in the strength and flexibility of the gold wire.  These earrings were much more flexible that the 25-year-old pair I was replacing.  I doubt that the new ones are as strong and will hold up as well.  However, they do what I need them to do and can be worn around the clock without irritation
I bought one for a relative last Christmas. Saw how convenient and easy it was to program. So I bought one for myself this March. It works just great. ---  --- The setup software programs the 670 easily and the Logitech remote replaces the remotes for a HDTV, a DVD Home Theater A/V Receiver, a DishHD DVR Receiver, and a Psyclone PSC01 Source Selector.  One button click now setups all those devices to the right status for a particular entertainment activity.  ---  --- I like the color screens and icons on the higher end  Logitech remotes .. but the discrete placement of buttons on the 670 is much more practical for me to use. Function wins forms this time round. ---  --- All is not rosy though. Added the Sony PS3 to the   entertainment arena.  The Bluetooth requirements of the PS3 leaves it out of the IR RF remotes inner circle. Consider this  if you need a combined solution for Infra Red  RF as well as Bluetooth devices. ( The Sony PS3 is deliberately left powered on so it is not an issue in this case). Fully backlit is a signifcant bonus..none of the replaced remotes had adequate backlit features.  ---  --- Short version: This cool tool really works and should satisfy most. Think "out of the box" though if you have a Sony PS3 tied into your entertainment network.  ---  --- ..click
My first Aquis mitt was rectangular. I like this one better.  Rounding the edges makes sense since it is meant to be worn on the hand.  Aquis microfiber is the only fabric I use on my face. It is gentle on the skin, yet cleans more thoroughly than anything else I have used. (I find it amazing that both attributes apply to the same fabric!) ---  --- If the manufacturer is listening, I would like to be able to buy the mitts in sets of 2. This would be perfect for bathing baby/children. There is a slit in the seam, on the thumb side, so your thumb can protrude. You can grip/lift without removing your mitts. Some size choices (S/M & L/XL) would be nice, as this mitt would not fit a large man's han
I bought this speaker about one year ago from Best Buy, very disappointed.  The sound quality is terrible, I have two presence channel $15 KLH speakers that sound better than this.  No high end speakers have cabinets made of plastic, hence why Bose is not  high end.  After a year of misery on my ears, I've replaced this with a Paradigm center speaker that only cost $20 more, and the difference is not even comparable.  Do not buy this, or any Bose product at all.  Save your money and buy Paradigm, B&W, or similar, most of the time they cost a little bit more, but sometimes actually less and are actually high end speakers, and you will get your money's worth
Peter Allen takes three of the most compelling aspects of human history--sex, disease, and religion--and weaves them together in a fascinating exposition of how religious authorities in the West have viewed  disease since the late Middle Ages. His book discusses the histories of  lovesickness, leprosy, syphilis, plague, masturbation, and of course AIDS.  For each disease (and yes, masturbation was considered a serious disease  well into the 20th Century!), he discusses how sex, and the sins associated  with it, figured into the religious and popular views of illness. Allen's  book is meticulously researched (he read texts in the original French,  Latin, German, and Italian) and elegantly  written. It is a far easier read  than most academic works. Most importantly, it offers insight into how  religious and sexual  intolerance can hamper the fight against disease,  even in today's world
I was so excited to find a portable potty b/c we like to travel and my son is finally potty training. Well I opened it for the first time about 4 months ago and what a disappointment!  My son is 2 and absolutely could not stand sitting on this the first time. It's too small and pinches. I tried to maneuvere his bottom so that it would be more comfortable. no positioning worked.  if your child has a tiny bottom then go for it, otherwise, skip this one
I've been trying for 2 weeks now, adding 1-teaspoon to my normal shake or yogurt.  It dissolves easily.  I feel more energy throughout the morning hours.  What I like best is that it's from Brazil so it's the real thing and less expensive than other brands.  The label was folded over a bit but that's ok.  They ship fast - it arrived in my mailbox in 3 days.  Thanks Amazon for offering unique items such as this...   --- My husband and I love it
Whenever I think of the Second World War, the two places I usually think about in terms of carnage is the Eastern Front; and the war between Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia. The other is the Pacific Campaign between the USA and Japan. One of the reviewers wrote, "I'm glad the Russian Won." So am I. And what a bloody war it was. The number of casualties and amount of destruction make what occurred in the others parts of the globe [except Asia] seem pale in comparison. The Russians suffered greatly at the hands of the Germans, and the German army paid one hell of a steep price. ---  --- Also, it was in the east where the Germans committed some of the most horrendous atrocities known to mankind. It was in the east where extermination camps were set up to murder millions of Jews: The German  program of the 'Final Solution.' Everything I have ever read about the  Second World War concerning the eastern front is one of brutality on a scope that is horrifically mind-boggling. It's as if life were cheap and each day may have been the last. This documentary does a very decent job in attempting to address the fighting between these two armies. From Barbarossa to Berlin, it is one of the best documenatries out there. At least for the 200 minutes that the film devotes to the eastern front. I don't believe this is the definitive documentary, as more and more information is being released now that the Soviet Union is no more. But for now, I highly recommend this film. [Stars: 4.5]    
I purchased this camera online one month ago from amazon here ---  --- [...] ---  --- And I have taken pictures from Alaska to Florida and in Washington I love how the Mark II captures images IMHO more clearly than any film SLR could ever take. ---  --- Best Camera I have every use
This tub is a waste of money.  I bought it this evening and I'm returning the tub first thing tomorrow morning.  Water leaks at the hinges creating a mess and a slippery, unsafe floor.   ---  --- Very unsatisfied with this product
   I am so pleased with this purchase!! Under normal circumstances if I spend anything over $1.00 I get caught in a spiral of buyers regret. This is a feeling that I have grown accustomed to. When I received the 800,000 through the mail I shredded open the box and started skimming through what new images I could play with. I was astonished!       ---    Then, I realized something.....or rather a lack of something. I felt no remorse for buying this! I finally had a collection of clip art that could provide an abundant amount of images for collages, labels, calendars, scrapbooks, and everything else I wanted to do. 
I had to return my 1st order due to mould on the wood (around the joins) and inside the glass front. My replacement has a little mould inside the glass front, but I decided I could live with it.. I blame Amazon's storage for this rather than the manufacturing of it by LaCrosse. ---  --- The glass front is spherical, so tends to get weird light reflections, so watch for this when you are hanging it. ---  --- Note that when the battery is low, the second hand will move in 2 second jumps to let you know that the battery is low - this is a feature, not a problem, which I like. ---  --- Other than that it works great! (I live close to Boulder and NIST, where the radio signal comes from, so also take this into account when ordering any radio controlled clocks).
This cereal really tastes good. I make it in the microwave, first heating the fresh cold water to boiling, then adding the cereal, stirring and returning it to the microwave to finish cooking. I let it boil and bubble for a bit in the microwave, which is when the cooking really occurs. I often let it sit in the microwave for a few minutes after it stops, to set up. Years ago a ham radio guy asked me (over the air!) whether I knew how to make gourmet microwave hot cereal. I said no - wondering how you could make anything gourmet, especially cooked cereal, in the microwave - but that I didn't express out loud... so he explained to me the above method, with emphasis on heating the cold water before adding the cereal. And definitely not using hot tap water, as that has the O2 chased out of it, or some such. So I guess that must be it! ---  --- I used to laboriously mix various cereal grains to achieve this kind of mix, but with this product it is all done for me. It's also good with raisins added. ---  --- I'm delighted that Amazon is selling some of these healthy food items that are hard to find in parts of the country. The special offers bring the price within reason.
I was going to buy this and then stumbled on it in the doctor's office. I love InStyle, Lucky and other shopping mags, but the tone of this is mean and snooty. There are too many ads, and very little content. There's a Q&A section about sex after baby that's just mean, threatening that if you don't jump back in, "one of you will start sleeping with the girl in marketing..." Way to put an anti-feminist tone on sex after baby. Yuck.
We bought this guitar for our smaller seven year old son. It was hard to choose a guitar, because there are so many out there...toy version and real...but which to choose?  This one is worth the pos. feedback I am giving it. It seemed so small and cute when I opened it, but it is perfect for little hands and bodies!  I found the price very reasonable since we aren't sure if he will "keep the interest",(some toy ones cost close to this) but yet I wanted him to feel like he was getting a REAL guitar, in hopes that he will keep learning.  I found that the guitar is very nice, not a toy at all, tunes well, looks very attractive and sounds nice too.  I was impressed that it came with a warranty.  I am happy that I didn't spend close to this for the toy versions...and I got the real deal instead.  Shipping was INCREDIBLY fast from this company
We were amazed that this film wasn't an award winner.  It is an excellent film, and you might even see some style similarities between Howard Roark and Frank Lloyd Wright. 
It has made my bookkeeping for my small business soooo easy. Invoices in a flash,keep track of your expenses so easily. This program was the best investment and tax deductible! Very easy not complicated!
After hearing a lot of the songs used for other Fisher Price music toys, I expected the best from this one. I liked the songs included on the rom, but I expect a nice beat and catchy tune. (Like the Backyardigans or the Doodle Bops). These songs are performed in a dry sort of way. They aren't even as good as the Wiggles and my kids hate the Wiggles. It was a bit disappointing
It is difficult to use words harsh enough to describe this product and this company. --- I have owned this software for about 80 days.  --- 1. In 80 days of use this product has completely locked up or not opened twice. --- 2. I have called the 'support' line 4 times. The minimum time I was on hold was 40 minutes. --- 3. My initial 'support' period is about to expire and I now will have to pay $200 to get more 'support' --- 4. You have to buy additional software to get your data onto a palm device. ---  --- In summary: The product has locked up about every 40 days and the average hold time is 40 minutes when you call them. ---  --- Save yourself the grief - buy nothing or buy something else
This worked great for a couple months.  Then the monkey that moves up and down started making a loud clicking noise.  The gears must be slipping.  My poor baby gets really excited to kick the parrot to make the monkey move, then gets scared at the loud clicking/popping noise and starts crying.  Really sad
The magazine was exactly what I wanted and super cheap through Amazon.com. I am happy with my purchase
I was able to reach the top of the windows in my two story foyer with this wonderful product. I need to point out I am 5'4".  I did need the assistance from my boyfriend (who is 6'1") to reach the ceiling to remove the cobwebs...but he did it and they are GONE!   --- I just received my Simple Clean today and I have already tried three attachments. The ceiling fan attachment worked well. I used the duster to dust my window panes in my foyer as well as my fragile lighting. LOVED IT! We also used the spider web remover and it was great! I recommend this product to everyone!
After breaking the collective hearts of the soft rock-loving populace by leaving the powerhouse group Chicago, Traitor Cetera made a half-baked attempt to reconcile himself with his fanbase by recording this stinker.  It's coincidental that the first track is titled "Big Mistake", as if Traitor knew his leaving one of the premier groups of our time was the worst decision he would ever make.  I bought this album way back in 1986 with some birthday money, and after I had listened to the album once, I made myself go and apologize to all of my family members for wasting their money so foolishly. ---   --- What else is here?  Oh, you have the "Karate Kid II" ballad "Glory of Love", a tune so nauseating it's made me completely ignore the second film in the canon, and go straight from the original "Karate Kid" to "III" and "Next" whenever I do my yearly film marathon.  I just pretend the second film never existed.  It also has the semi-smash "Next Time I Fall", where Traitor makes it a point to hog the spotlight completely from guest vocalist Amy Grant. ---   --- In short, if you a) thought Cetera's leaving Chicago was a great decision, or b) like your music pointless and nauseating, by all means get this album.  If you want music with real heart and soul, just go buy some Chicago.  You'll be glad you did
slowed a new system down too much when running in backgroud. Went back to free verison
Looks nice... but beware! ---  --- Installed Norton 360 on the 6 workstations in our small office.  As soon as I did that our accounting system (Peachtree) started to lock up a few times a day.  Even after turing off the firewall on all workstations the accounting system still locked up. ---  --- I've now uninstalled Norton 360 on the server PC and that seems to have solved the problem. ---  --- I wish now that I had just upgraded from Norton Internet Security 2005 to 2007...  Never again.
I bought this for my son's second Christmas; he was almost 2.  It was a recommendation of one of my parenting magazines and I had to hunt it down 3 years ago. He loved pounding the balls and he even could match the color of the ball to the color of the hole!  He still plays with it and I will be buying his baby brother one when he's big enough
They taste so great I had to limit how many my kids could eat each day.
Received the watch on Saturday, Dec. 23, which was ordered Thursday, Dec. 21 in the late evening. The watch is beautiful.  Thank you for the great service. 
this is a nice watch and give accurate time. I gave only 4 stars because it took me a hard time to pull the crown to adjust the time
This makes a great cake or cupcakes. I used a modification to make it a chocolate cake & it was a hit, and also baked them in little bear molds -- the kids loved them. I have 3 little grandgirls and a daughter who are celiac, and these mixes are the best thing to have in the house. No one non-celiac can tell the difference
This SUPER BRIGHT light is great!   ---  ---      * Its solar (no need to string wires from the house) ---      * It has a VERY bright light (sometimes solar lights can be on the weak side, but not this one) ---      * A person could attach it to other places outside to -- it does a great job peircing through the dark night. ---  --- DEFINIITELY A MUST OWN IF YOU HAVE A SHED OR DARK SPOT IN THE BACKYARD
I regret having purchased this product.  I have not been able to use it for two months, after finally giving up trying to get it to work.  I have a very nice laptop running Windows XP Home, and encountered many problems.  I tried all of the avenues available to me through QuickBooks, online, via email, and on the telephone.  I spent nearly 25 hours overall trying to get the numerous issues taken care of.  Here are just a few:  The program would not convert my Quicken data; random script errors when you try to access help topics within the product; the phone # provided in the payroll demo is invalid; None of my info was viewable after bank download - it spontaneously failed to download my bank account info, after having successfully downloaded it for about two weeks.  I spent 2 & 1/2 hours on the phone trying to resolve just this one issue.  Part of the problem lies in the fact that I was unable to speak to a customer service person who's first language was English.  Each time I was on the phone, the customer service person seemed to continually ask me to re-describe the problem, then he/she would seem to be typing the info into the computer and waiting....then eventually telling me some solution to try, then eventually telling me they did not know what the problem was.  Not helpful in any way, though very polite. I'm sorry to say that this is a terribly designed, convoluted, over-complicated, non-user-friendly item which I would like to toss over a cliff. 
This film having been produced in 1957, was seen by me in 1958 while serving as a D.I. AT P.I. It showed for two consecutive nights and I think every D.I. on P.I. somehow arranged to see it. We wanted to see if they got it right I guess. I viewed it again recently and it was most nostalgic. A most memorable time and the film was reasonably accurate for the times. I highly recommend it
I am very pleased with the locket.  It is a nice size, but not too big-definitely large enough to be engraved. The chain is pretty and appears to be strong.  It arrives in a lovely black velvet pouch and box.  My daughter was delighted with it
I ordered this phone on 3/28/07. It shipped via FEDEX on 3/29/07 to my office with an indicated delivery of 3/2/07. The package sat on the FEDEX truck for three days before they attempted to deliver it at 8pm to an adjacent business and then left it without the package being signed for. This was after I'd already called FEDEX to refuse delivery of the package because it was too late in arriving.  FEDEX's response for it sitting three days on the delivery truck was that the driver was overloaded.  For the $100 difference in price it was less hassle to just go to the local Cingular store.
the cap is nice and presumably does what it is suppose to do by keeping my hair out of my face. However, the stitching at the seam at the back of the cap began coming apart from the day that I first used it. It hasnt torn completely...yet. Nevertheless, I would think that putting a skull cap on once with my short hair would cause a tear so sooon. I wouldnt suggest this produc
The necklace is great.  It looks great and my wife loved it.  One of the diamonds was a little gray (something stuck behind it), but after having it cleaned at a jewelers, it looks fantastic. --- Great price for a great item
This is a thuroughly enjoyable movie; a pleasure to watch. THe acting, characters, and story are entirely plausible, and there is no grandstanding by primadonna actors, nor is there any of Hollywood's usual political preachiness (especially unusual considering Robert Redford's backing).  ---  --- THe only downside to the DVD is that it is full-screen, and not letterboxed. THe "bonus features" are somewhat lack-luster as well, and the menu system is laughable. Only one actor's credits have been updated since the movie was released, and the credits section is a token gesture at best. ---  --- Still, this is one of those cases where it is cheaper to buy the movie than rent it twice
I'm probably going to invest in a re-order of this DVD collection, because I simply have worn this one out. From the "They Call It Pro Football" opening to final gun of Super Bowl X, this collection grips your attention and never lets go. The writing is superb - I especially like NFL 68' - and The highlights... Well, it was when pro football was pro football.  ---  --- It was interesting watching teams endure psychological hardships, as was the Case with the Dallas Cowboys of the late 60's- Early 70's. "Next Year's Champions" were the epitome of resiliency.   ---  --- "The Championship Chase" was a pure joy to view. If ever there was a peak in John Facenda's narrative career with NFL Films, this was it; though in the alternative, I loved his voice-overs in Super Bowls III, IV, VII, and IX.   ---  --- Ed and Steve Sabol Really hit the bulleye with Blair Motion Pictures. I would have loved to see more AFL highlights, but that's just nit-picking.  ---  --- GREAT JOB!!!
I had a LOT of fun playing this game and look foward to playing more Nancy Drew products.  It was interesting and I couldn't WAIT to solve the mystery!  I enjoyed myself a lot! 
I have to tell anyone, who has lower back or foot pain, to try a pair of Merrells.  When you try them on, they feel comfortable, but once you wear them for a week, you'll never wear another brand of footwear (unless you have to).  Most of their shoes need no "break in" time.  I own these in four different colors.  My eldest daughter owns two pairs of these. I own more than 20 pairs of Merrells, I have been wearing these for years.  The cool thing about them is, when you see someone else wearing a pair, it's like you're both in on a secret.  You know, you're walking in heaven
This is the best "La Traviata."  I was so moved that I had to take a break.  It really touched me deeply!
THESE SEAT COVERS ARE ADORABLE. SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE PICTURE. THE FROGS ARE TIGHTLY STUFFED AND APPEAR REAL STURDY SITTING UP ON THE SEAT TOP. THE COVERS ARE DARK GREEN VELVET LIKE AND RICH LOOKING. BETTER THAN ANY IN THE STORES
After many disastrous leakage experiences with their smaller-size diapers, I decided to give Huggies another try because I have a very active toddler, and these certainly did appear to be stretchy and comfortable. Unfortunately, this comfort comes at the expense of utility. My daughter was no sooner running around in the first diaper out of the pack, when I saw the entire contents of her diaper coming out the sides and up her back. Just like the smaller sizes, this version does not hold anything in!!!
This is a great light - shines stars all over the room.  Constellations aren't quite right, but they're close.  The different color options are great.  For the price, it's a great deal
Years ago 'The Sporting News' was the fans' 'bible'. I can remember what a special feeling it gave to look at it, the real lowdown, the most bottom- line stuff , more statistics than even the greatest baseball nut could ever remember.  --- I no longer really follow the game, or any of the games as I once did. --- And most of the figures even the names of the players are strange to me now.  --- I picture in my mind my uncle the late Broadway Abe Freedman who lived his life to see the Yankees lose , picking up this paper and cursing at some columnist proclaiming the Yankees the favorites to take it all in the coming year. --- That coming year and so many coming years are already gone.  --- But there will be a next year, a next season, another Sporting News' and someone somewhere in America devouring those numbers as if they were crackers jack and cold beer at the seventh- inning stretch.
This is J.A. Jance at her worst and the readers simpering narrations doesn't help
Ok-I did not review any of the other comments on this game before posting this. I have been playing Final Fantasy games for a very long time... I still have (and play :p) Mystic Quest, Final Fantasy II and FF III for SNES.  ---  --- FF XII is the BEST Final Fantasy since #3 (US), in my opinion...and it is FUN!!!! The story line is AWESOME (kinda like Shakespeare meets King Arthur) and it reminds me a bit of final fantasy 3...only with awesome graphics! ---  --- My one peeve for all of the games was leveling up (HP and MP.) I felt like after I mastered the "new" way of doing it-they changed it for the next game!!! The old games did it automatically...after those, you had to equip things in order to gain strength, magic, and special abilities. This game combines what you have already learned from FF VII on...and if you have never played the game, there is a great tutorial that you can access at any time. ---  --- This game is just plain FUN...I think the MOST fun since FF III. You have the freedom to explore and wander without getting lost (there is a reminder at the bottom of the map and X's to show you where to go), you can see whatever you come into contcact with (friends and foes), and the storyline and gameplay are phenomenal
I had got these for my husband for christmas. Nice material, however they were too tapered at the ankle and also short for him and he is average height, so we had to return it
I did not finish the book (I got about 70% of the way through before I realized I could not bear to read one more page).  Maybe the remaining part of the book would have been better, but I doubt it.  This is the first time I can ever remember not even having even the slightest interesting in finishing a book.  The characters were flat and plot went nowhere.  Please - there are million of books out there.  Spare yourself, and find something else to read. Anything.
I've been using Quicken for Windows for years.  Since I recently bought a Mac, I thought I'd switch Quicken over from Mac to Windows.  Forget it!  The Mac version is totally incompatible with Windows, you must export your data and then re-import it on the Mac.  This works OK for simple checking / Visa accounts, but it **fails completely** for investment or brokerage accounts.  If you look on Quicken's support site, they say "Reinvest Dividend, Reinvest Income and banking transactions in an investment account must be *manually entered*"  Hello?!  Like I'm going to manually enter 12 years of investment transactions?  With most major products (Adobe Creative Suite, MS Office), the same files work transparently across Mac and Windows.  Quicken's inability to even import the data, nevermind actually opening it, reeks of incompetence.  Stay away from this product
I stumbled across this little gem almost by accident, and what a surprise it was.  The sheer breadth of subject matter could span half a lifetime.  We never forget the lessons of our youth, and each issue, like a great short story, will separate you from the mundane and transform the way you view literature.   And yes, you will return...time and time again. Are you trying to decide whether to devote your summer to reading Anna Karenina?  Perhaps it will ignite in you a love for the Great Russian novels, providing fodder that, like all firm foundations, could change the course of your life.  If it's the modern classics that you're interested in, one almost can't help but think along the lines of John Knowles.  Life marches on, and we choose whether to change or be changed.  Much is out of our control in this world, but what we choose to read is not. Regardless of your personal paradigm, you will find much of interest in this cleverly constructed work.   While the idea of a Holiday gift might seem obvious, why not consider surprising and old friend with a subscription? Does your friend really need that Springsteen coffee table tome?  Even as a belated wedding gift, it would no doubt be appreciated.  Don't stand around in bookstores, Starbucks in hand, flipping through page after page anymore...Oh, you don't do that, huh?  No, neither do I.  Just subscribe now.  I hope to find one in my mailbox soon. ---  --- -Timothy McPhail, Avondale Estates, GA
This stuff is amazing.  I use "Candle Light" underneath my eyes and around my brows.  It makes my eyes look picture perfect all day long.  It's especially beautiful in sunlight - really makes my blue eyes pop! 
I'm not sure quite what to say about the burners.  As expected, they work extremely well, and they were rather easy to install.  The only problem I had was with a bolt that had rusted and required a little time to get off.  Beyond that, I had my grill lit within 15 minutes of taking the burners out of the box
This is my second item of this type, and in the wintertime it is indepensible. With no garage to keep my SUV in, this cover fills the void. It is easy to put on, just takes a few minutes, and saves many minutes of scraping ice the next morning! This particular one is large enough for my SUV with some room to spare
 ---  --- Mistral, as many know, is a powerful, gusty wind that blows across the south of France. Mistral, as I was happy to discover, is also the name of a line of bath and body products, all French inspired, all lusciously lovely from scented soaps to soothing lotions to rejuvenating body butters.  ---  --- Matthew Tilker, founder and president of Mistral, utilizes Shea butter, which is an efficacious natural healer, in a myriad of must-have forms. Derived from the nuts of the African Shea Tree (according to sacred custom the nuts are harvested primarily by women), this butter is highly emollient, a boon for those with dry skin, chapped lips, any number of skin irritations.  ---  --- The pure Shea Butter soap comes in a plethora of inviting fragrances, all milled six times (while others boast being triple milled). South Seas is a particular favorite - it's as fresh as an ocean breeze and as calming, soothing as a tropical island. The marine scent is accented with a touch of grapefruit, white flowers and soft woods. An irresistible combination.  ---  --- South Seas is a fragrance with which you wish to surround yourself - made possible by the shower gel, body lotion, massage bath and body oil, bath salts and candle all available at very accessible prices.  ---  ---      - Gail Cooke
I have been completely satisfied with Jansport backpacks.  They are very well made and I love the guarantee.  The straps are more comfortable than other backpacks purchased.  My 14 year old son has had one for three years, and it is still in great condition.  Previous cheaper backpacks have lasted a year or two at the most.  This model has lots of zipper pockets in different sizes for storing just about anything you'd want to put in a backpack.  Great product
My cousin loves these dolls. She loves that she gets to be a "little mommy" to a boy AND girl...that's what i love about this set...plus the dolls are adorable and the only thing I don't like about them is the hats. I wish the hats were...cuter? I don't know but it doesn't matter. I'd buy these dolls for any really little girl. She used to cry when she lost accessories for her other dolls...but at least with these there isn't much to lose
This magazine is the best there is.  There is page after page of beautiful designs and excellent instructions.  I have bought some books that don't have as many beautiful knitting projects in them as one issue of this magazine
Excellent price, speed of delivery, and quality. I am very happy with this purchase
The watch is very pretty, sturdy enough for everyday wear and elegant enough for dressy occasions.  Excellent price and fast delivery.  I like the dual tone watch band, because I wear both white and yellow gold.  The gold isn't as brassy as what shows in the picture.  Excellent value
 --- These burgers are unbelievable. They are really fresh and juicy burgers with a distinctive meaty taste you will fall in love with if you love a great burger.  They are Omaha Steaks best product and the only thing I order from them. I actually love the packaging. Each burger comes individually wrapped in vacuum sealed plastic, which means I can keep them in the freezer until I am ready to eat them. Then defrost them in warm water and in 10 minutes I have fresh red meat, they have a nice peppery Angus beef smell, and they taste great. They never go to waste.  I find the meat I buy in the stores these days can't compare at all. Them smell of the meat doesn't smell fresh - more like plastic than meat. Ok, the Styrofoam cooler is a waste of packaging, and not environmentally friendly but they can be reused several times. ---  --- Amazon also has a great price on these. After a quick search around the web, this looks to be the best price
My primary camera is a Sony HDR-FX1. --- I bought the GL-2 as a second unit for multiple camera angles at sporting events. --- The GL-2 is a respectable camera but in my opinion the video image doesn't even come close to the Sony. --- The price and rebate offer was the greatest incentive in my purchase of this camera. --- However, beware of the rebate offer. --- I sent all the documents in strict compliance with the terms of the rebate only to have it rejected. --- The rebate facilitator claimed I did not include the UPC code. --- If I had it to do over, I would dig deeper into my wallet and buy a second Sony
I love the look of my Seiko. It's the best for the money. I will buy more Seikos in the future. It's a great product
This is a good quality item for the money.  I LOVE that the rails fold down so it is easy to make up the bed and change the sheets.  I just bought a second one for grandma's house! 
I bought the Rebel XT w/ the 18-55 lens exactly 18 hours before the XTI was introduced, but that's another story. As this is my first DSLR, I was blown away by the results. But after the initial euphoria, there is always room for improvement. My first choice was the 28-200, favoring the longer zoom over the IS, but I found this one used at Penn Camera and got a deal on it and a 380EX flash, so the decision was made for me.  --- I like the zoom range, it's great for framng portraits. If I need wider angle, I still have the kit lens.  --- I won't make the usual complaints about the herky-jerky zoom ring or the rackety extension tubes, as I was prepared for this by these reviews before I ever saw the lens. --- I'm no expert on sharpness, and still trying to get myself dialed in, but my shots so far look pretty sharp to me. I have no "L" lenses to compare to, nor would I make the comparison if I did.  --- In my somewhat uninformed opinion, this is a great step up from the kit lens. This is a lens a working guy can afford and most likely get great results with. Being a working guy, I'm extremely happy with it so far, and glad I made the purchase. 
What else could you expect from the belgian's... buy hey, jean-claude, at the premiere of cyborg you let me and my cousin in the rain.  You were stuck in brussels... so, i'll still owe you a signed poster ;) ---  --- This movie is what it's all about, off course, bruce lee was widely known.  But this one is trully magnificent... the story is based on a true-story, the movements are very very athletic and beautifull... to make it short... ---  --- THIS MOVIE HAS IT ALL !!! ---  --- More from this please instead of such stupid movies were chinese men make 7 flips in once while throwing some stars on top off a bus for example... ---  --- This movie let's you see what it really is... ART !!
If you own one of these shavers, then you need to replace with these every year. Buy the BEST, buy these, and shaver will stay like new
Hermann Baumann is one of the greatest horn players ever and he shows why he has been given that honor on this cd. I don't think that there is recording of the Haydn concerto that even comes close to this masterful performance, even better than Tuckwell's. The cadenzas are absolutely awesome. I haven't listened to the Rosetti before but Baumann sounds excellent in this concerto as well. Clevenger plays ok on the Haydn but his articulation is a little sloppy. I'm a saxophone player but I can recognize  true musicianship when I hear it and Baumann certainly is a brilliant musician. Highly recommended
We got this game free in a box of Corn Chex. We thought, Oh this will be fun since the show is cool. So we got home and played it and it was so annoying! There's just like a black screen before and after the question shows up and a black background. Just, don't buy it if you want to have any fun
  Love Sam Elliott; even when the material isn't tops, He is!  This one is really good
I think this software is excellent for biginning designers like me. It gives a great range of choices to help you expand your imagination & create new personal things each time you work. The only problem faced me was that it doesn't support other languages, but it works with wordart
Our daughter received this puzzle for her 3rd birthday.  She's a puzzle nut!  This became an instant favorite and had to be left together for all to see.  The picture sheet in it labels all the sea creatures and it becomes a great way to discuss the different levels of life in the ocean.  The coloring is beautiful - Mom and Dad enjoy it as well.  It is extrememly well built, sturdy and can really be wiped off with a damp cloth. ---  --- The only negative, as another viewer pointed out, is the darker bottom pictures.  Harder for young ones to distinguish designs and not as visually appealing.
I liked how you could go underwater and try to find things. I also liked how you had to bake cookies and make sundaes. Another really cool thing was that you could buy stuff for Minette and yourself. I didn't like how the tea was so hard,though.I couldn't figure it out,but finally I got it.I liked that you had to fight Minette,too.It was funny that she had an alien tatoo on her face.Over all,Danger By Design was a fun game.
This is the candy our two boys ask for the most. And their friends (and their parents) love them, too.  We gave them out for Halloween and had rave reviews back from neighbors. It's great to be able to give out candy to trick or treaters and to guests that we know won't hurt anyone (no peanuts, no corn, no artificial anything). Just great taste!  Rock on, Yummy Earth.
These wipes are awesome!  They got here real fast too! 
The product is compact and convenient, but it feels flimsy.  The hotsync function stopped working for a bit but was restored after I did a hard reset of my Palm TX--so it was not a cable problem but a problem with my TX.  For some reason, the cable won't let me charge using the USB wall-charger I got for my wife's iPod, but it does charge the TX off my computer's USB port (which is a Powerbook G4--notorious for being underpowered)
Ok. I can say I have been a realtor, a nurse,an HR person, a mom. That means a heavy phone user- since 1990. My first phone was the old motorola brick analog. One of the greatest and biggest phones ever. I remember my first digital phone, and first pnone with games. I have had a total of 5 phones, motorola, nokia, ericson, panasonic. This kyocera is the best. I don't want a treo palm because I already travel with a lap top. What I want is a text phone that is small and easy to use. This querty key board rocks. The menu is just like a computer and easy to make selections. The more features you need on the phone, the more you want a qwerty key board. Get this phone and be happy. Also the saleslady threw it on the ground and when the back came off she snapped it back on and used it. Very sturdy little phone, and the antena is the loop so it won't poke you. Comes with  a very easy to read guide book so start up is easy. I paid $199 for this phone in my region and it is worth every penny
i love this movie.  it's picture perfect in a life of a tweeker and their enviroment. ---  --- WHERE IS THE SOUNDTRACK TO THIS MOVIE?????
The chocolate crunch is my favorite of the gluten-free Nana's cookies, though the lemon is pretty good too.  I have a feeling the person who gave these 1 star is someone who can eat a freakin' cinnabon if she wants to.  For those of us who have dietary restrictions, it's a different story.   ---  --- It does take a while to get used to gluten free fare, but these cookies are among the best I've had, which is pretty impressive since they don't even have sugar in them.  And the fact that they don't have gluten, eggs, nuts, or dairy in them either is wonderful (yes, there are those of us out there allergic to all these things).  I just wish more stores carried them.  But now that I've found them on Amazon, I'll be ordering in bulk. ;
I absolutly love ALL of Carol's daughter's products.  Everything to me is true to description.  I recieved my Almond Cookie gift set in the mail and I couldnt wait to open it. The smell is to die for, sometimes I open my Shea Souffle' just so I can smell it. I also love her labels and containers.  I will forever be a customer of Carol's Daughter and I look forward to the day where I can walk into one of her stores. Her prices are worth every dime. Remember you get what you pay for
Great Conservative political journalism. Would've liked to read it when William Buckley was editor
Both versions of Scansoft cause my installer to have problems. Mainly it tries to re-install Softscan every time I start up Softscan. Also It has started to try and reinstall Softscan if I try to right click on a JPG. There is very little to no chance of getting any help from Scansoft (Nuance)to debug this problem. Save your money and buy some thing else
I honestly don't see why people would give this camera less than 4 stars. The moment I got it, I was delighted with the quality of the pictures (except in very dark places - which is why the review gets minus 1 star), and by its portability. ---  --- I've dropped it, abused it, took it to countless parties, countries and it is now FULL of scratches and bumps (GET THE CAMERA CASE!), and guess what: it still works as perfectly as the first day I got it. This little piece of technology is amazing, so if you're looking for something affordable and with a great picture quality (for us amateurs, of course) just go for it. ACtually, I even took quite a few gorgeous pictures with it. I even love it and rely on it so much that I won't change it even now that it looks all messed up. ---  --- Don't think twice. Just go for it
Though not bleeding edge, CA gives a good overview of what's happening in the field now.  Only complaint is that the Annuals sometimes seem to be in a rut with similar or same folks featured again and again
Ahh, the Tekken series. Probably the most influential series of 3D fighting games outside of the Virtua Fighter games. Tekken 5 is a welcome return to form for this true master of the genre. With the 4th game just a distance memory, this takes the series forward (or back, depending on how you look at things). Tekken 5 uses the tried and trusted Tekken gameplay, while still making everything feel fresh. Characters, that once before were just mere clones of certain main ones, are now fully fleshed out - with moves of their own. Anna Williams for example, is now not a clone of her sister Nina.  ---  --- When people mention Tekken, they usually think of people who have mastered every single command and move, while spending hours upon hours practising to hone their 'mad skillz' - as it were. Making the game unplayable for beginners to the genre. This, I think, is far from the truth. Tekken 5 welcomes new and veterans to the series alike. Whereas button-bashing pretenders to Tekken's crown, coughDeadorAlivecough, leave you feeling somewhat cold. Tekken on the other hand leaves you feeling a great sense of satisfaction when you play. Yes, Tekken 5 has its button-bashing characters - but every single character IS unique... and how unique they look! Arguably the best looking PS2 game to date. With gorgeous backdrops, fluid, realistic animation and textures that would look at home on any next-gen console. ---  --- Music wise, it's back to form mix between techno/dance we've come to know and love from Tekken. The least we say about Tekken 4's music the better! You've got your usual Story mode to run through with each character. To see why they've entered the tournament, etc. But this 5th edition borrows the human AI mode of Virtua Fighter 4. This has replaced the Arcade mode in name, and pits you against humans who have uploaded/downloaded their data from the Tekken arcade machine from all over the world. It's a welcome challenge, even though it doesn't even compare to facing a real-life human opponent. All-in-all, this is the true homecoming of a master. Easily the best Tekken to date, and probably the best 3D fighter in existence. Though I am partial to abit of Soul Calibur... heh
I wanted to try a new lipgloss because all of the colored ones that I have are horrificly sticky and if they aren't sticky they do not stay on for long.  This one however, manages to combine my love for lipgloss with all the needs of a chapstick.  The color (apple a day) was intimidating looking in the tube but looks perfectly on and doesn't go anywhere.  It also has NO STICKYNESS!  YAY!  I love this gloss and is the perfect gloss for all of my needs!
Another nice, inexpensive tool that makes tedious work go much faster and easier
I have used this system for 9 weeks now.  The bottle will leak if you do not tighten the ring enough or correctly - I test shake before I feed and if its wrong I unscrew and reseat the nipple.  My daughter has less gas with these bottles than with the Playtex bottles I tried.  If your child gags as one reviewer commented you need a slower nipple.  I use the standard nipples and not the adjustable flow nipples.  I have the adapter system that allows me to pump into the bottle and I like the convenience of being able to cap that bottle when done and refrigerator it until feeding time.  These bottles do well in the dishwasher and clean up easily
Listening to this cd took me back to my growing-up years.  I remembered all their songs I loved back then.  It's a great homecoming
I've tried 15-20 different k-cups and would rate Timothy's Parisian Night (can you say French Roast) in the top third.  At the 7.25 oz setting it makes a full-bodied, dark brew with a nutty, almost earthy taste.  It's very much a European-style blend, and with a dash of half and half makes a passable Viennese 'brauner.
I recently bought these 4 little Dora dolls for my 4 yr old's birthday.  She really loves them.  She plays with them all the time.  It is a nice collection to her Dora stash! 
The quality or this product outshines most outdoor wicker I have seen at twice the price. The sofa also is very nice and again quality is outstanding. --- I am concerned about delivery of the chairs to complete my collection, as the previous customer has mentioned. Amazon, what is going on? Suppliers need to be more diligent in shipping collections together
Through luck of genetics, I have dark circles. I've had them since as far back as I can remember. No amount of sleep, eat well, or generally good lifestyle choices changed my dark circles.  ---  --- I was pretty hesitant to try it out, since, woah... $95 is a lot of money, but I gave it a shot. I used it exactly per the instructions. ---  --- I was actually pretty discouraged because I didn't see a change, but then BAM, in the 3rd week of using it, I woke up and my circles were soooo much noticably lighter. I could cry. It's hard being so young and having dark circles under your eyes, but now I  look more my age. And I'm still only in the 3rd week, so I have a lot of hope for the product.  ---  --- I feel badly for the people who didn't get a reaction, but as they state in their pamphlet, it will not work on 100% of people. Like anything, really, won't work for 100% of people.  ---  --- But it worked for me, and I'm so very happy. I would have paid sooo much more for these results.
I have had this winder for about a month now and I am very happy with it. The major convenience is the well-engineered slots and iserts holding watches that are of a very good quality. The inserts are holding watches steadily which contributes to proper winding. All previous more expensive winders with cushion type inserts were falling out (with watches!)and eventually were rendered useless. Highly recommended unit
House 1 is darker than it's sequels but stll maintains the horror/comedy feel throughout.   ---  --- Don't expect to be blown away by outlandish Hollywood special effects. The majority of the special effects are not special.  But if you can get over that, you'll enjoy the movie. ---  --- DVD is pretty bare bones with no amazing special features. I doubt much of that was available due to the age of the film. I'm just happy it was released on DVD! ---  --- If you are a fan of low budget horror/comedy movies this movie may appeal to you. It's no Evil Dead, but it is an entertaining movie. 
This magazine really fills the voids that design school leaves behind.  I have developed some serious guts in fighting for what I am worth due to this publication.  When you are a new designer, you get taken advantage of  frequently.  College did not prepare me to stand up for myself in this competitive market, and this magazine not only keeps you up-to-date with the latest in the design realm, but also serves as a gutsy, motivational read as well.  This is a must have subscription for budding designers. What a relief to read a killer design publication from the midwest
what a crock of ****. the only good thing is that it still has the story with tommy and thats it,,, the kills suck, the plot sucks,acting really sucks, and damnit no jason
Purchased these for my sons lunch box, and can't do it, they are too salty. He's always been happy with Veggy booty, and that is what he'll continue to get
The product broke the first day I used it. I'm going to have to be more careful. I think they are all cheep.
This album is hard! E-40 always come sic wit it. If you don't got it, ya betta git it. It reminds me of his (my fav.)"I a major way" album. Sluppin' from intro till outro. He is the bay area's finnest. Please belave it
I purchased the canon powershot s500 digital elph last March. I kept getting blurry pictures so I called Canon technical support. They went through the whole procedure to make sure my camera was all set up. Well I followed their directions but everything was the way it should have been. So they said I should send it in because there was obviously a problem with it. Then I sent it in and had to pay for the shipping there. They sent it back and said they had switched out some optical thing. Well I just finally went to get my pictures developed and they all have the same problem. They never fixed the problem. Mind you this was the approximately 9 months of my son's life before the age of 2. I called tech support and ended up having to wait more than 24 hours for a call back from a supervisor. She said they would send me pre paid envelope to check out the camera. Well I was greatful and had to tell her that during babysitting in late August a little boy had dropped my camera so there was damage to the outside part of the camera, but it did not effect the quality of the pictures because they were the same as prior to the day it was dropped. She said that they would probably not cover it due to the fact that it might have been caused by the dropped camera. I told I have proof of when it happened and that the pictures prior to that date are coming in blurry just like it was before I sent it in the first time. I started to cry that my son's 9 months are all ruined and she was practically laughing when I got off the phone. The camera is worse than a disposable camera. Don't waste your time or money on this piece of junk. I recommend Olympus. My Olympus prior to this was only 3 megapixels and was better quality than this piece of junk. I am planning on contacting the Better Business Bureau regarding this matter. Please don't waste your time on this, like I have to! I hope this helps people make better choices! Good luck! I wish someone could have forecasted this for me
I purchased this mouse 5 months ago and it has been total frustration ever since. The buttons on the sides are not easy to access or use. But most frustrating is the way the two main buttons perform. When I clicked on them they end up double clicking which caused a lot of problems with retrieving my email messages. I know some may be thinking I haven't configured the settings correctly but I went over it several times and couldn't get it to work right.  What's even more frustrating is the support at Razer is non-existent. They never responded to my email questions which I submitted several times before giving up. I ended up buying a Wacom Intuos 3 tablet which works amazingly well and gives me so much more. I am a commercial illustrator so it is the perfect mouse/pen tool for my needs.  ---  --- Don't buy this product. I would have given it a negative 5 stars if that were an option. At $43.65, it's a steep price to pay for the frustration and a complete waste of time and money
Very interesting spoof of the original game.  I found the first one boring after a few plays, but this one still interests my kids and I after 10+ plays.  It's a bit convoluted to put it together initially, but well worth it
T.J. is a great learning tool for children.  All the stories have been wonderful lessons for children as well as helping them to read
Our 2-year-old loves Thomas the Train, so this was a great gift for her. She has other Thomas items, but they're limited to playtime. This, however, is not only good for playtime, but safe enough for her to take to bed with her (she even kicked her Elmo out to make room for Thomas!). It's also small enough for her to be able to take on car rides. A great all around item to have if you've got a child that's really into Thomas
It is really just one poker player interviewing a bunch of other poker players - and it is not very well done.  There are a couple of good tips, but nothing I have not read elsewhere.  Save your money.  If you are a beginner, and want to learn how to play hold'em, check out Howard Lederer's 'Secrets of No Limit Hold'em' (DVD) and Phil Hellmuth's 'Play Poker Like the Pros' (book), more advanced players should check out David Sklansky's books
I love this chair, and so does my 6 month old.  It's super easy to clean, to recline the seat, or to adjust the height.  The toy that comes with it is cute, too - I love the music it plays
My kids (4.5 and 1) love this car. The sounds it makes are great. They take turns riding on it and the other one pushing. It is quite durable and they play with it all the time. Only negative is that some of the stickers peeled off. Overall, it's a great toy and the kids play with it every day
My husband and I love getting our monthly subscription. We read it to each other in the bath tub and get all hot and bothered. We often talk about the stories inside and discuss our interest in the fantasies we've read about. Variations has definitely led us to try a lot of fun things together. ---  --- If you find yourself interested in trying some of the things you are reading about in this mag, check out Intense Games DVD, it is an adult party game that makes fantasies reality. Really
This magazine is totally awesome. from the excellent software on the disk, to the FREAKIN-AWESOME reviews, to the silly humor and funny letters on the back pages, this magazine is for any mac user who want's more than the professional MacWorld can give ---  --- Projecting humor into a computer magazine is not something many editors can do, bu Rik Myslewski (spelling?) does a great job. I totally recommend it
I've used version 2003 and enjoyed it thoroughly.  I primarily used it for school with different classes and notes for each.  What was great is that is consolidates everything in a way that makes it easy to retrieve your notes. It also makes it easy to generate reports based on the tagging feature.  The tags allow you to highlight and gather key points of information that make writing papers a breeze.  When working with paper, this was not always an easy task to take on. ---  --- Several weeks ago, I downloaded the trial version of OneNote 2007.  The improvements are rather subtle, but powerful.  It didn't take anything to get comfortable with the new features.  After a short time with the trial version I just purchased it because it was so much fun.  ---  --- Here are some of the beneficial features: ---  --- -Like a paper notebook you have sections, but with OneNote 2007 you can have as many sections as you like. ---  --- -You can easily link pages to Outlook. I have linked appointments to a series of notes and support files for various projects and meetings. It makes being organized for a meeting a breeze. ---  --- -Also, it's a great way to archive emails in a way that allows you to see them and organize them as you wish.  You can empty your in box and at the same time keep a record of important emails.  Well worth your time. ---  --- -It is also tablet friendly if you use a tablet PC like I do.  I love it for that use.  There is a fantastic text recognition feature that works EXTREMELY well. If you use a tablet, this is a great feature. ---  --- -As was with the earlier version, you can add voice content to your notes. That's right, voice recorded messages can be added to your notes.  Too cool. ---  --- Before you buy, you might want to go to the Microsoft site and download the trial version.  You'll be able to assess for yourself.  I think you'll be pleased.  I fond it to be one of the best products for 'electronic file keeping' that I've used.  For the price, it's not a bad deal.
Billy Elliot is an 11 year old who does poorly in the boxing ring but surprisingly well in ballet class (meeting with the boxers because of building shuffling needed during a coal miners strike). ---  --- This is the classic "family doesn't initially understand," "teacher believes in him," "screws up audition but spirit carries him through" type movie.  It's put together quite nicely, and you never really know how it is going to turn out. ---  --- The transition from ballet dancing to tap/jazz seemed to happen in one day, which seemed jarring. ---  --- The beginning of Swan Lake, with Billy as the lead and family and friends in attendance, 10 years or so later, was a real "feel good" part of the movie
Don't listen to all that crap about how you should get Linux or buy a Mac instead of buying Windows. That will probably be the dumbest choice in your life. This is the full version of windows OEM software. Comes with activation code and Vista upgrade coupon to either Vista Home Basic or Home Premium. Bought from Tiger Direct through amazon. --- 
Buyer beware. These new Journey releases are reissues of their 1996 remastered releases. They are NOT remastered in 2006. Rhino should be ashamed of itself for this (it's been 10 years - I would have gladly paid for a remastered version, but not for new packaging)
Great movie - there isn't anything I can say that hasn't been said 100 times. 
While the product works it's good.  It was capabable of trimming eyebrows, sideburns, beards & mustaches, and that pesty stray nosehair.  The problem with the MicroTouch is that the motor works for about 6 months and then it is useless.  It is not worth the money. Buy a product that costs more money and is better quality.
It fits our Baby Trend car seat, hooks easily to the LATCH anchor points, and in our mid-size sedan, leaves enough room in the back seat for an adult to sit on each side
Okay, I will admit to liking Poor Tom, Bonzo's whatever (it sure beats Moby Dick!) and Wearing and Tearing, but other than that this is a collection of outtakes that should've stayed outtakes. Low points include We're Gonna Groove, the live I Can't Quit You Baby, Walter's Walk and Ozone Baby. It's a shame that Traveling Riverside Blues and Hey Hey, What Can I Do were left off this album, and included only in the boxed set reissue - it's the only place you can find Hey Hey, What Can I Do, one of my favorite Zeppelin songs, and with Riverside Blues, you have a choice: Shell out $100 to get it, or sit through the crappy BBC Sessions album. If you're obsessed with the band, I guess this would be good for you. But the best version of Coda is in the aforementioned $100 boxed set.
I couldn't resist the very feminine and retro look of the packaging. And it does look cute in the bathroom. That being said this is great to add a layer of sheen to the legs. Your calves look great without stockings. I find it too waxy to use on the rest of the body but there's nothing better on bare legs. To add a glow to the skin, especially to a tan, try Benefit's Flamingo Fancy
i haven't seen this movie in years so when i saw it at block- --- busters i had to rent it. my favorite part is when tom essex --- played by the handsome dana ashbrook put a screwdriver threw the --- head and the head said "get that damn screwdriver out of my head" i couldn't stop laughing it was so funny. i never really liked many horror-comedy movies but this one is really good. --- the best actor in this movie was dana ashbrook, he was not only --- funny but he was very brave and sexy to boot. --- if not many people liked this movie at lease watch it for his performance because he was amazing. he makes me want to watch it --- over and over and over again
I bought this pump because it did have a hard plastic breast shield.  I had a double electric breast pump from first years that was soft plastic shields and I wasn't able to get a drop out because the shields didn't stay in place.  if you have biggre breasts I would suggest using this pump
After reading the other reviews of this product, I felt confident enough to go ahead and buy it as a gift for an 8 year old boy. He is learning multiplication tables now, so I figured this was a great present.  ---  --- Unfortunately, once the batteries were in, it kept malfunctioning and when the dials were twisted to 2 numbers, it would read out two totally different numbers and give their result instead of the 2 numbers the dials showed. We tried over and over to get it to work, but it is a DUD! ---  --- I live overseas so returning it is not an option I am willing to pay the extra freight/duty for. I bought another Leap Frog product at the same time that I have not given as a present yet, I really hope it works
Logic problems really helped me prepare for college. Many of my courses required critical thinking and writing. When I first started doing logic problems, I was terrible! They were so hard, but as I practiced, I became adept at solving these problems. I thought of them as "mental push-ups". The effort was worth it! I graduated magna cum laude
I was really looking forward to these pods based on the reviews.  Starbucks is good, but I prefer bolder taste.... imagine my surprise when I ordered 2 boxes - both were expired! One expired back in 2005 for gosh sakes.  I admit that Amazon agreed to credit me for cost plus part of shipping, but geez, 2 years expired!!!  I'm hoping to find local San Diego area shoppe that carries pods so that I can try something different than starbucks
I've recently swapped from sitting at a desk (which I have done for nearly 20 years) to working at a "stand-up" desk. I found that standing on office carpets, even while wearing comfortable shoes, was tough - I would barely last 5 to 10 minutes. And the accumulative effects were enough that I doubted I would get acclimatized anytime soon. ---  --- Having tried this mat for a week now, I found that I can stand on it for 20 minutes or more at a time straight away. And even at the end of the 20 minutes my feet don't feel bad - I am just sitting at that point because I am sick of standing, not because I have to sit. ---  --- Rather than move the mat out of the way, I am allowing my chair to roll over it. It is not conducive to rolling (being a high chair I don't have the leverage to move it much even on the normal carpet - on the mat I have no hope). When I move the chair away, I can see definite indents in the mat where the wheels were, however these spring back within 5 minutes or so. ---  --- This has been an excellent purchase as far as I am concerned
Feeding the cat...those girls shold put on a sweater. Love this movie, 50's detective noir set in 70's California. The beach, the hospital, Mexico, the supermarket, it's all great - and the theme song keeps going throughout over and over. Final scene pays homage to The Third Man, beautiful. A bit of violence, but "That's how I treat someone I love, and I don't even like you". Never seen an Elliot Gould movie I like more than this, & it's my favorite Altman as well
Ms. Melua is from Georgia.  Her voice is quite like the Swede, Lisa Ekdahl.  Neither has range or power; both have a little girl voice and plenty of finesse.  Both have musical partners.  In Ms. Melua's case it is Mike Batt who is to her what Nelson Riddle was to Linda Rondstadt, except that, in addition to arranging and conducting and coaching, he writes songs.  Most of this album are her and/or his songs.  They are well written and well treated.  They are are a careful team abnd do not cut corners.  Mr. Batt, among many other things, worked with Steeleye Span and Art Garfunkel long ago. ---  --- The original sogs are interesting and liquid pleasant in rendition.  But my favorite cut is her rendering "Blues in the Night", which some might remember from Looney Tunes cartoons many decades past; "My mama done tole me..." it starts.  Knowing she cannot belt it, instead she works it. ---  --- One short note on Steve Sale's engineering because another reviewer was crabbing about reverb and above all, clipping.  Perhaps because I bought it on vinyl, but I hear none of these defects.  My set is revealing, and it reveals excellent engineering, considering the largeish ensemble Mr. Batt has assembeled.  Fear not, unless the CD really is badly made
This card works exactly as stated by StarTech. I bought two - one for a PC and one for a Mac, popped 'em in and plugged in iPods, external hardrives, a scanner, and digital cameras and the cards worked perfectly. The PC needed a quick setup and the Mac worked instantly! ---  --- And all at a great price! ---  --- Can't figger out why you guys are having trouble
this gun is awsome it is the best gun you will ever get for such a good price and guns that are 10 20 or even 30 dollars more the gun is very very light and looks great you can take of the front  and the arm rest to make it look like as machine gun or something scope is great and is a super accurate gun i have shot a can down from farther than 40 feet (one shot) the laser is not super good and hard to use but it comes seperate so you can put it on or take it of whenever a bb might ratle around in their once in a while but it will fall out over all greatest gun ever!!
...yes, the Beatles by which I'm not comparing Supergrass to them. No, Supergrass are riding the road built by not only The Beatles, but other British rock'n'roll greats like The Kinks, David Bowie, The Zombies and many others. But the exploding energy of Supergrass delivers a deeply satisfying listen that does not exist as frequently in the present 2000's. This will definitely be a group that will represent the virtouso side of British rock'n'roll of the 1990's and 2000's, and without doubt represent the Bohemia-Intellectual-Hard Rocking spark that has lighten recent generations that has been going on since Circa-Sgt. Pepper. An intoxicating and highly addictive album. 100% recommended for anyone any age.
This movie is watchable, but barely. Its not on the same level of the other chainsaw versions....and see leatherface as a....never mind, youll --- have to see for yourselves. We have a yound Renee Zellweger in this one. 
This pail does not need special plastic bags--you can use leftover grocery bags, etc., which is a big advantage. I don't know why people buy those diaper pails that individually wraps every dirty diaper--a baby's poop does not smell bad!
So Far, So Good...So What! (in it's origional form) used to conjure feeling.  The remastered edition sounds like a group of studio musicians tried to remake the album and just didn't quite hit the nail on the head.  If you bought this album on cassette when it came out in the late 80s, get your hands on that version. 
Received the bike in our office as a possible incentive for our wellness program and no one was able to use it.  You can't get it to pedal.  The cheaper way is not the way to go on this type of bike.  You need a heavier base and very smooth cycling.  This model runs on a fabric type band on the inside. MADE VERY CHEAP.  I DON'T RECOMMEND
... with both the basic fence 5-piece HearthGate system and a great fit with the decor of our home.  Highly recommend the entire system.  Kare
Oh dear. This is another book like the horrible "Who Moved My Cheese?" that attempts to manipulate grown adults by treating them like children. ---  --- Like the aforementioned "Who thinks my cheese stinks?" (or whatever it is called), I saw some people in the organisation where I work trying to sneakily weave it into the corporate culture and it lasted about five days. ---  --- It's all about making work "FUN". Yep, work can be "FUN". Tell that to the folks who work in hospital waste disposal. Or maybe those who deal with animal cruelty cases. ---  --- Of course, it's just great "FUN" to deal with children who have just had their parents killed, or folks who just lost their kids. ---  --- Because that's what work is - "FUN" - or so this book would have you believe you can convince your workers. ---  --- Of course in the examples I have listed above, it doesn't really work too well, because this is really about getting people in perceived lower-end occupations like factories or call-centres to believe their mind-numbing daily tasks can be "FUN". ---  --- Myself, I do have some "FUN" at work, but probably like many people with more than one brain cell, it is based on having a laugh with my co-workers about the sheer absurdity of where our work life often takes us. ---  --- You can call this cynicism, which is probably how it would be viewed by people who buy into this dumb "Fish"-style "WORK MUST BE FUN" philosophy. I'd call it black humour, but it keeps people sane and makes difficult work more bearable. ---  --- As to the title of my review - this method of making the workplace "FUN" in a forced way is very useful if you have employees that you wish to isolate and marginalise. ---  --- First immerse people in the cult-like atmosphere and tell them that they are now to regard work as "FUN". ---  --- Second, let them know that they now "CHOOSE" their attitude - if they are unhappy in any way (regardless of them doing their work well or not), they are "LETTING THE TEAM DOWN" and not complying with the obligation to "MAKE WORK FUN". ---  --- Third, while the majority of victims or workers, however you choose to view your prey, swallow the "WORK IS FUN" message and display the behaviour of sea lions clapping to get a mouthful of FISH, you can point to those who have shown a small streak of individual identity and are not HAVING FUN AT WORK and use the Enron-style message that they "just don't get it". ---  --- In this way, the resistant individual can be said to be "incompatible with our mission and values", "bad for morale" or just "out of step". ---  --- In this way, the "FUN-LOVING" workers, who have now taken on the costume of "FORCED FALSE FUN" can be set against them. ---  --- Of course this will compound their unhappiness and isolate them further until they are totally marginalised and can be tossed on the scrapheap or forced to resign. ---  --- This book is useful then, if you wish to convince idiots that their "WORK IS FUN". ---  --- Just don't try it on a group of people with a brain between them who might take their work seriously. ---  --- They might tell you to stick your "FISH" where the sun doesn't shine
This is part 2 of a set titled SAY IT RIGHT. The CD has a blue and white style vs. the part 1 that has a yellow and white style on disc and cover. Also in a slim-line jewel case with the title track, non-album track, but an added dance remix plus video. If you enjoyed the first 2-track CD then this is a must. Dance lovers will definitely find this to be a totally spectacular production. ---  --- SAY IT RIGHT [Radio Edit] has the catchy dance beats, nice vocals, excellent drums, and chorus. The lyrics are fun to sing along and strong in meaning. Apparently, it's about not giving a lover power to control, destroy, or make you loose sleep. The melody has great rhythm, chorus, dance styles, and energetic beats. "You don't mean nothing at all to me" is repeated showing a strong message that life doesn't end with someone who isn't right.  ---  --- WHAT I WANTED brings Nelly to a slower tempo displaying depth of emotion. It's a slow ballad with true sincerity and humility. It's about going for something you wanted but never got. The outcome doesn't matter because the reality is you gave it your all. As she sings about her dream and what she wanted it's apparent love can be hard to let go yet comforting to do so. The melody is soothing, pleasant in sound, and refreshing for the soul.  ---  --- SAY IT RIGHT [Peter Rauhofer Remix Part 1] is a hot club remix sure to get you dancing off your feet. The song takes a dive to faster paced trance like effects, different introduction, pumping jamming dance styles with techno flairs, up and down tempos as well as plenty of percussion and synthesizers. Straying from the original song the vocals are still vastly heard yet filled with echoes, swirls of sounds, and much club ambiance. It's dreamy, fantasy filled, and definitely highly paced for the dance floor. If anything is certain it is this: The Remix in this CD is much better than many of her past singles. There is true DJ styles incorporation more instrumentations, effects, and vast production much more geared to club hoppers and dance fans. Quite sticky, infectious, and groove like this remix will get you dancing up a storm feeling like wanting to shake your body non-stop. Club lovers don't pass this out. Nelly's vocals are echoed often and electronic-a effects are vastly hard.  ---  --- SAY IT RIGHT VIDEO [Enhanced CD] is the video many have already seen as Timbaland and Nelly dance face to face and get very close as the message behind the music is reinforced. This is an excellent video with much dance styles, highly energetic beats, and flairs for control and getting the message across. ---  --- Overall, from all of Nelly's singles I find this to be on the top of my favorite. The combination of 2 highly emotional yet different songs plus a dance track and video makes this remarkable. Definitely buy this if you are a Nelly fan, club hopper, or a lover of music to enjoy for the depth of emotion, different styles displayed, and the themes. It's definitely a top sensation. Before it sells out be sure to buy it. The part 1 is also an excellent addition for those days you don't want to listen to the remix. This is highly recommended for sure!
this software is useless.  it is a slow and a system resource hog.  you can download dozens of free apps that do a better job than this for free
Very classy scent. Very strong. Spray sparingly, a little goes a long way. Lasts all day. Will receive many compliments
This is the very BEST hairstyler and hair dryer in one! I have very fine, thick, shoulder lenght hair and was a little skeptical that this product would be usefull for me. It is! Actually it is the best hair styling product I have ever purchased. It dries and sets my hair very quickly, usually in five minutes or less. What a timesaver. I am so delighted with this product that I purchased eight (8) to keep in my closet so I don't have to hunt for the best product EVER!!!
I use an i-Pod mini in my car.  It is in the center console where it connects to the auxillary input.  I used to have to open the console to make changes or turn it on or off.  The air click allows me to do all of that with the remote that I leave in a tray outside the console.  It works just as it is supposed to with no problems at all.  It solved my problem and I am a very satisfied customer. 
Poor quality product. --- The product is two rigid pieces of plastic. --- A slight warpage of back piece of my plastic case made  --- it impossible to fit my chocolate phone.   --- You won't know if your case will fit until you try to put it on!!! --- You're taking a chance if you buy this produc
This is the best business and money magazine out there. They cover everything thought you needed to know and everything you didn't think of.
Ah, the men's magazine. So many out there, where to draw the line when it comes to subscribing? Ultimately it boils down to what is worth the money you are shelling out, and for me, FHM is a cut above the rest for the following reasons. ---  --- 1. Articles are more intelligently written, less sophmoric, and delve on a wider array of issues. ---  --- 2. Paper quality is high glossy and sturdy, while other magazines feel like cheap pieces of newspaper by comparison. Paper feels like the same paper used by Playboy. ---  --- 3. Quality of women featured. FHM has by far a higher quality of women. Maxim tends to pull from a rung lower on the quality ladder, while FHM features beautiful, sexy, intelligent, and funny women whose interviews are actually readable. ---  --- 4. FHM Top 100 Women Special. Wow. Worth the money right there. ---  --- [...] --- Only negative with subscriptions is that these companies will send you last month's issue and count that as one of your 12 issues. That is annoying
This is one of the best watches available and I have no regrets whatsoever with my purchase at a real bargain price from Amazon
My mouth dropped when i received this item.  the inside is like raw material and the piece that holds the money down is not easy to use.  For clarity it has 2 outside pockets and no inside pockets
We've only had ours a week and I wish we'd bought it sooner.  The photos are sharp and every bit as good as commercially printed ones.  I like it that they are dry and can be handled right away unlike my big HP printer's photos which stay sticky for some time. --- Having this gives such freedom to print and print photos to enclose in letters, to use in scrapbooking, and to frame for your home or for gifts.  Really convenient and takes very little space on the desktop
These earphones are incredible! They are comprised of excellent bass and treble. You experience everything much nicely. These earphones compared to the iPod headphones are excellent unlike those raggety things. I bought these from ebay for $8 and for that amount of price, you can't regret buying these sensational earphones
I really wanted to give Superman Volume 3 a full 5 stars, but unfortunately the quality control of the DVD release is poor, hence the 1 star rating.  The DVD set I purchased skipped at the Green Lantern episode.  The replacement I got also skipped at the same place.  In addition, the two-sided disc format with which all three DVD volumes have been released is a damage prone format.  Luckily I was able to get a full refund, but at this point I'm not sure if or when I'll try my chance at buying this set again.   ---  --- The lack of quality control is too bad, because Volume 3 contains some of the best episodes of the whole series.  If you are fortunate enough to get a DVD set free of defects, then you are really in for a treat.  Bruce Timm and company bring the same high level of storytelling to Superman as they did on Batman: The Animated Series.  Of particular note is an ongoing subplot involving the villain Darkseid throughout the series.  It finally gets put front and center in several episodes of Volume 3, and leads straight to the very powerful and dramatic series finale.  I felt that the finale could have been written out across three episodes instead of two due to the scale of the story, but nevertheless it is a great ending for a great series
I found Cat Fancy Magazine to be mostly advertisements and breeders advertisements than real meat of information for cat owners.  I'm also very unimpressed with their Cat Channel online board they advertise in Cat Fancy and cannot recommend it to others.  They seem to have poor management of their online board especially on weekends so inappropriate posts stay there for a long time and a professional magazine advertising their own online board in their magazine should have their online board perfected before offering it.  Also Cat Fancy pushes a ridiculous high renewal rate for their magazine, but if you go onto Amazon, you can get a renewal rate of almost half the Cat Fancy renewal price.  So I have come to the conclusion that between the Cat Fancy magazine, their poor online Cat Channel board and the high renewal rate Cat Fancy charges, they are not interested in keeping their readers or online members. 
This book is as close to perfect as you can get. I personally like magical realism and also wanted to learn more about the recent history of India. ---  --- Worth noting, the Mistry book, A Fine Balance, while good, is basically a full on rip off of this book. If you want the original, read Rushdie. Mistry should be ashamed. His is not even a different take, it is just another take of the same image and not as good
I was shocked at the different sounds this thing makes. After just a few minutes the chorus sound was totall amazing, like a nice fluid bright 12 string, totally a cool toy for $10
I bought these for my daughter thinking that maybe they wouldn't leak like the last ones I had used.  They don't leak, but the stage 1 is TOO slow and frustrates her.  She's 5 months and the stage 2 is TOO fast.  They made a HUGE mistake in not making more stages.  Had I realized this before I had used them, I would have taken them all back
It's a bad idea to create a character-driven sci-fi when your characters are this annoying.  The majority of Children of the Mind consists of inane dialogue between characters that are impossible to care about.  The characters are so one-dimensional and predictable that you already know what they'll say before they say it.  Peter says nothing except smart alecky remarks, Val spends the whole book whining loudly about not being a real person, Novinha is as crazy and hard-headed as she's been for the last two books, and Ender spouts off a bunch of trite, up-with-people garbage every chance he gets.  Somehow, Card even managed to make Jane more irritating than my ex-girlfriend during PMS.  The only decent characters in this book are Miro and Wang Mu, and they aren't nearly enough to save the story. ---  --- I admit it: I only made it a little over half-way through Children of the Mind.  I couldn't take the dialogue anymore.  That's not to mention the ridiculous plot, which centers on two children warping around the universe, engaging in philosophical discussions with caricatures of Japanese and Polynesian culture, in an attempt to avert a war between species. ---  --- If you're that curious to learn how the Ender Quartet concludes, do what I should've done from the beginning: find a plot synopsis somewhere and save yourself the pain of reading this garbage
Reinventing the Bazaar used real-life examples to make markets understandable to any reader.  From pharmaceutical companies to the Tokyo fish market, McMillan brings markets alive right in front of the readers' eyes.  He attempts to demystify the mystery behind markets, and in my opinion, he succeeds.  Each chapter presents a new market setting which McMillan uses to illustrate his various points.  While the book has an economic undertone, the level of writing is not above the understanding of even a high school student.  All terminology is explained not only with words, but with examples, as well.  The book was enjoyable, especially if you have little familiarity with various market settings.  However, I would encourage anyone to read this book because even the experts on markets will have their knowledge enriched by this book
This is a very useful item. It looks great and holds a lot of stuff. You can also carry it around from room to room
I just saw this move for the first time in wide screen and it is a much different experience I must say. I think I have figured it out. In some other reviews I think Batricia Birch should have just stayed with the songs and the numbers. I think they should have got another director to get the rest of the movie off the ground. It is somewhat of a good story. I can see why it would be reversed (a guy trying to get the girl, instead of the other way around). You see Eugine in the beginning of the movie stumbling out of the bus. Well if he were a senior in the first one then why is he in the second one???? Also Frenchie is not with the Pink Ladies at all. You see her by herself or just briefly with the other pink ladies in school. I think the chemistry between Stephanie and Michael were worked well together. The songs were written by the same people that wrote the songs for the first movie. So really the bottom line is that they should have gotten a different director altogether. I know I know it is not the first one. But sequels are usually not, but they usually have connections to the first. Grease 2 tried to accomplish with Frenchie and the Tbirds, Pink ladies and all. I am glad they were able to have Eve Arden, Sid Ceaser, plus other great actors of the 50s and 60s like Tab Hunter. Is this movie cheesy???? Yes  --- Is it done in less than expected direction???? Yes. Does it have good songs??  Yes (Cool Rider, Reproduction, We'll Always be Together, Girl for all Seasons/Turn Back, and Back to School). The song skits themselves are good and with the same flavor of the first one. After all Kiddies, Patricia Birch did do the choreography for both.  --- So, in closing, this movie made it to my DVD collection if for that reason alone. If Grease 2 is going to stink then let it reek. If it has its moments of good cute fun then let it have that. I think if you loved the first Grease then I think you should at least give this one a try.     
I have had it since October and it is clearly the best phone I have ever owned.  It has also replaced my camera, and I am now never without a camera. ---  --- I attend a lot of concerts where cameras are almost always prohibited.  They don't give the phone a second glance, not realizing it's got the 3.2 megapixel capability.  I have got tons of fantastic shots from the last 4 shows. ---  --- After throwing in a 1GB memory stick (I think it was $79?) it is now storing a half gig of my best music and the display says it will hold 300+ pics right now. ---  --- The movie function rocks too, however you are going to want to be up very close to the subject.  The sound playback of the movies is fantastic though, so at least concert videos make for good listening. ---  --- The phone works flawlessly with my PC.  If I throw it on the USB cable, it pops up instantly as another drive, just like the camera.  Just drag on/off the music and pics.  All pics are very nicely numbered and named. ---  --- If I don't care about viewing the files and just want to move stuff on and off the phone, I don't even take it out of my pocket.  The bluetooth connection allows me to use their software to move things around. ---  --- Also very cool was that it pops up on my computer as a Modem, which I actually was able to use immediately in my PC Anywhere program. ---  --- In terms of being a phone, yeah it's great.  The contact list is easy to work with, the call clarity is no issue at all, good signal, no dropped calls, etc. etc. (this is all with Cingular).  Speaker phone works well. ---  --- It needs charging about every 3rd day, charges very quickly.  Charges slower but with the USB plugged in it also charges.   ---  --- The only thing I can think to complain about is that when using the USB cable to charge, it only wants to charge it to 89%.  If I want 100% I have to throw it on the real charger for a few minutes. --- 
If you are planning on getting a good deck then do not waste your time with this..it has the essentials, sure, but your money is better spent at one of the 4 "STRUCTURE DECKS"!! They are much better than this..I can say so beacuse my sis owns this deck and I can beat her every time :) Konami needs to put some better stuff in this deck - like Senju of the Thousand Hands X 2. Also they need to take away the change of heart since it's "advanced" forbidden. but still, this deck deserves an OK rating since it has all the essentials..this is no better than the first yugi starter deck. So if you ALREADY have a starter deck, do not get this as it is not worth it - a lot of weak non effect monsters.
I loved it and guys really love it.  The smell is so fresh and clean. 
Maybe her harp playing could be acceptable, but when she sings... everything turns awful. The worst singer I ever heard
I received a pleasent surprise. The keyboard was shipped sooner than I expected, arrived in perfect condition and works beautifully. I will buy from this vendor again
This is the best ever!!!!!!!! It's so much fun to blend colors. If your planning to get a set, get the EL Grande kit because it's pretty cheap and it's the only set with all 24 pens and all 12 fusion chambers. This is so much fun!!!!!!!
Don't get me wrong...the concept of this toy if fantastic...and when it works it is wonderful....however, it sucks up so many batteries it is not even funny! It requres 4 C batteries and we replace them at LEAST every 3 weeks! Not only that but there is something wrong with the toy that makes it stick in the "on" position even after you turn it off (very loud and sqeaky". V-Tech knows of this problem but tell you when you call to "take the batteries our and turn it off and on 20 times to reset it". Well, that will work a few times but then the toy is totally broken. AND...their idea is for you to send it to them and they will take 2 weesk to send you a replacement....hmm....is this not a toy marketed to help children sleep...so we OBVIOUSLY need it at bedtime! I offered to apy them up front for a new one and they could reimburse me but they would not bend. Needless to say I am QUITE frustrated with V-tech!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If they know it is a problem they should tell you that on the FIRST call so something can be done about it!!! --- Another creepy side note....the thing says "I love you" in some strange voice to your child......SCARY! --- V-Tech has a great idea here and it is the best toy of its type...however, it doesn't work....looks like they came out with the technology a bit too soon! --- BTW...I rated Durability as a 1 and Amazon has it showing as 3 stars...hmmmm!
Magazine was fast to ship, with all of the timeless great advice you would expect from GQ
Tim Russert is a great journalist and this book is a great resource for ideas and suggestions on how to be a better dad.  In fact there is something in this book for everyone no matter what your relationship with your father is or was. The most precious things a father can provide are time, attention, and love.  This book makes the reader sit back and appreciate the little things only you and your dad know. Great work! Keep it up, Tim!  -- I also watch most of Tim's TV programs.
I'm the first to confess that I had never heard any of any of the actors starring in the 1951 Robert Wise gothic noir, The House on Telegraph Hill, but it doesn't matter, because all the actors are good, and combined with an extremely effective plot, the movie is a terrific tale of murder, deceit and assumed identities in post world war San Francisco.  ---  --- As was the fashion with many noir films of the time, The House on Telegraph Hill is told in flashback with a voice over from the heroine. She tells of her house that is empty and is up for sale, and one immediately assumes that something terrible has happened. However, the narrative soon jumps to Germany at the end of the War, and we meet Victoria Kopwelska (Valentina Cortese) is a Polish woman imprisoned in Belsen. ---  --- With her husband and family dead, Victoria tells the kindly American commander Major Marc Bennett (William Lundigan) that there's nothing for her back in Poland. Desperate to survive, Victoria learns that her best friend has family in the United States, and if they are ever freed, she promises to take Victoria to America with her. Her friend however, is killed shortly before American troops can liberate the camp.  ---  --- With nowhere to go, Victoria hatches a scheme to steal her friend's papers and sail to America, where she learns now the godmother to a young boy Chris (Gordon Gebert), as well as the heir to a sizable fortune, and a gorgeously gothic house high atop Telegraph Hill, following the death of her "aunt." Ensconced in the ostensible mansion, Victoria, now dressing in glamorous frocks and drinking expensive champagne marries the boy's guardian Alan Spender (Richard Basehart), partly out of desperation and partly out of the need for security. ---  --- As Victoria becomes a "mother" to the boy, she clashes with his governess Margaret (Fay Baker) and coincidently reconnects with Marc whom she met a Belsen, now a studly a playboy type lawyer.  All the adults are not as they seem: Marc has been making secret plans to get his hands on the money, and Victoria's arrival causes him to draft a new scheme.  Victoria begins to believe that her new sweetheart is up to no good. And then there's the Margaret, the furtive outsider and whether her allegiances to Chris are all they seem.  ---  --- The film is compelling, and tension-fuelled and beautifully shot in black and white. Cortese is especially good in one of her first American roles and as Victoria, she frantically tries to keep up her masquerade, yet through no fault of her own, she steadily becomes a victim of Alan's scheming.  ---  --- Of particular note are the stunning location shots of San Francisco. The main house is just beautiful and the scenes when Victoria is playing baseball with Chris offer stunning views of San Francisco Bay. The House on Telegraph Hill ultimately serves as one of the better noir thrillers - there's a runaway car, poisoned orange juice, an enigmatic and jealous housekeeper and a false identity. It all makes for a gripping and entertaining film.  ---  --- Victoria starts out as a victim, and although she schemes and lies her way into the house on Telegraph Hill, her ability to rise above the nefarious misdeeds enable her to achieve a kind of redemption for both her and Chris.

The newly released double disc edition of "The Towering Inferno", with its enhanced picture and sound, not to mention the additional poignancy of its parallels to 9/11, cements its place in Hollywood history as perhaps the greatest fictional disaster film ever
I covered a similar theme in my international relations MA - whilst any programme made for TV has to be reasonable breif on the subject, I found this to be a very well argued and produced programme. ---  --- I recomend it, not so much as some dark conspiracy, but more a genuine question about large private interest with huge influence in a democratic country. We should question to make sure that what happens in our name, is always in our interest
Epson's 3600 is a "nice" 3 in 1 Printer, Scanner, and Copier, but the Ink Cartridges "SUCK"! This is my third and last Epson Printer. ---  --- Robert H
I found two paperbacks at work, which were both thriller series, both written by women, both having two word titles with the first word being "Blind."  One of the two I found exciting and satisfying, and eagerly read it.  That was not this book. ---  --- At first, I thought it was just me.  Unlike others, I found it easy to get into the book.  But I found it too new age for me.  Between Eve talking to her dead daughter to the creepy Aldo to Jane's connection with the murdered Cira, I decided I didn't need to read the whole novel and checked to make sure Jane and Trevor survived.   ---  --- Maybe this wasn't Iris Johansen's best book.  But I'm not going to be trying any of her others, based on this one
As a classic Seattle tea, this tea brings back memories of hiding away from the rainy weather sipping a delicious naturally sweet cinnamon citrus tea. When I drink this tea, I am home again. This tea has a unique personality that seems to embody the entire mood of Seattle in one cup.  ---  --- This is a delicious tea that should be brewed for at least 5 minutes to bring out all the flavors. You can sweeten this more if you like with Stevia or a natural sugar to enhance the natural sweetness. It is good with a touch of Muscovado Sugar from India Tree or the RIEME French vanilla syrup. ---  --- When I'm writing reviews and I get sleepy, this tea --- wakes me up.   ---  --- ~The Rebecca Review
This is a camera that is very very easy to use. I was amazed by the colour quality even at a very low light. I took a movie at my nephew's theater play and I am the contrasts and crispness of the picture are just perfect. The zoom is also very clear and crisp. Putting it onto my iMovie was also a piece of cake.  --- The only down point is that the still image mode is worthless, but if you need that you should buy the next level up which has a memory card slot. --- I highly recommend this camer
have used these bibs for two kids now, wow do they last, and unlike some bibs, these can go right in the washer and dryer - well worth the money!  Still using them for my messy 3 year old
When Worlds Collide has all the ingredients of a great movie for the year that it was made.  The actors were great.  The story is scary when you start to think that this can happen.  The ending was excellent.  Not a happy ending for mother earth but not all end of the world movies should have the earth been saved.  I bought the movie and seeing it many time and still like it.
This is exactly what I wanted! --- I've had so many slipping problems in my Ashtanga yoga class. Both my hands and feet would slide and it was soooo hard to hold poses. Here is the answer! --- It works great! I'm very happy.
I ordered a 7.5 M which is what I always wear in a shoe.  I couldn't even get my foot into the shoe.  I can tell you that it was way too narrow.  I don't know about the length because my foot wouldn't go in.  I had to return them.  I wouldn't buy another pair of Daniel Green's until I knew for sure how the sizes really run.  0 Stars
This is one of the best beef jerkys  I have purchased, moist, tender, with a great flavor, I have tried the others that are like orginial dry and tough to chew, leaves your jaws tired...also a great price...best I have found...Will order agai
Don't waste your money (even just 10 bucks).  The plastic is not rip-stop and tears very easily.  I will now just use a big, heavy duty, black trash can liner - they are much stronger
Although I have yet to subscribe to Aperture, what I've heard and what little I've seen advertised in one of Sally Mann's famous publications is enough to arouse my interest, and I can't wait to partake of a first issue of 'Aperture'.  Feedback from other members is always anticipated and welcomed
This game was not at all what I expected.  The steering wheel and pedals are just for looks.  You actually have to control the game with arrow buttons on the steering wheel.  And many of the games had nothing to do with driving.  So glad I opened it to try it before Christmas morning.  This is one toy that is headed back to the store
I ordered two of these cots for twin 4-year-old grandsons to use when staying at my home. I expected the cots to be fairly sturdy, perhaps along the line of a porta-crib. Instead, the frame doesn't lock in place and looks like it would bend fairly easily. The twins tried them out -- after being cautioned not to jump on them; the cots didn't look like they would holdup with a little boy rolling around on them. I returned the cots to Target
I bought this band in two strengths. It is advertised as "99.998% free of soluble proteins and latex allergens" and powder free and it is neither. I used them and got a skin reaction to latex which I would not have if it was only .02 % latex. ---  --- Customer service was helpful when I called.
This was my second Netgear product I bought (previously a wireless modem which I was only okay with not impressed)  The idea of a network storage appeals to me.  But this drive just is not good.   ---   --- In reading the previous reviews I found that it was a finicky thing, and be careful on the drives you buy for it.  Well I searched and searched and found a drive that worked and bought both yesterday.  ---   --- Tried to set it up today and connecting the drive went pretty well, but that is where everything started to go down hill.  Midway through the install it tells you to okay any error messages (which turn out to be things like this is untested on XP and might not work kind of errors) and suddenly my computer reboots.  Figured it would have told me it was going to do so oh well, and it never goes back to the install like most programs do when they require a reboot.  Tried again, same thing happens.  Started poking around and find out that not only do you have to check the drive you put in to the SC101, you need to look in to your own computer.  To quote Netgears web site, "SCSI disk drivers from the Promise company conflict with the SC101 device drivers. Promise drivers are typically used for RAID 1 or for SATA drives. Many newer computers use Promise SATA drivers." ---  --- My computer is just a week old and has these newer drivers.  Back in the box the SC101 goes, and I try to uninstall the software as this product will not work for me.  Tried the 3 things when you have trouble it suggests, and none work.  This is where I get really frustrated, Netgear support.  I waited 35 minutes for someone to pick up the phone, who ultimately told me it was my own fault and I'd have to pay to have that "cr*p", yes he said it, from my system.  I needed to hire a local computer vendor and it would be my bill.  I have to pay to get this junk off my computer.  Way to support your products Netgear.  The tech support person who got on the phone had an accent that was hard to understand, and went through huge mood swings during the call, from happy, to argumentative, to depressed, to happy again.  I was freaked that this person knew my home address! ---   --- All in all, this is a great concept.  After reading up on it and now experiencing it, I think it needs a ton more engineering and refinement before it is brought to market.  Maybe by a company with better customer service.  It really requires a level of technical expertise that is not there with the average consumer
I bought it for my Canon S3 IS. First I tried it without formatting and fill it up with photos and video and no problems. Then I did the suggested format by Canon and it worked the same: perfect. Fast enough to cope with the demands of the camera; haven't any problem of corruption.  ---  --- I've been tempted to buy another one. 
I have tried so many products out there to firm up the area under my eyes and nothing has worked.  Initially I was a little skeptical cause of my lack of success with other products.  I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised.  It certainly has improved the look of the skin around my eyes.  It may seem  expensive, but a little goes a very very long way.  Has a nice texture and easily absorbs and not the least big irritating...and I have sensitive skin.  Try it...I don't think you'll be disappointed.  I wasn't
I am so sick of all the fragrances out there that smell like chocolate, pie or cake. Why people want to smell like food puzzles me. That's why I was so glad to find a feminine floral scent with a little tease to it. Maybe Baby is delightful, not too heavy but making its presence known. The complements will flow. It's sweet (not too sweet though) and innocent while at the same time being flirty. If I had to pick a season it reminds me of it would be Spring. I can't describe a frangrance anymore than I can describe a wine but with all the stinkers out there I just had to put in a good word for this very wearable scent.
Battery is way overpriced. Contact Battery Store near you! I did and found this same exact battery type(2-6volt Batteries) for much less. While there they told me I could use a low amp 12v Deep Cycle battery instead. It did take some time wiring (FUSED LINK IS A MUST) but is well worth it. Lasts all day and you can charge it at a 2 amp "trickle charge" with a "amp selectable" car battery charger. All told it cost me less than $60 for everything. It now longer just "Takes Up Space"
Awesome TEA, I highly recommend it. Has a kick to it, spice and orange flavor. Great customer service.
Bought this with the Sean Conway Tiverton 2006 Deep Seating 4-pc. Chair set. Looks and feels great as a set. It was a chance worth taking..
We purchased this carrier for our sons car seat 4 years ago.  For perspective, we are heavy travelers with 4-6 international trips/year and always bring our son's car seat along. This carrier has been indispensable for us. It fits our large Britax Roundabout, plus has space for a bag of diapers, soft toys or the extra shopping from our trips.  We use the back pack or wheels to tote it around airports or onto planes. As our son grew large enought to not need the seat on the plane, we simply check it through as a piece of luggage.  The material is lightweight and we have had a few small tears along the bottom of the bag, but we were able to repair them easily enough by ourselves with needle and thread. We just adopted a second child and bought the same carrier again for her car seat as well
Many words - few practical tips! This book did not give much more (-valuable-) information than I already had found out by reading the manual delivered with my pocket computer.  --- After reading the book I still had to search for web communities, where some of my questions could be answered.  --- My expectations when buying the book were mainly focused on the need for practical hints concerning how to manage tasks, contacts and appointments. Unfortunately, in my view, these important and basic issues were treated too superficially.    
I bought this cd after hearing Tony on one of the am morning shows, and really likings some of his past offerings, but I have to say that this cd was the pits and a waste of my money.  I was ticked off to have bought this cd from a talented brother and not have gotten my money's worth.  Tony has been on the scene for quite a number of years, and I expected a more mature offering from him than this latest.  There is a great lack of maturity on this cd, and it's an overall disappointment.  Unfortunately, I have to say here that Toney is not alone.  What on earth possessed veteran soul singers the O'Jays to sing a song like Let's Ride?  Who are they singing about girls their granddaughters ages?  Hoochie mommas?  What?  Babyface?  Even he gets in on the foolishness of trying to sing like the hip hop crowd!  And what's up with the explicit lyrics?  We all know you can curse like sailors, but why is this language necessary in music?  And I know that artist have always performed their music, but will someone tell me why it's necessary to perform with so few clothes on?  I would rather hear your music, not see your booty! Sorry, but a review I just read triggered me, and I'd been thinking about the Tony Terry cd for a while.  Hope he comes up with a more mature offering the next time.  Meanwhile I think you're safe in skipping this particular cd
This was the only gate on the market that I could find that would fit the 12 foot doorway between my livingroom and dining area. It stated easy to install but when the screws kept breaking off inside my new woodwork and I kept having to redrill holes I was a bit angry!!!! I suggest predrilling your holes!!! The hinges  also won't stay on and the swinging gate doesn't line up. You need 2 hands to close the gate which as a busy mom of 5 children you don't always have 2 hands free! By the end of installing this gate it was about to be throw out
Outstanding product.  Never been so organized and the boxes look great.  I will buy more when these boxes are filled
I bought the Tourmaline hoping to save time, because I have very thick, wavy hair that takes 45 minutes to dry and straighten.  It ended up taking just as long, but the results were much better.  My hair was super straight and shiny, and it didn't get frizzy even in humid weather.  Then when I was using it for just the 4th time, it completely stopped working.  Just as other people described, the red light shut off and it cooled down, and never turned back on.  I'm in the process of trying to get a refund or replacement now. 
For a recently college graduate and moderate sports world observer with little experience negotiating in a business environment, this book was a pleasure to read. The concepts in this book are on or above par with my textbook on negotiation. However, I specifically enjoyed how Steinberg illustrates important concepts with stories involving the ever interesting personalities of professional sports. From establishing values to finalizing the contract, this book is efficiently organized to lead through the negotiation process. Also, at the end of each sub-chapter is a summary of the key points of the reading. Winning with integrity isn't easy in general, let alone in the ruthless world of sports agents. Leigh shares his experiences that have lead to his success in this fun and insightful book
I just got mine from Amazon (after a lengthly delay).  It is an awesome memory card.  It comes with the adapter so that you can use it in digital cameras.  I tested it on the camera and it worked great.  The real test was the compatibility with the SONY PSP.  No issues there.   The card worked flawlessly.  I've already used up 600 MB.....its a must buy! ---  --- Plus, at $99.99, its much less than other retailers.   btw, i ordered it at $104.99, then contacted amazon about the price drop.  They credited the difference to me without any hassle and gave me the one-day shipping at no charge because of the delay.  Overall great service too.
These california grapes are mighty tasty. I eat all the ten grapes. It's good for making wine. It's cheap in the grocery stores cause their on sale
My 8yo dd received this for her bday. She loves it. It has lots of storage space insde for all her Polly Pocket goodies. It's also quite sturdy. One of the levels got bent the wrong way and I was able to put it back and it still works
Why is Dylan taking sole credit on an album featuring a fair percentage of other peoples song writing ?  ---  ---  --- Shame on you Bob
I originally wanted the Black Ginger Aromatic Candle, but after reading the reviews it seemed that the Red Currant is the all around favorite.  The smell is nice, but I think I expected something a bit different.  The candle's scent does travel throughout my home like others have stated, and it seems to be burning slowly.  The candle itself is fine quality, and comes packaged nicely!  If I found a scent that I liked a bit better I would be 100% pleased
This gun was Great. When I got it I immediatly Pulled it out and went to play with it. Good For Kids Just starting out with bb guns. Also It isn't that Powerful. Overall this gun is great and i cant beleive it is $0.0
If you love the scent of the Bathina line, Benefit has finally come out with an eau de toilette with the same scent. I wear this scent everyday and I always get compliments. I love to put the scent in my hair because it lingers in hair longer than skin. Many scents smell different on different skin types, but Maybe Baby is a pretty true scent. I guaruntee you will absolutely love this perfume and so will everyone around you. :
I have only found ONE place to buy probe covers for this thing - so I bought a lot. They aren't the same manufacturer - but they are the exact type of probe covers. Hope this helps others looking for covers for this. If the first years doesn't sell probe covers for this anymore - they shouldn't let companies sell the thermometer either.   ---    ---  http://www.shoplet.com/office/db/g2512530.htm 
I flip through Time every now and again at the barber shop.  Sometimes there are good bits that they are using to keep the interest of people who want progressive social change, people who are sick of the power of the corporate elite and the violence of our militarists.   --- For the most part, since Time receives most of its revenues from Big Business advertisements, it can't challenge the establishment as it needs to. --- So instead I read magazines like Z, Utne, Mother Jones, The Progressive, The Sun, Earth Island and the New Internationalist
This is my favorite starbucks roast, but why dont you just go to your local starbucks to purchase this, its the same price if you just go there and you dont have to pay for shipping and handeling and all that stuff, plus they will grind it for you there
I have a home daycare, so this chair is used constantly. I've had two of these for well over a year, and today I bought a third one. I've tried several different seats in the past and this one is the best by far. Nothing beats the swinging tray. I would recommend it to anyone
I bought this item because of a great price, Amazon shipped it regualr UPS and I received it earlier that expected, the box looked in good shape but when I opened it one of the legs was broken off,I thought at first that it must have taken a pretty good hit to do that, so I called customer service and they sent me a return tag and shipped me a new one right out, I got it, opened it and the exact same thing, box was in good shape but 1 leg was broken, I called customer service and again they shipped another one out, this time second day air. I get the third one and guess what, the exact same thing for the third time! I looked at it carefully and each time it was broken at the weld in two areas on the cooker and it had to have been poor workmanship and quality control, it even looked like it had rusted in one weld! I can't say enough about Amazon's customer service,but I wouldn't reccommend buying the banjo cooker by mail order
After watching the newest version on television, this one didn't measure up. The movie didn't make you want to watch more. There was no romance compared to the latest version
I bought this for the flashlight feature.  You have to press and hold the button in a clumsy way in order to keep the green flashlight on.  Also, the only way to have the clock light up is if you have the alarm on.  The buttons on the front are cheap and don't seem like they'll last very long
I love the size (small) and quality of these earrings that were ordered for my 6 year old.  The website picture shows them as a blue and purple color.  When I got them they were pink and green, even the replacements they sent were pink and green.  I have not been happy with their customer service on these and will not order jewelry again. 
 I thought that this would be an ideal product for my aging father as both his sight and his dexterity are somewhat impaired. My first thought was to contact the parent company, Hy-Tek Manufacturing, to ask for a dealer referral and to get some answers to a few simple operations questions. After 3 days they did get back to me, recommending Amazon as a purchase source but ignoring my request for operations information. I sent a second email but it was completely ignored. Maybe this should have been a warning. ---  ---  I decided to go ahead and order one anyway. The purchasing process was quick and easy and delivery form Amazon's agent was about 5 days, more than acceptable. The unit comes well packaged with easy to follow instructions. Actual programming is simple and very straight forward. The problems started after successfully programming my dad's satellite receiver. The main menu could not be accessed, the information button was non-functional and two of the numeric keys did not work. I tried all of the codes listed for the manufacturer of that receiver, none of them made any difference. ---  ---  Another email to Hy-Tek, and another 3 day wait, produced the response " it doesn't work with all devices and I guess it just won't work with your receiver, you'll have to send it back to the supplier. We will make note of this and maybe we can add this receiver in a future update. " No help at all and no concern or consideration expressed on the part of the manufacturer. If they had bothered to respond to my original inquiry in the first place, I would never have purchased this substandard piece of equipment and wouldn't have been out the freight charges. One of the questions that I asked originally was " will it access the main menu? ", but they didn't have the common courtesy to respond. ---  ---  Be aware that this remote will not work with all devices. Even simple, necessary functions like menu and numbers may not be accessible. The manufacturer is slow to respond to customer inquiries and less than helpful if and when they do. Would I recommend or purchase this item again, absolutely not
I hate to admit, but we have roaches! Actually, we HAD roaches until last week when I purchased this product. I had tried everything: sprays, bombs, traps, etc... But nothing worked. The first day I plugged this little device in, there was such a great increase in bug activity that my kids wouldn't go into the kitchen. By day 3, the roaches were GONE! I don't know where they went, and I don't care. This device saved my sanity
I don't own this clock, but I do own one of it's sister clocks, the Tambour Style Mantel Clock, and it did not change for DST now that the date has changed.  Even though I've owned my clock for all of a month and a half, River City Cuckoo Clocks does not consider this fact to be a defect.  Since I would assume that all their radio controlled clocks have the same electronics, I would be very wary about buying this clock
The "sticky" pads that are supposed to hold the organizer don't even stick, so every morning I would wake up to find the organizer sitting in a pile on the floor next to the changing table...and this was with absolutely NO items in it.  The organizer doesn't come with any information, so I had no idea if there were alternate ways to hang the organizer or not.  This is a great idea, but it is very poorly constructed. 
This toy is a piece of junk. I can't believe Disney actually did any testing whatsoever on this toy. An adult can't even get it to work. The car is supposed to sense the infrared light in front of it and follow, but all it does is jerk forward a teeny bit and then stop. If anything, it senses when the light clicks off and then it jerks forward a little bit. We read the instructions and saw that the car does not work well in bright lighting conditions so we took it down to the dark basement (as if my son should actually be expected to only play with this car in the dark!) but it didn't even work there.  BIG DISAPPOINTMENT on Christmas morning that we had to wait 8 hours for it charge, and then even BIGGER disappointment the next morning when we finally got to play with it and it didn't work. DO NOT BUY THIS TOY
This is my 2nd one. That's just because I dropped the other one on my hard tile a few too many times and was tired of sending it in to get fixed.(it was just the watch face that broke, the watch kept on ticking) All you have to do is read the simple directions on entering your age, weight, sex and hit start during your work out. When you're done you can see your average heart rate during your workout, the length of your workout and the calories burned. There are many other things you can do with it such as set an alarm if your heart rate gets too high/too low, set an alarm to wake you up from your power nap, do lap times, etc
I ordered Teriyaki, Original and Black pepper flavored ones.  The other two flovors are quite good but this one, teriyaki, is really sub-standard.  It has sandy texture and quality is very uneven compared to the others. 
Overall, not terribly happy with this units user interface and design.  The spartan instructions require pressing buttons referred to in the manual as "SW1" SW2" etc, but they are not labeled as such on the device.  You toggle through modes that are abreviated on the display with just 2 letters to tell you what they are ("TR" "CH" what??) Just an unfreindly interface all around. Look for a better unit.
Shouldn't you  people know by now?Say it with me:NEVER BUY MOVIE GAMES.A friend of mine bought it and it was horrible.It was way too easy to die in,etc,etc,etc.Hey listen.Keep you money.Your investment isn't in here
After purchasing this product, I found there were several problems with scanning. I contacted Nuance (who purchased ScanSoft) to ask for assistance from Technical Support. However, I then learned they want $9.95 for each incident when a request is made by email. Not by phone - by email. After putting out a great deal of money for this product, I should not have to pay $9.95 for assistance with each issue that is a problem with their product. Save yourself a great deal of grief and avoid this product. I regret that Amazon does not allow me to give this product "0" stars.
It's fascinating to compare my own experiences, having lived now 3 years in Germany, to those of an American from 125 years earlier.  I've been learning to speak German, and his Appendix on the "awful" German language was hilarious.  In poking fun at German grammar (e.g., long sentences), he purposely commits the same errors in his own writing.  The scene "riding" the glacier down the Alps was so funny I had tears running down my face.  It's amazing to think that it was written in 1879, when America was barely a century old, and the insights and perceptions then can be incredibly, eerily similar to either my or "typical" American's attitudes today. ---  --- I'd recommend it to anyone, but particularly to anyone visiting or living in Europe.  It's way funnier than his "Innocents Abroad", which is also a good read on travel in Europe
My son received a Bumbo seat for Christmas.  At five months of age, he rolled out of it and was laying on top of the seat.  At six months of age, he turned in the seat and fell on to his HEAD on two different occassions.  The seat was on a flat surface.  He did this and I was standing or sitting right next to him. --- I loved this seat when he first got it.  I told everyone I knew about it. He has two older siblings and he  loved to be able to watch them play.  His siblings loved him sitting in the seat because he was at their level.   ---  Now, I have absolutely NO confidence in the safety of this seat.  It is completely useless as his "own body weight" DOES NOT "keep baby in place" as advertised.  The seat has been rendered useless in my home because it is NOT safe and it is safer to put him in a traditional bouncy seat or on the floor.
It is very small and looks very cool.you can charge it very fast.ts sound is very good too.t has radio function too
I have had plenty of pairs of Doc's but these are not the best for me........... they are not comfy and they tend to be a little tough to break in. As soon as I put them on and took ONE STEP ---- there right across the top of the shoe is a nice big crease......... It does not look nice and I am "ticked" about that...........plus I didnt expect the laces to have green and maroon colors mixed into the brown laces...... it looks dorky! ---  --- Plus I have a manufacturing flaw in them.  Inside the heel the seam isnt quite right and it rubs my skin and hurts like heck!  ---  --- Hopefully the next model I get isnt like thses or they are going back....... Putting up with these for now.......
I like to a lot this product, and I work very well and also has a low price, to obtain this is a good offer for who buys it
Everything I need to file my Fed and State taxes. I did not expect the Deduction pro to be included; pleasely surprised. I have used Taxcut for a few years now. I like the import of previous year tax data (less typing). ---  --- It seems H&R has an online version. It would be nice if their online version can import data from my purchased version. Oh well, maybe next year
My husband loves this product.  It is concise, and, best of all, it fits in his shirt pocket.  He won't use any other weekly planner
I usually enjoy products by Philosophy but this stuff is not worth washing the family Xolo with, amigo. Trust me. This stuff STINKS! If a margarita is what you are craving, then stop in at the local Don Pablo's at lunchtime. Not only does this stuff smell bad on the skin, but, as the bottle warns, using this product can cause irritation to the skin and the urinary tract. Not good. ---  --- I will say one good thing about this product: it made the drains in my home smell lime-fresh for days after having poured the entire contents down them.
Simply the most entertaining mockumentary / film I've seen in years and one of the best ever. The DVD is packed full of extras and outtakes so the fun lasts much longer than you'd expect. Jenna Fischer is brilliant and James Gunn is hilarious.  You just have to buy it to understand
I bought 8 size D's for my boom box thinking it would be the answer to having to buy batteries every few camping trips.  Wrong answer.  I was able to play 2 1/2 CDs before my box was out of juice.  Game over.  I realize these batteries lose their charge quickly by sitting around, but these batteries were fresh off the charger when I left.  I figured they'd at least last into the night, but they were finished before sundown.  Don't believe anyone who says these are for high drain devices...  I got fooled.  Fool me once, shame on you.  We can't get fooled again
Filmed in 1933, this movie is in black and white, and might be considered dull and slow-moving by today's standards.  An accurate chronology of the six wives of Henry VIII, the characters of the wives are rather  undeveloped, and the movie does not delve very deeply into the important  religious and political questions around which the marriages centered.  A  good introduction for those who are unfamiliar with the basic story, but  the serious scholar will want to conduct further research
For those of us brought up on Vegemite, Marmite doesn't make the grade.  For those brought up on Marmite, Vegemite seems a poor substitute.  For Americans who only seem to put sweet stuff on their cake (oops, I mean "bread") both are revolting. ---  --- I think that a major reason why Americans abhor these savoury spreads is that being used to spreading honey and jam on their breakfast toast, they tend to use like quantities of Vegemite or Marmite.  To uninitiated the taste of either spread applied so lavishly is going to be overwhelming.  Before passing judgment on these spreads, you would do well to heed the advice of "Joanna" or "mtspace" and apply thinly. It also works best with very fresh bread or hot toast. ---  --- Incidentally, I believe that Marmite was first.  Vegemite was an Australian imitation created several years later.  It was originally called Parwill - a pun which will be appreciated by Aussies and Brits but which may not be understood by Americans because of the way the words are pronounced. ---  --- I only give Marmite four stars.  That probably tells you my upbringing
You'll need a large throw pillow for a back cushion - 20" at least. Also, the chair is fairly low. Seat cushion is okay, about the same quality as Target or Home Depot. Construction is plastic wicker over a steel frame, so I suspect some rusting over the years. Overall, a very nice chair, at a decent price-point. If you want a nice patio chair cover that fits fairly well, check out Veranda Patio Chair Cover 78932 on Amazon ($19 each). The cover is heavy duty, and is waterproof
The sweater I received was extremely thin: I had expected something more like an LL Bean cardigan, which I dearly love.  I was wrong.

My husband and I recently went to Florida to see his mother in the hospital. She had suddenly become ill. As we waited for her prognosis, we went to several local grocery stores to try to locate Drake's Funny Bones which my husband considered a comfort food that his mother would always get for him when he would visit. We looked to no avail.   --- Unfortunately his mother passed away the next day. We headed home to Arizona and the first thing I did was try to find out how to get some of these snack cakes. I knew that it would mean so much for him to have them, if anything out of remembrance of his mother.   --- I located Gristedes through Amazon and was so excited. The package arrived today. Unfortunately I was at work when my fiancé notified me, and I sat with him on the phone while he opened his surprise. Both of our eyes filled with tears and you could hear the cry in his voice when he realized what it was. He said it was the best gift that he had ever received.   --- Thank you for allowing him to have a little extra tribute to his mom for Christmas time.  
Have tried about six times to install it.  I've followed all of the online troubleshooting advice, all to no avail.  It says it installed with three nonfatal errors and five warnings.  It tells you to check the log.  Well, there are over 85k entries and even if I found the errors I don't see any way to correct the errors. When I try to run it I get "starter MFC Application has encountered a problem and needs to close".  I'll be returning this puppy to Amazon for a replacement
It is obvious that this movie is full of lies.  Although I have not actually seen it, I know this to be true because I have seen many discussions on the movie on the Fox news channel (God bless them!).  The way he attacks poor Mr. Heston is deplorable.  Can't Michael Moore tell from the comments Charlton made at the rallies that he doesn't have his faculties about him?  I am also unsure that Mr. Heston even said the things that the movie shows him saying.  The ability of Hollywood to manipulate and edit sound is truly amazing, making it appear that My President (Heston) is an uncaring, babbling idiot by simply using his own words - shame on you Michael!  And as for the way he got the gun from the bank, I agree with the other posters that the entire point of a bank giving away free guns is completely nullified by the fact that they didn't give him the gun the minute he walked into the bank.  Bravo to those who figured that out.  Also, Michael Moore is fat.  Take that Pinkie
Now i dont usually write reviews for things, but when i do its because i really like it or i really hate it. And i must say this is one of the best, if not the best music magazine out there. But before you go on if you like bands like simple plan or new found glory just stop and go read something else. this magazine is for indie rock fans or just plain rock. They give you reviews on at least 30 albums and have great interviews with artists. Now this is not like "Spin" who jumps on anything that is popular at the moment to make some money. I enjoyed reading this summers issue ( with Death Cab for Cutie on the front) so much that I ordered it the day i got the magazine. A must have for indie fans
i think this product would be great, but wasn't able to use it becasue the description of it on this website and on phiolosphy's website does't give you one tiny bit of information.  the very last step, the very last sentence says that you shouldn't use this product if you are prone to breakouts because this will cause a severe breakout.  the reason i bought this was to clear up my face, so it would have been nice to know this before i am about to apply it to my skin
Please change your name to (KID RAP)..  When you start producing true ROCK cd's then and only then you should put rock back into your fake name...  Stop playing both sides..  I realize that the rap- hip hop scene is much easier because over half the fan base is little girls /boys and people that dont have a clue what music is all about..  --- Do yourself a favor and take the rap/hip hop out of your so called music. One day you will realize that the rap/hip hop scene is like a bad smell that real music fans hate and wish would go away..    ---       
After seeing Match Point, which I loved, I figured I had to see Scoop. All I can say is "Oh my GAWD!" --- Scoop is perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. Woody Allen really should stay out of his own movies. And the rest of it, the story, acting, editing etc, were just painful to watch.  ---     I can't believe he went from Match Point to this dribble
Everything about this collection is first class.  The pictures on the site were accurate  - I was glad I made the purchase - it saved me hundreds of dollars compared to the retail mark-up from my other distributor of patio furniture.  I ended up purchasing the whole collection
When I first got my Motorola Q I was disappointed with the standard battery and was having to charge the battery every night or be caught with a dying battery in mid day.  With some setting changes and the 1700 mAh battery that is now far in the past.  For the price, it is an excellent deal. --- Ji
I was a student of Mr. Clawson's, and highly recommend any student of his to use this book as a study guide
I don't know about you folks, but I have small ears.  Though the sound on these ear buds are good, I can't keep the darn things in my ear for more than 30 seconds at a time because they're too big for me, and FORGET about trying to walk and keep them in my ears.  Unfortunately, this renders them completely unusable and they sit in my drawer of orphaned cords. Good idea, badly designed for size differences.
I read this book for a book report, and because i could not choose another one i could not stop reading it. Because I was forced to read this book I now have the knoledge and misfortune of this pathetically boring story. The steriotypical characters hurried through the story full of excuses. 1 star for one very boring book
I first heard Dan singing background vocals on the Jackson Browne album "Late for the Sky".  I was 16.  I went out and bought this album (which I STILL have!!) even though I had never heard it.  I had the pleasure of seeing Dan open for the Eagles at the Spectrum in support of this album in Phila, in 1974; I was a junior in high school.  They all joined in on "Best of My Love" and it just blew mw away. He had this really interesting piece of cloth on his piano.  Few people had heard of him prior to this album. This is by far his BEST album.  It is more rock and roll than the rest of his sappy later work in the 80's and a true songwriting gem.  I can remember singing "Morning Sky" in my friend's Ford on the way to school. You have to listen to it over and over.. "Someone's Been Tellin' You Stories" had a sly sexual rhyme in it that was not played on radio at that time. The musicianship on this album only serve to enhance the quality of the songwriting.  This was the most raw of Dan's albums, and by ar, the most superior.  Sadly, Dan is now fighting advanced prostate cancer (check out his website).  Let's hope he will make a full recovery and record and tour again soon.  This is a must have for anyone who is a fan of any 1970's rock and roll. 
I paid over $150 for this watch a couple of years ago, and I loved it when I first bought it (as do many of the other reviewers on this page). However, it took about 18 months for the band to break, and then less than 2 years for the watch to completely die. The solar charger slowly quit working - at first I just couldn't set the hands on the watch because it was stuck in "recover" mode, but the digital display was still correct so it was still somewhat usable. Then after a few months of this, everything went blank. I sent it off to Casio expecting a quick, inexpensive repair (or even a free repair, as I expected them to stand behind their product). Shortly thereafter, I received a repair estimate for $94.11 - more than the watch currently sells for brand new! So...in my opinion, the watch is probably worth the $69.00 that it currently sells for, but don't expect it to last more than a year or two. I won't be buying another Casio
I bought this game on PS2 for my daughter who is 12, and she has had a ball playing it. Though there are English subtitles because it is spoken in very fast Japanese, that doesn't take away from the game's adventures. The instructions given are very clear, and though it does take skill to master some of the tasks,  it really is quite enjoyabl
I have had so much fun learning Bio feedback and learnig to breath.  The exercises and the story line are really helpful to achive control and develope skills for meditation.  I highly recommned this product.  I will be purchasing the add-on in the near future
The seller was super fast, the product well packaged and as described. Thank you
I have owned the WMR-968 for several years now and have spent more on 'replacement' parts than if I had bought an entire new unit.  Primarily, the solar transmitter on the rain gauge continually fails to bring the charge up to enough power for the transmitter to transmit back to the base.  I have replaced this transmitter unit three times (twice with the 'new' style).  Living in the Phoenix area, we don't run into too many cloudy or rainy days, but as soon as it doesn't get sunlight for any length of time, the display reads all dashes (not receiving a signal).  So when it rains here, I usually don't get a reading of how much because this thing stops working.  The anemometer is mounted on the same pole just above the rain gauge with the both of the solar transmitters also mounted on the same pole.  The anemometer works consistently and fine.  Both OS and the local distributor say the distance is too far, the unit must have gone bad and needs replacement, etc.,etc.  Replacing the solar unit didn't help and the distance can't be too far for one unit and not the other.  No one can help with this issue.  So my suggestion would be to spend the extra bucks and get something more reliable. 
This case is good for protecting your camera from nicks and scratches caused by storing it in purses, briefcases or luggage.  But don't count on it to protect your camera from falls, dirt or dust. --- It looks good, the PowerShot logo gives an authentic look to it
Teas vary greatly in quality and the price reflects that.  This is a moderately price matcha tea so don't except the best flavor.  It is nutritious so it may be better as a flavor additive to drinks, desserts, broth, etc.  Real matcha can also be bitter and an acquired taste.  Japanese often drink it with tiny sugar candies to offset the bitterness.  Matcha also contains a lot of antioxidants so it may be helpful to some to stat incorporating it into their diet.  If you don't like the taste an easy drink is to mix it with orange juice
Just received one for my son's birthday. He loves it as he has a laptop like daddy. The quality is terrible, like another user's experience the right side of the device doesn't work properly and this is brand new. Apparently the sensors on the device don't line up properly with the go circles or volume icons on pages with them on the right side. I can't exchange it as I am not in the US so we can only play with half a book unless we experiment with finding where the right side sensors actually are. This of course is very frustrating to a 3 yr old as it really messes up alot of stuff. --- Also the type of pencil seems rally sharp and brittle for a 4 yr old.  PS the box says for 4-8 yr olds vs Amazons text of less than 4 by the manufacturer
Full of good health goodies! Lots of fiber, omega-3, flaxseed. Cooks fast.  I use the stove top method, add raisins and pecans. 
I have been buying this stuff since the wholesale club had opened in my town seven years ago.  I was horrified this past Thanksgiving to find out they no longer carried it.  I tried to improvise with garlic powder and Italian seasoning, but my homemade ravioli were not nearly as good as they had been in the past.  I can't say enough great things about this stuff.  I use it to season burgers, steak, to spread over chicken with a little olive oil before baking and grilling and in all of my stuffed pasta dishes.  It's not just great, it's AMAZING!!
This is a great product for anyone wanting to be able to cut with precision and avoid the $200+ price tags!  This is a much lower priced product, and it is far superior to the smaller razor blade trimmers
cheap, cheap, cheap- I know you get what you pay for, but 20 bucks(after shipping) is a lot to pay for nothing in return. The thing didn't respond to my guitar, and the store said that it's probably defective and to return it. But, you don't get repaid for any of the shipping, so it's hardly worth the effort. Buying this just resulted in headache and frustration. 
Sickly weak queasy stomach after eating the bar for 4 hours or more. I havent felt so yuky and sickly in a long time. You cannot return these or any food items to Amazon. --- The Coconut was moist and tender, yet no good flavor.

After constant dropouts for the past 6 months and no help from the "Belkin Bozo's"(support). I received a long delayed canned e-mail answer to my problem which didn't help a bit. I finally got rid of this piece of junk and installed a Linksys Network Card. Both Linksys hardware and software are a vast improvement. No more dropouts. --- I would suggest that prospective purchasers of Belkin products hesitate before buying.. It's one thing to have a product that works intermittantly, but it's really frustrating when Product Support is worthless
Very disappointed. I bought this in hopes of relief from pain and pressure after I pulled a pelvic muscle at about 30 weeks pregnant. It has not helped me and has been annoying. The L-XL is too large but the S-M was too small. The material folds and rolls under my clothes and there's nowhere for the extra flap of material in front to go. I get sweaty underneath it and it's difficult to get my underwear back under it after using the bathroom---which I'm obviously doing frequently at 34 weeks! This was the only pregnancy belt available at the shop I went to. I wish I'd had the chance to try on others to compare
I love Funny Bones. First of all I'm a sucker for chocolate and peanut butter together. Add an incredible consistancy- shiny chocolate coating around chocolate cake with peanut butter cream filling- well, put these in the fridge a spell, take them out, and Voila! The perfect munchy snack attack. Enjoy
What a great line of sauces the Scarpetta brand brings to the table.  I have tried all of them and the time saving of having these already in my kitchen is very helpful.  I am able to put a what seems to be a different, slow cooked italian meal on the table each night in just minutes.  The flavor profile of each of the Scarpetta brands is unique and tastes truly homemade.  You can feel the love that went onto each sauce.  Try them, you won't regret it
This is Hawking's attempt to write about complicated physics for those of us who did not do well in math and therefore did not take the advanced sciences requiring ability in math.  While still not an easy read, it it much easier than the BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME that he wrote for laypeople before this.  A person who wants to know what the current scientific thinking is about the nature of the universe will find it worth spending the time it takes to read and digest this book, as they will be reading about it from one of the leading scientists in this field.  Older teens who have some interest in sciences may also find this to be a helpful introduction to the concepts they think they want to study in depth
I used these pads when I first started nursing.  They did a good job of keeping me from leaking onto my clothes.  However, my nipples were incredibly sore.  When I took my baby to her first appt., the pediatrician suggested cloth pads.  WHAT A DIFFERENCE!  Yes, they did cause me to leak through a little, but that was needed.  WHen ALL the moisture from let down is pooled up against your breast it causes sore nipples for some moms.  Don't use these.  Buy some cloth ones instead that will allow your nipples to breath (I use the Imse Vimse)
our MFC - 8840DN worked fine until a paper jam inside the machine caused damage that couldn't be fixed by the sales technician.  Lots of waiting for a response from Brother at their call in website.  They waited out the warrenty.  Will never buy from Brother or Amazon again as a result of this
We bought this game yesterday for our daughter.  The dolls are very difficult for her to dress.  We have to do it for her.  Also, two of the dresses have torn already after playing the game only about 4 times.  She loves the game and the princesses, and it does teach memory, but it could be made much better.
My niece was learning about the birth of Christ at school when I got her this Nativity Set.  She was so happy and it was so easy for me to continue teaching her about the birth of Christ and Christmas.  Thanks - I was very satisfied with this item and so was my niece
                                            --- Lemony the game is not for hardcore gamers. It doesn't aspire to be.  It shouldn't be compared to Warcraft or Resident Evil 4. ---       --- The game was developed by AMAZE for Activision.  Any one familiar with the first three Harry Potter Movie co-ordinated games (through Electronic Arts EA Games) is familiar with Amaze.         ---             --- The first three Potter games were fun and a bit of challenge for children and for those adults who were new to PC gaming.  The player wandered around the magical world of Hogwarts, collecting jelly beans and wizard cards.  What was fun was not completeing the tasks or learning new magic, what was fun was the freedom to discover new areas and find secret places.   ---        --- Fans of the Potter games will recognize the same mechanics of gameplay outfitted  in  a new location, jelly beans are replaced with golden eyes, golden hearts refuel stamina instead of chocolate frogs, playbills and letters are granted instead of wizard cards.  Players will also recognize the flavor of  wonderful score the game is set to, enjoyable, appropiate, but not overbearing with some familiar notes.    ---          --- Lemony isn't quite as good as the aforementioned Potter games. The reason being Lemony is not a fun story. While ficticious, Lemony is a story of the relentless abuse of three very droll and very wealthy orphans.   Its much more fun to play as a boy, who has left his abusive Aunt and Uncle behind, entering a magical world to be educated at Hogwarts.  I rather enjoyed learning to how to fly Buckbeak in Prizoner of Azkaban. In Lemony, I'm rather relieved I solved the train signal puzzle, the thought of having children run over and over and over by a train until I did, was depressing me.    ---    --- Yet, Lemony will provide some consolation to those who have been disappointed by EA's latest Potter offering, The Goblet of Fire.  While there is an adjustment to the droll circumstances, the task of discovering your world will take over and the game will eventually command your attention.    ---     --- While Lemony isn't bad, it isn't that good, either.  They renderings of the children are not the most flattering they could be, and the villians are boorishly ugly.     ---    --- The gameplay controls aren't half as good as the Potter games, and they weren't the greatest.  There's a match game puzzle in a cellar, that only shows up per every install, instead of every game. I did complete it and nothing happened on my game, which maybe the reason the puzzle won't show up in the rest of the games in a particular installation.  It has done this twice on me, and I'm not going to uninstall and install a third time to see if it happens again. It had no effect on my score or letter or eye collecting.  The camera angles aren't well mapped for shooting.  I was supposed to shoot a rat, but the camera got behind a ceiling lamp, and while the rat was biting me, all I could see was the inside of a lamp shade. Suff like that.   ---      --- Still its better than most children's games out there, and it plays!  As you may have guessed, there is violence.  When I shoot  a rat in Lemony, it is shot with a rotten egg lobber. Rotten eggs are your bullets, and the player stuns the enemies, instead of killing them.  About time. ---    --- I've played Lemony three times, the third time it was going through the motions.  Once the few skills of jumping, aiming the egg lobber, and  the boot puncher had been mastered, there wasn't any interest left. But for the time I did play, I did enjoy it.     ---    --- The games by AMAZE are a category unto themselves. They are not action games based on a trigger finger, nor are they the point click boring adventure games beset with brain teaser puzzles in a futuristic world. They are a relaxing time where you don't have to test your brain, just delight it.   ---    --- If you have never played the Potter games and are new to PC gaming I recommend Lemony, it is a good place to start.  If you are a fellow Potterhead and felt betrayed buy Goblet of Fire, Lemony will sustain you.
For the price this product is great - the bubbles were thick and rich and lasted a long time.  The scent was light and fragrant, not over-powering like some other products.  For those who love their bubble baths - highly recommended
This was the first brand of nursing pads I tried.  My first few weeks of nursing were very painful and these pads were a bit scratchy.  Yet after trying several brands of nursing pads, I came back to Lansinoh.  They are the most absorbent and discreet disposable pad out there and after I had been nursing for a while they ended up being the most comfortable. The best deal I have found has been amazon's price for 3 boxes. 
The only good thing I can say is the print quality is fine and the wireless network works.  But...software installation is long and tedious (and took three times on one laptop to get to work). Installed drivers cause my PC to take 45+ seconds longer to boot and sometimes (about 30%) stop the shut-down sequence (I have to click "end" in a dialogue box).  The ink runs out (even the big black one) amazingly quickly and replacements are $54 at Costco.  It seems you gotta get ONLY HP cartridges, as third-party cartridges fail.  I'll never buy another HP printer
Save yourself time and buy any book by Greg LeMond (Greg Lemond's Complete Book of Bicycling) or John Howard (John Howard's The Cyclist's Companion) -- they are both far better writers, well-rounded bicyclists, and honorable family men -- good role models for all true cycling athletes, young and old alike.  Lance Armstrong is good at chronicling his many bicycling events and achievements in this book, but what is notably missing from this text is the experience of a genuine champion.  Lance Armstrong would sell his own grandmother's last pair of socks in order to succeed -- leaving his family behind in order to pursue his one-dimensional goal of winning the Tour de France.  He sold his wife and three helpless kids for bicycling success and he degrades the sport and his wonderful family by publicly flaunting his association with a pathetic and desperate rock singer ... yawn.  Better to settle down with Greg LeMond's wonderful book for real depth, excitement, and rich experience and learn how to become a well-rounded cyclist and a real champion cycling athlete and family champion as well
I LIKE THIS TV SERIES, BETTER THAN THE MOVIE THAT MOVIE WAS A DISASTER IN ALL FRONTS, ROBERT CONRAD IS WONDERFUL, & THE CAST IS GREAT
7 out of the 25 disks would not write.  I didnt much care for the product considering this factor. 
All the splenda products are good.  But I like the ones that are part splenda and part sugar as they are good for baking.  Good if you have a diabetic in the house or are trying extra hard to lose weight and are a sugarholic
This magazine is my dream magazine. I subscribed to it immediately after reading a few articles while my parents were shopping at the tractor supply store. It has quite a few useful articles covering everything from animal health to hoof trimming, to special breed information and generators. I think it's a must for anyone who has ever been interested in farming or ranching, or just getting back to the country life
though the sound as such is like music, it is really hard to get to play this without lessons. Suggest a starter book with the instrumen
This table is about twice the table you would expect at the price. Its size is ideal with a 2 passenger teak bench.  Kompur wood is so like teak; we're staining our teak furniture to match the Kompur wood.  It looks marvelous with the 30" round folding table. Fit and finish are A Plus.  Can't rate durability yet or it would have 5 stars
 I'm very happy with the craftsmanship of the swoard and the delivery service. The exactness of the finish and,the wrap was done with every bit of care as a swoard made of metal. My son was also very happy with the workmanship and quality when he opened it on Christmas. ---  Thanks everyone, --- G. Hanso
We are huge scone lovers and were absolutely disappointed with the taste of these scones.  The mix was easy enough to assemble and bake but the scones have a decidely odd smell and very caustic after-taste.  My husband, who will eat just about anything, threw the whole batch in the trash after trying his first one.  We had high hopes, but sadly, this product just didn't deliver
This is a kick piano, not a hand piano and as such it needs to be mounted in a baby's crib.  We thought it would be useable if we just held the piano in place for our daughter to kick, or for her to use her hands on the keys - it isn't.  As we use her crib for sleeping, not playing, this has been a total waste of money.   --- At 10 months my daughter is now able to sit and press the keys on the piano with her hands, but the response of the keys isn't instant and the noise is so soft that she doesn't recognise that she's making it work.  Her sister's toy xylophone with twice the number of keys, an obvious sound and an instant response to her touch is far easier and far more satisfying for her to use
I, too, experienced the "Blue Screen of Death" on my laptop which has XP pro on it.  I had to uninstall the card software in order to stop my system from continuously rebooting.  On another note, the install of the router was GREAT, regardless.   ---  --- I didn't get anywhere with the Tech support group and had to return everything. ---  --- Anthon
To me, this game was seriously disappointing. So disappointing, I didn't finish the second case before setting it down forever.  ---  --- I was highly entertained - at first. It's cute, funny, and going around clicking on things for a new DS user was highly entertaining. However, it quickly got older.  ---  --- 1. You can't skip through the horrendously long dialog - ever. Even after you've heard it about a million times because you're clicking on people hopelessly in frustration unable to figure out what to do. ---  --- 2. I found myself looking for an internet walk through, yes, on this simplistic game. I couldn't figure out what to click and wandering around hopelessly for thirty minutes reading over dialog you've read a thousand times just gets too frustrating even for my typical patience level. ---  --- 3. Possible Spolier - There seemed to be a glich in the second story in which I talked to the wrong person at the wrong time and then I could never get a ticket into the planetarium. After that, I just couldn't take it any more and gave up. ---  --- 4. The places and people never change. For each case, from my understanding, it's all the exact same tiny few places. I'm not a big gamer, but I like a world bigger than three feet.  ---  --- I let a friend borrow it and thus far she is enjoying it more than me.  ---  --- Just to help this review - I'm a college-age female and this is my first gaming console, although I've played the PS2 quite a bit. Maybe it's really a hit or miss but I don't really recommend it for anyone but someone with a high patience level. A REALLY high patience level
Damn. There's nothing remarkable about the second item on this DVD; it's your standard European-made sexploitation film. "The Wild, Wild World of Jayne Mansfield," on the other hand, is reprehensible. It's a hodge-podge of vacation footage of Mansfield, clips from her movie project, and material entirely unrelated to Mansfield, linked only by the voiceover... and then, after an hour or so of light-hearted softcore buffoonery, the movie cuts to her death, spending the last twenty minutes obsessing on her husband and children and the large, mostly empty mansion she has left behind. ---  --- This movie has the feel of something slapped together for the sole purpose of trading off a famous name after Mansfield's death. This is exploitation in its worst form. I found the sudden change in tone, the large volume of non-Mansfield material, and the sheer obsessiveness of the last twenty minutes disgusting in the extreme. Those looking for cheesy bad movies to enjoy, or softcore porn to tittilate, go elsewhere; this one is not merely bad, but evil
I received this item as a gift and was disappointed when I pulled it out of the box. It's okay, but not as cute looking as the photo makes it seem. The beads on the hem and chest look nice in the photo, but are rather cheap looking.  --- It looks like something I could make myself. Very cheap and plain looking.
I recently bought one of these babies for my niece seeing that she loves music but I was unwilling to pay an arm and a leg. It was a reasonable price and offers just what it delivers. She seems to really enjoy and found it to be easy to load both music and documents. The only real problem that I had with is that it costed less a few days after I purchased it. But that's really a personal problem
paid double what i found at another site outside of amazon/this store - NEVER AGAIN! ---  --- 
These earrings are very good quality, sent to me quickly, and in a jewelry bag.  A very nice gift
Great flash, all the good qualities of the SB800 but less of the data dump and decision quagmire! It has the built in flash disperser, its lighter than the 800, so unless you're into more info than you need, go with the SB600. Oh, it has a shorter recycle time too.
I love this product.  My eye brows are growing, but not all over in the areas where I'm putting the product.  The hair has become darker, but nothing extreme, just in a way where I'm able to see it now (I'm naturally a toehead).  I would recommend this to others, but I'm saddened that it's so hard to find, and I was unable to do so in a store
This adapter was supposed to charge ww600i as listed , but it did not even fit it . Its totally false information being given for this item ..will never purpchase it from this merchant ever ..cant belive Amazon has these untrustworthy merchants
I love this birdbath.  I've had it several months and it hasn't tarnished at all.  Due to the review about it being 'tippy' I added extra weight to it by putting sand in the column and then sealing the bottom so it couldn't escape.  It hasn't tipped over yet, and we've had some bad storms in the Midwest.  Highly recommend.  I am adding to my original post 2/2007.  Don't make the mistake that I did in thinking this was a COPPER birdbath.  My search term was 'copper birdbath' and I didn't notice that this says copper-finish.  Some metal/gray spots are starting to show up in the bowl of the birdbath.  I should have read the description more carefull
Avent makes the best washable baby bottles around, so we felt that their sippy cups would be just as good. Well we were wrong. Of the five cups we had, all of them leaked and have since been thrown out. The cups are five different pieces vs other brands that use three  pieces, which makes them harder to wash, harder to put together, and more pieces to lose. As far as sippy cups go, these are among the most expensive you can buy and worst that we used out five different brands. We have had great luck with Greber's and Playtex's. Please avoid
I would not reccomend this product. It was cheaper at Amazon.com than walmart, but It took forever to get. It took two weeks for us to get it. When caption said ships 5-7 days. Than when we did get it, several pieces were broken. Major pieces. When I called the company, (which I was on hold for 30 minutes) then told me that we had so many pieces that were broken (5) that we needed to return it. I told them no, it's over 100 lbs and I am 7mth preg. they then changed the tune and said they would ship the parts they would be here in 4 weeks. Another mth. So  it took almost 2 mths to get this product. It is not worth the problems. Plus, nothing was labeled, and you had to figure out what pieces were what. Plus, the shelves inside the unit are WHITE, the armoire is natural but the shelves inside are white. I called the company and they said this is true.
Basic smoker, but an outstanding value for the price.  Arrived before expected, well-packed, easy assembly.  Smokes efficiently, although the temperature gauge never goes to "ideal."  I'm very pleased with this product
Nothing says 'Taste of Italy' like a gallon of Tuscan's finest.  The aromatic flavor of your favorite vintage is proper with any main course, even veal!  It's even great paired with dessert!  Don't be fooled by cheap imitations folks, this is the real thing! ---  --- Remember: If it's Tuscan, it's Kosher!  Now with extra whiteness
I thought these were amazing.  My favorite is the Socorro blend.  A review said they were soggy, but I'm not sure what they mean.  They are very crisp with nice and chewy fruit.  Despite the fruit, they aren't sweet but the sweet in the fruit really balances out the hotness of the other seasoning.   --- As for the price, these are expensive nuts and high quality ingredients.  The flavors are unusual, but perfect.  I am defiantly going to order more
A friend of mine gave me this cd about a year ago, I listened to a few minutes of it and was like "What is this crap?" and I shelved it for a couple months. I then picked it back up and gave it another listen. To my surprise it was really catchy to me. The music (and lyrics) are simple, but thats what I like about them. Theyre simple! This is a great college-rock cd. I plan on checking out more Teenage Fanclub, and I suggest you do the same. Notable tracks are Sidewinder, What You Do To Me, and Is This Music?
The science is sound, but check it out yourself.   ---  --- Police, military, etc., are using it, Fortune 100, other governmental agencies.  Schools should use it, if they don't.  It puts the kids into their best possible learning state. ---  --- Seriously, 5 stars is not justice.  50,000 stars.  50,000 is the number of neurons directing your brain when you are in the zone.  The power the brain when "coherent" or not is tangible, and it's driven by the heart.   ---  --- You can sense it in a person, anger, happiness, whatever.  It's the healing state.  It's the creative state.  It's where hormones balance. 
These are just darling. They are tiny and perfect for my 7 year olds little ears. They are shiny and nicely detailed. You won't be disappointed
It's worth playing and spending hours of playing. Warning: This game is rated Mature for sadistic and nudity, not good for kids. Nonetheless, excellent graphics, movements, playability, etc, etc, and etc. No need to buy the walkthrough because the game it's not really that difficult. Can't wait for God of War 2 that will come out 2007 (which luckily for PS2 instead of PS3)
This product is very superior over prior versions.It plays back your text in your own voice.My accuracy has improved in Dragon NaturallySpeaking 9 over other previous versions I have used. Having been familiar with prior programs voice to text,it was easy to implement.It was a good investment. ---  --- The product came promptly, and with no hassles
Early on in the game you use a pistol and rifle and take down some stormtroopers for the New Republic as you explore their base, with no force powers. But events make a turn for the worse and you go to Luke and request for your lightsaber back. Then you begin to discover force powers as you search out the dark Jedi/killer of your girlfriend for the rest of the game. With amazing graphics and increddible duels, this game is simply magnificent. Plus the multiplayer is awesome (especially when you play CTF and give the other team a boat load of Storm Troopers you and your friend being rebels with one bot helping you against twenty or so Stormtroopers makes the game a game you'll never want to trade in! Plus the duels are fun to play again and again. I would have five stars but the game does have two or three puzzles that are quite difficult.  All in all a great game that any StarWars fan must own, any shooter fan really has to have, and if you like both, oooh you need it really bad
This product is not worth the money or trouble.  I also had problem with bubbles forming and also the sides curing up as my notebook warmed up.  It was too much bother to keep trying to smooth out the bubbles and press down the sides after curling back up.  Save your money and don't buy this. This would actually qualify for a zero star rating
I have to be pretty honest - I was excited to get this kit, but so far I've been disappointed.  Maybe I'm not getting the whole technique down, but I find the diagrams pretty generalized and the powder flakes everywhere it isn't supposed to (like under my eyes, making them look very raccoon-y and tired--and when wearing smoky eyes, I figure you probably want everything else to look pretty bright in comparison to the dramatic eye effect).  Maybe I can't pull of the look or maybe I'm not applying it correctly, but either way, it always ends up looking like a big, dark, glittery mess...I'm a big Bare Escentuals lover, but I was disappointed with this product. 
I was very pleased when this toy finally arrived.  The Blue Devil is removable and semi-posable (his arms move).  He is the same size as the Simpson figures from the Playmates line of toys, so I feel like he was made with collectors of those figures in mind.  The Homer donut-eating action doesn't always work correctly--the mouth and donuts aren't correctly synchronized, so sometimes the donuts miss his mouth--but that does not detract from the fun
Although merchandise arrived quicker than promised, and the color was perfect, the socks didn't even last through one baseball game.........lousy product!!
Ok, so this is probably not the best protection for your iPod, but what do you want for 6 bucks? I'm cheap. If you're not, buy something more expensive perhaps... ---  --- Pros: --- - It does protect the screen and click wheel nicely. --- - The flip-up top magnetically shuts and holds securely, which I guess helps if you happen to drop it. ---  --- Cons: --- - The belt clip is ridiculous. It's not a stationary clip. Instead it spins around, which makes the likelihood of it falling off your hip greater. This product is not for the joggers. --- - The leather strap that comes with it is too short, which makes it difficult to operate the iPod when it's around your neck. --- - It seems that the magnets leave marks on the areas not mentioned under Pros above. But, as long as you never take your iPod out of the case, no worries. --- - This is made for the 30 GB iPod Video, but it's actually a little big for it. It leaves room for the iPod to slide up and down in the case. It makes accessing the HOLD switch difficult sometimes when the flip-up top is down. It's easier to just open the top. ---  --- If you don't care about the cons and you are cheap like me, go ahead and buy it
The watch looks great; prominent, yet not overly large.  The orange really sets off the look.  The large luminescent indexes are easy to see long after dark.  I also like having both day and date complications, and to find an automatic watch with these features for less than $300 (way less on Amazon) is really a find.  You will need a pro to adjust the bracelet, though, as each link pin is held in by two tiny bushings that are impossible to replace without the proper jeweler's tools.  Another bother is that the watch gains over a minute a day.  Overall, I really like it.  It's become my daily wear watch. 
Without a Doubt, FFX is one of the best, if not the best, rpgs to come out on any of the current consoles.  It features an incredible and orignal story populated with interesting and varied characters.  Additionally, the sphere-gird system allows the player to develop character abilites in an interesting and innovative manner.  Admittedly, the sphere-grid system complexilty may scare away rpg newbies, but with a little time will become second nature to players of all skill levels.  Featuring a wonderful score (even by Final Fantasy standards)and impressive graphics (for the PS2) there is little reason for any video game fan not to pick up this title, even with the ever-present advent of FF 12 on the horizon
I was not at all satisfied with the nightguard, but the company accepted the return without question and refunded my money promptly
I bought these for my son for Christmas, they were first quality, arrived in time for christmas,and at a great price
I was a little worried that the bracelet would be too large for a 5 year old, but I got this for my daughter's birthday and it fits her perfectly.  I was also a little concerned that it might be cheap looking like other things I've bought from Amazon lately, but it's actually a very cute, well-made, cheap bracelet
The cable is really junk.  All I want is a cable to sync my phone and update software.  It won't do it.  Half of the time the computer fails to recognize the phone is connected.  A motorola brand data-only cable works just fine.  I was warned not to invest in cheap cables and I wish I would have listened.  The one potential plus is that it has a charger inline incase you nuke your phone and need to reload drivers.  Problem is, the thing connects and disconnects constantly torturing you with the beeps of connecting/disconnecting as mentioned above.  Save money and buy the OEM part. --- Moto cord $30 with software --- This cord $10 + $30 for moto cord when you realize it's junk.   --- Be smarter than me and heed the warnings
Otherwise it would have 5 stars.  Fits my Treo 680 even in the case, which is a big plus
many people have judged this album as a masterpiece i know. But to me this is just a collection of boring ambient sounds. This is unusual of me because i usually like ambient music. Another double ambient album - Seti - Pharos - is a real masterpiece. --- It is a real pity because the cover of this album is really stunning - but - you know - never judge the cover by its album.  --- Please if you have any feedback to this write to - carlogiova@yahoo.it - i would be happy to share thoughts.
I thought this was the MOST boring book I've ever read! I hated it and about 1/3 of the way through I quit reading it
The pants are not Juniors', they are Women's pants that go up past your waistline when you wear them
I am extreamly dissapointd with this game.  Every section and mission is exactly the same with the exception of the location.  There is absolutly no skill involved in beating the game which i was able to do in 3 sittings. 
The upgrade is $75 cheaper and you DON'T need to have a previous install of Windows to get it to work. Simply do the following: ---  --- 1. Boot with the Windows Vista Upgrade DVD. ---  --- 2. Click "Install Now." ---  --- 3. Do not enter a Product Key When prompted.  ---  --- 4. When prompted, select the Vista product edition that you do have. ---  --- 6. Install Vista normally. ---  --- 7. Once the install is complete, restart the DVD-based Setup from within Windows Vista. Perform an in-place upgrade. 8. Enter your Product Key when prompted.  ---  --- This is according to Microsoft's internal documentation, and reported by Paul Thurrott at Windows IT Pro
I like Meav's voice, and this CD is OK, if you like this kind of stuff. Think slow and somewhat depressing. I think Irish music has moved on so much since Bill Whehlan of Riverdance brought it into the modern times, and came up with this vocal sound, I guess to hark back to earlier times, which worked well because Riverdance has so much contrast in it and the choir songs only appear as relief to the other music. This is all a bit samey and dull. I would say saved by this lady's fine voice though
Cosmetically pleasing is about the only good thing you can say about this unit.  The included software does contain viruses.  The included software is a reminate of the late 80's to early 90's.  The tablet itself does not work under Win2000 nor WinXP.  Under 98 second edition it stops responding quite frequetly and you have to unplug and plug the unit back in to get it to respond again.  This unit would be great, if it came out 7 years ago.  You get what you pay for
i thought baby would be much more interested in this. it's colorful and easy to grab -- but for some reason, it's a non-starter
Yes the coffee is the best quality, pesticide free.  There are technical issues with the pods. 1 pod was broken when I opened up the pouch it was stored in.  For any pods to arrive broken when they are so expensive is just not acceptable.  Also, many times the pod is not working, but turning it around and pressing down on it with a fork or a spoon makes it work (I have Black & Decker Home Cafe Machine).  Great coffee, but I felt that I had to really work for it.  I also feel that to charage $15 to ship a box of coffee pods is a bit excessive, considering that they are being shiped from LA not HI
A great recording.  "The greatest bass solo ever recorded" (as put by another reviewer) is certainly a stretch, but the album is still magnificent.  Heavy Sounds is a title that accurately describes the music.  Buy and enjoy. 
This pendant looks great in the picture but when I received it, it looks like yellow glass, doesn't look like a crystal at all. I'm very dissapointed
Fails at it most basic function: to provide a non-leaking seal. --- You might as well throw the top away and just use your hand to cover  --- the top
This product is the best!  It's so simple to use- no heat- no thermals- just the simple turning of a crank. Simple is often better and that is definitely the case here.  I use the tool to laminate spec sheets for selling high end sports cars and the result is super professional. I suggest also getting a paper cutter from staples because you may want to trim up the end product.
This software only got one star because I couldnt give it a zero.  It never worked on my Windows XP computer.  I couldnt open the program, couldnt close it, couldnt get the sytem to shut down.  After a hard shutdown, Windows would not start.  Tech support couldnt figure out the problem.  I uninstalled Panda, reinstalled Norton and system is working fine.  I would not recommend
Perfectly simple and indistinguishable from the "real" Amazon - except the price. Thanks for everything
Very comfortable and feel. No one makes it like Under Armour
Two huge problems with this book. One, this self righteous club is leaving clues to a killer and "traveling and learning" when they already know his identity, so I guess he can keep on dismembering women until the psychiatrist figures it all out and then gets teary eyed over his new special wine glass. Two, the city of Los Angeles functions as a character in Kellerman's other novels and adds alot of realism to the novels. This thing drags on in some unnamed, nondescript city
This seems to be a decent changing pad with the exception of it not being easy to clean. I am having a real hard time cleaning it and never had this problem with other changing pads. It's almost porous! If you get this changing pad, plan on having a cover on it at all times to keep it clean.
I have owned this monitor for a little bit over one year and it died on me right after the one year warranty expired. The customer services rep told me that it will be $110 for a repair which I can almost buy a new one if I pay the shipping on top of that $110. I have other eight (8) LCD monitors in the house and no one has such a bad quality. I'll newver buy any Proview products ever. I will give zero star if there is one
Back in the 1970's my grandmother subscribed to Prevention. At that time, it was a wonderful magazine, filled with informative articles aimed at the "Prevention" of illness and the promotion of wellness (as the founder of Prevention, J.I. Rodale had preached). Articles about the role of vitamins and nutrition were light years ahead of their time. (J.I. can be given a lot of credit for bringing vitamins and supplements to the mainstream). Over the years, and especially after the tragic death of Robert Rodale (J.I.'s son), and the takeover by his wife and daughter, it has unfortunately transformed into a fluffy, tabloid-like "women's magazine" with scantily clad women on the covers, and one- or two-page articles instructing women to get killer abs and burn the fat. I think J.I. Rodale is probably spinning in his grave to see what his descendents have done to butcher this magazine, which bears NO resemblence whatsoever to what it used to be. I flipped through a copy in disgust recently to note, as another reviewer has stated, plenty of ads for DRUGS which really seems to go against the idea of preventing illness in the first place (whereas the old Prevention sang the praises of vitamins and health foods). I don't know why the Rodale family doesn't just scrap the title and call it something else, but alas, they are a major corporation now and I have little hope that this magazine will improve any time soon
Fast and easy ordering, Received frequent order status updates. Received order as expected (fast).  I love these earrings.  I have worn at least one day a week since I receive
I love that it sticks and doesn't slide. It is great for my 21 month old to feel part of the family when we eat
This product really needs Installation Assistance. Too many options and I spent 2 hours trying to figure it out. I'm going to call to get more info.  ---  --- ARRIVAL TIME = ***** 5 stars --- PRICE = ***** 5 stars --- Installation and Ease = * 1 sta
I have used many infant tubs and I love this one!  It folds so nicely I keep it in the kitchen pantry.  It fits in the sink, and I keep the faucet running like a little shower, and I can rinse her with fresh water.  I actually think the angle is great for an infant, but with a newborn I use one of those "yellow bear sponges" in the tub for extra support (but I use one with all the infant tubs I have used). 
while the verbatim has burned well in 100% of my recordings they fail to operate in at least 24 different dvd players
This is the best anti-chafing product I've ever used. I'm a 40 something marathon runner, heavier than the average marathoner. Every marathon I ran left me with a bloody chafed mess on my thighs-I just ran my first marathon with this product and not a chafe-my highest recomendatio
Over done is the best way to describe this over-the-top attempt to view gang life from the eye of a "stolen" video camera. 
Have had good luck with these batteries.  They last for a long time.  First time with Amazon and it was a good experience.  Will use them again
I proceeded to open the container then pour it all over myself, in front of my girlfriend. Imagine my embarassment with poweder all over myself. ---  --- Needless to say the evening did not go as planned. ---  --- Though I did take a bath, and the water did taste an awfully lot like milk. ---  --- My fault though, for thinking the company was Nido Powde
I read rolling stone for the music and those who make it, not for some guilt ridden, agenda blasting editorial team that feels their politics (and guilt at being so much the establishment they wish they could hate) is something we should all read about at nauseum. when they stick to music, it's good, when they parade their shreiking political views, it's boring. 
I was sooooooooo excited to see that this movie had been released, and I was not disappointed.  The dancing was magnificent, and it was amazing to see Patrick & Lisa together. --- I have to saythought for many....it was disheartening to see you perform with your wife, Patrick, because so many of us have fantasized of that same possibility! --- I would recommend it to ALL who love dance!  It is a beautiful tribute to what a person CAN do!
We ordered the umbrella to replace one that we had for many years. When the product arrived, we were surprised at the quality of the product for such a small price. We are very satisfied
