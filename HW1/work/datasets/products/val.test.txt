Best snack I've found in years. I keep these in my desk at work for a mid-afternoon appetite curb. Highly recommended by all my family and friends
For the price, these speakers are well worth the cost. Of course, in my opinion, anything that dosnt say "Creative" on it is usually worth the price. Not a lot of bass, but with the bass boost, these speakers sound real nice. Only bad thing I'll say is that M-Audio's tech department is really bad. Emailed them about a week ago inquiring about driver updates for Vista, still no answer. (my inquiry was about a different m-audio product)
I love these!  The only thing good about being on a gluten free diet is discovering these cookies!  I'm hooked.  I love the coffee flavor mixed with chocolate.  And for a dessert all the ingredients are pretty good
I LOVE this DVD, in fact I purchased 5 to give as Baby Shower Extras! --- I originally taped it from HBO, and my 3 Grandchildren almost wore it out! --- I was delighted to see it available on DVD, so I bought 5, and am keeping one in my DVD Library for my Great-Grandchildren some day to enjoy!
I bought this camera two years ago, the pictures were always perfect, even though from the sixth month it started getting stains everywhere, but then i found out that it was normal, not good but it usually happens to this cameras. But the worst of all is tha fact that it displays the Error 18 (E18), the lens gets stock and the camera won't work at all. I searched in google about it, because the user guide says nothing about this error, and then I read many reviews that said that there was nothing to do about it and many Canon cameras have the same defect... I am really mad and dissapointed on CANON, i will never buy a camera of this brand, and I wouldn't recommend it, unless you are willing to buy a camera for 2 years or LESS and then throw your money to the trash
I have thick, wavy hair and this product did nothing but make it feel wirey and frizzy. I don't think it is worth the money when I have found other poducts (such as Redken) that work better and cost less
Mr. Dennett's book demonstrates the ignorance, irrationality, and dishonesty  of humanists. Discussing the meaning of word materialsim, Professor Dennett says: ---  --- "In its scientific or philosophical sense, it refers to a theory that aspires to explain all the phenomena without recourse to anything immaterial--like a Cartesian soul, or "ectoplasm"--or God. The standard negation of materialistic in the scientific sense is dualistic, which maintains that there are two entirely different kinds of substance, matter and ...whatever minds are supposedly made of." (p. 302) ---  --- Philosophers stopped believing in dualism a thousand years ago with the development of metaphysics. A modern view is that man is an indefinability that becomes conscious of its own existence.  ---  --- The philosophy that God does not exist is not materialism, it is naturalism. Materialism is the view that all that exists is matter. Materialists frequently say that free will is an illusion and that the experience of the existence of oneself is some kind of epiphenomena. (In a quote below, you will see that Dennett puts free will in a list of things people belief in.) ---  --- It is not clear from the book whether Dennett is a materialist, but he is certainly a naturalist. Concerning the proof of God's existence, he trots out David Hume's "Who made God?" which is based on a misunderstanding of the principle of causality. I refer the reader to my personal website for my version of the proof. ---  --- Let's look at two quotes, the first is at the end of the chapter "Belief in Belief" and the other at the beginning of the chapter "Morality and Religion":  ---  --- "That is, isn't it true that, whether or not God exists, religious belief is at least as important as the belief in democracy, in the rule of law, in free will? The very widespread (but far from universal) opinion is that religion is the bulwark of morality and meaning." (p. 245) ---  --- " Without the divine carrot and stick, goes this reasoning, people would loll about aimlessly or indulge their basest desires, beak their promises, cheat on their spouses, neglect their duties, and so on.  There are two well-known problems with this reasoning: (1) it doesn't seem to be true, which is good news, since (2) is is such a demeaning view of human nature." (p. 279) ---  --- In the first chapter, he mentions "bulwark of morality" and "meaning." But in the second chapter, he leaves out "meaning."  If our purpose in life is not to get to heaven, what is our purpose is life?  ---  --- Whether religion supports morality can be determined by observing whether there is a correlation of moral conduct with religious belief. Mr. Dennett makes such a correlation to the detriment of religion by citing the high divorce rate of fundamentalist Christians. ---  --- There are worse things than divorcing your spouse. Disingenuousness can be worse and can take the form of leaving unsaid what should have been said. Mr. Dennett should have explained why he did not discuss the idea that religion gives meaning to life. ---  --- The only miracle mentioned in Mr. Dennett's book is the Shroud of Turin, which has on it a mysterious image of a crucified man.  Since no one claims to know how the image got there, it can be called a miracle. However, Mr. Dennett does not tell us anything about it. The reader is left to find out about the famous relic by looking it up on the internet.
 --- I agree with the person who said it's hard to chew and here is why. ---  --- Disect your slim jim length ways...there, do you see the hair? --- It is (allegedly) all made of cow hair...gross! That is the beef part I guess. --- Trans-fat (partially hydrogenated veg oil) and some really long word chemicals to make "mechanically separated" beef and chicken what looks like hair taste "good"? no thanks, glad I did not buy 100! ---  --- My dog really likes it but then again she eats other dog's p..p --- EEWWW!!!
Is Larry an actual redneck, or is it all really a joke inside "Larry's" mind?  I sometimes think that Dan Whitney (Larry's real name) knows what he's doing.  I think he is actually making a huge joke out of the rednecks who are totally in love with him.  He is openly mocking them, and when they might get a tad uncomfortable, but then he'll drop a politically incorrect joke into the routine, and they love him again.  Dan/Larry started out as a "normal" comedian (there's footage of him on youtube before his Larry incarnation), and wasn't really getting anywhere with that.  So he became a redneck, and is a multi-millionare now.  But all his redneck fans think of Larry as a "regular guy", despite the fact that Larry lives in one of those fancy houses that rednecks think only NYCers live in (for the record, NYCers don't all live in fancy houses.  There's a lot of working class people in NYC who live in regular houses and regular apartments).  So Larry is taking advantage of illiterate, easily amused rednecks.  Just put on a flannel shirt, fart, wear a Confederate flag, and say you hate liberals, then fleece the rednecks!  I don't think Larry really has a redneck mentality (even though he's originally from Nebraska, so he has some hillbilly cred, so to speak).  I think he's just making a ton of money off of easily amused people.     
This thermometer is totally worthless. It doesn't read the correct temp. on myself, husband or baby. When my little one was sick at 3 months old, this thing read 96.7 degrees on all three of us. I picked up a digital 'under the tongue' type and simply used it under his arm. Works great--cost me $3.   ---    ---  I can't GIVE this one away
WHat I like best is that it is non addictive. It puts you right to sleep within 20-30 minutes. It really helped me and my boyfriend regulate our sleep patterns
Adds a great fragrance to the room. We bought several different scents and placed them throughout the house. It's a different smell in every room. What a pleasant change from smelling the pets.
My 4 year old really wanted this for Christmas, after looking at similar products, we chose this one.  Should have spent the money on the one w/the DVD.  Tutu is WAY TOO SMALL - fits her 18" doll.  Mat is a little too sensitive, she tries to put her feet in the position and kicks off the music pads.  Only 2 instructions - feet up, feet down. On the other arms up, arms down.  Bar isn't very stable.  Company should save the money they spent putting in the tutu and slippers and create a more helpful mat.  My daughter will press the music button on the mat and then dance off it. 
True to its name it has high sensitivity. Too much that on a very smooth surface this mouse becomes live.Start moving in all directions. ---  --- On my couch the mouse is dead. --- If the surface is smooth the mouse laser is too sensitive. --- But when the surface is soft or rough the mouse gets stuck. The paws/foot of the mouse is sticky. ---  --- Not sure if this is a defective but really hate this mouse.... --- I am returning this product. ---  --- Even at the slowest speed it is difficult to click a checkbox on the screen. --- 
For the price, I expected a toy. I was surprised to open the box and find an honest to goodness classical guitar. The construction, fit and finish are impeccable. The sound is certainly not concert quality, but that is to be expected on a $50 dollar instrument. The tuning is reasonably accurate, and it is a pleasure to play. I have told me son about it and he is going to buy one for his son.
A wonderful version of Sinbad the Sailor. Great sets, costumes, and story line. Douglass Fairbanks is great in it
I like the GTA series of games and this one is great too. I can turn up my settings to max (My computer is over a year old) and there are no problems. The kid reviewer claims that he doesn't like the "N/F bomb". That is why this is rated M for Mature (so he should not even be playing it). To give the series a taste some things cannot be eliminated. ---  --- This is a fun games just exploring the city or completing missions
Actually, I loved the Philips Acoustic Edge, an earlier and internal sound card, but it did not like my older dual-processor system.  Because of that I was a bit skittish about using their current internal card with a processor that uses hyper-threading - which Windows treats as dual processors.  I bought the Aurelium instead.  I love this thing!  I am a bit of an audiophile, and this sound card is just perfect.  With my Klipsch computer speakers, it makes a perfect combination
The last ball I had requirted the bicycle pump to fill it. I'm just too lazy to run out and find the bike pump every time I need a little more air. The pump that comes with this ball doubles for filling other things too. At my kids birthday party I used it to fill some inflatable decorations and I've used it to fill an air mattress. So two things: the ball is easily inflated and the pump is handy
I purchased this from Amazon based on the description that a long lasting rechargeable battery was included.  However when it arrived, there was no battery.  Upon questioning Amazon about the battery, the customer service rep said he could give me a $5 credit for the batteries.  I asked how the battery could only be worth $5.  He said that is what AA rechargeable batteries go for. The bag is ok, but don't order this if you are expecting a battery specifally made for compact printers
This series may be good for a laugh. Some of the writing is engaging.  ---  --- But the premise is absurd.  ---  --- WHY, in this day and age, should anyone accept the world-view of the Bible? A book that tells us to buy and sell slaves, stone our wives to death if they accept some other tribe's beliefs, and subordinate our minds to an absolute despot up in the clouds of Mt. Sinai?  ---  --- In a sense, Bible believers have been "left behind" since the 1700s Enlightenment. Tom Paine's "The Age of Reason" showed the God of the Bible to be a cruel, vindictive monster. And what did Thomas Jefferson call the book of Revelations? "The ravings of a madman."  ---  --- Read this series, if you like. Enjoy parts of it. But make no mistake: to take any of this seriously, you have to regress to a prehistoric world-view, before men learned to think, to ask questions; before logic or science -- a time when dazed, superstitious primitives believed stars could fall to the earth, if they didn't grovel humbly enough to their supposed god.  ---  --- Do the absurdities and contradictions bother no one? When the "sheep" are raptured up to heaven, their clothes are left behind. So heaven is a nudist colony?  ---  --- The basic contradiction, of course, lies in using worldly action (some of it exciting) to proselytize for the unworldly, the supernatural.  ---  --- But why should we care whether any of the "good" guys gets killed? And why should THEY mind -- won't they go straight up to heaven? That's what they WANT, isn't it? Why even lift a finger against the "bad" guys -- didn't Christ say, "Resist not evil"?  ---  --- Worried about who will win? "God" is infinitely powerful. So Jesus (who is 1/3 of God -- or something like that) is sure to win when Armageddon rolls around, in book 12 of the series. And the "sheep" -- the believers -- will happily worship him, looking just like the pictures of dim-witted, bovine people you see in the tracts Jehovah's Witnesses leave at your door.  ---  --- The going price for a used copy of "Tribulation Force" is one cent. Does that tell you something?  ---  --- Actually, the story-telling is worth more. The basic premise is worth less. Perhaps it averages out
I love Pablo's act on Comedy Central.  This one doesn't even touch it
This Biscotti is just awful, too sweet and too hard.  La Tempesta is a real Biscotti
Having had Norton products installed for years including AntiVirus, Internet Security, and SystemWorks, I decided to replace the installed products with Norton 360 and a non-Norton password manager.  Obviously, it is critical to FIRST remove all Norton programs before installing Norton 360.  The installation process proceeded relatively smoothly. ---  --- My computing environment includes a 1.6Ghz processor, 1,000MB of memory, and 6GB of available disk.   ---  --- The background scans and LiveUpdate have played havoc with my other applications by periodically locking up the entire CPU at 100% CPU utilization.  One application that streams radio broadcasts now stops.  I immediately disabled the automatic updates and scheduled backups, however, the CPU occasionally still locks.   ---  --- Additionally, there is no way to transfer security settings from previous Norton products to Norton 360 thereby making the installation process very labor intensive. ---  --- If you now have separate Norton security products and are satisfied with them, save your money and renew the Norton subscriptions.
I recently bought a pair of the reflector cover from photoblocker store on Amazon.  After I put it on my plates I have been through several red light intersections in the evenings on numerous occasions and to date I have yet to receive a fine, I believe the reflector cover has already paid for itself.
Great fun way to practice chipping in my backyard.  It provides a great way of having a backyard practice chipping game with my friends.  Another product that I found quite valuable is ---  --- "The Ultimate Golf Instruction Guide: Key Techniques for Becoming a Zero Handicap Golfer or Better" by Patrick Leonardi --- This book has very practical information on the short game and long game, which lead to my improvement on the golf range and on the golf course.   ---  --- For leisure reading, I also suggest --- "New Rules: Polite Musings from a Timid Observer"  by Bill Maher --- This book is hilarious, very funny observations about famous people in the world
I only paid 39.99 and it was still a rip-off.  It says it's 1 inch by 1 inch, but it's about the size of a dime!!!  So dissappointed.  Sending it back
This package is very complete and easy to use.  Took just a few minutes to be drawing house layouts, et.  A lot of the tools are intuitive and simple
This is a great watch for people who are trying their hand at outdoor sports.  It is easy to use and not too bulky.  Wish is was made of a more durable material other than plastic, but like I mentioned it is great for a beginner to practice.  It has all of the main functions of watches costing much more so it does the job.  It is a very clean and smart looking watch
Its tough to beat the price of these 1/2 ct. diamonds for $199; they looked really good and the wife loved them.  The only reason I gave 4 stars is because they only have non-screw backs and they didn't come with a diamond spec sheet to verify what you got.  But for the price, a minor quibble... you won't be disappointed with your purchase
It's the best product I've used to create volume and hold.  I didn't notice it after blow drying, but, while using the curling iron and styling - my hair had a lot more volume and great hold.  I have straight, fine, limp hair and it is very difficult to get it to hold a style.  I truely noticed a big difference.  I plan to purchase the other volumizing products, once they are in stock.
Very fun I love it is like a dream in a book the wings do fall of but not often. what I say is YES get it
I purchased three of these for three Kodak easyshare cameras --- I gave as gifts. It was a great buy for much less than what --- you can get at any local stores
Amazing program! Definitely building my skills in the interior design field. Would recommend to anyone
I bought two of these trikes for my 19 month old twin sons.  Within the first 10 minutes of use, they both tipped over numerous times.  They tipped over when they were trying to use the pedals and also when they were just using their feet on the floor. Definitely not a sturdy trike.  My husband and I were very disappointed and returned them immediately. ---  --- In reading other reviews, I see that our experience with these trikes is not unique
This toy is not what I had expected. It isn't very durable at all and it's HARD to put together! I don't highly recommend it
I had to return this item because it was too short for the side of my tub.  I would have to kneel on the knee pad to make it stretch and then sometimes the elbow pad would pop off.  I ended up trying it by just removing the stretch fabric and elbow pad, but then it became just an expensive knee stool.  The knee stool portion of this product was the only useful part to me and that is why I give it 2 stars rather than 1.  I returned it because you can get just the kneel stool from other companies for half the price
I gave this game to my 13 year old nephew for Christmas.  He actually wrote me a thank you note for it.  In the note he said "I like it better than normal Monoply.  There's a lot more thinking and strategy involved".  I might even go up to five stars
Motor Trend never fails to deliver. I like the fact that they cover such a wide variety of vehicles, everything from SUVs, CUVs, trucks, sportscars, import "tuners", sub-compacts, high-priced exotics, concepts and rumors. The news is fresh and accurate, the issues arrive on time, the mags are thick, pics are crisp, letters are interesting and articles provide usefull information
I have used These Seagate Drives for almost 2 years now. They work nicely for editing movies, and I like the combo Firewire and USB2.0 interface. I trust these cheaper Seagate than the expensive LACIE (we bought a box full of lacie D2, they ALL fail in 6 months) or store brand drives. Hard drives are prone to failure. But Seagate has served my company well. ---  --- using : Seagate 750GB, 500GB, 400GB. daisy chained.... --- 
On paper, the idea of a 24 video game sounds like a great idea, and upon first glance of it, it seems like it's firing on all cylinders.  Featuring all the major players from the series reprising their roles (Kiefer Sutherland, Dennis Haysbert, Elisa Cuthbert, etc.) and a storyline and tone and atmosphere that captures the feel of the show, 24: The Game falls apart once you get further into it.  The missions are repetitive, the animation and graphics are jumpy and glitched, and the controls are unresponsive to say the least.  Targeting enemies is a chore at times as you use the analog sticks, but the targeting along with just plain moving gets incredibly cumbersome thanks to a camera that seems to want to work against you.  Some of this could be forgiveable, but the further you get through 24 the more rushed the game feels.  It's a shame too, considering how innovative the series was in it's early life and everything the game had going for it.  If more polish was put into it, 24: The Game could have been something special, but as it is, it's only recommended as a rental for fans of the series
I have an ICS M4A1.  I am basing my thoughts on this based on what some of the airsoft forums I am registered to have said on this.  I am registered on Arnies, Airsoft Core, and Airsoft Retreat. ---  --- 1) This gun is from a very, very unreliable company (Well), so you have more chances of getting a bad gun than you do for getting a good one.  This is common knowledge among the airsoft community. ---  --- 2) Lets say you buy 4 of these guns... each of them costing 100 dollars.  Even over a 5-10 year span, that adds up to a lot of money being spent on a gun that breaks consistantly.  People who have skirmished with an LPEG (Low-Powered Electric Gun) find that the exterior can actually break if shot at with an AEG that shoots 330 FPS with .2g (standard for companies like Toyko Marui, ICS, Classic Army, G&G, Airsoft Elite).  The one thing that this suggests that the gun is badly made. ---  --- 3) The gearbox (part of gun that fires bbs) broke on mine.  In short, it has a metal gearbox, made of the cheapest metal known to man.  The purpose of this for the company that makes to this get money.  It is very, very weak.  Definitely not worth it. ---  --- 4) The "Hop-Up" on this gun is non-existant.  The fundamentals of hop-up is a backspin is added to BBs to increase range and accuracy.  Effective range of this- 50 feet (not meters).  Effective range of my ICS M4A1 (with a aftermarket tightbore added) is 150 feet. ---  --- 5) This gun will get laughed at.  Some children walk into an organized skirmish with this LPEG, telling people that it will own all others, and they will cry home when players with real AEGS destroy them.  I suppose it is fine for backyard wars, but who on Earth would spend 100 dollars for a crappy gun for backyard wars? ---  --- 6) The cost does not equal quality.  If you think about all of the accessories that come with this gun (light, laser, ect), then account for shipping from CHINA, then the packaging costs (pre-molded styrofoam), you will realize that this gun is very, very cheaply made.  You do not want to be spending so much for so little quality.  The laser itself can sell for 20 dollars. ---  --- Put it short, it is not worth it
This album bores me out of my mind. Only two decent tracks: Bad boys and Bonnie and Clyde. And I'm no avid radio listener. BET and MTV actually hit the nail on the head with these tracks. So i guess they good for somethin
These are by far the BEST newborn size diapers especially for small babies, but if you order them through Amazon, your baby may outgrow them before they even arrive!  I waited 5 weeks then cancelled the order and ordered size 1, which Actually arrived in a few days! ---  --- Update: I have ordered Pampers again through Amazon (different size) and they shipped right away
This machine literally broke within the first 15 minutes after it had been assembled, I couldn't believe it.  My advice would be to avoid this product
I purchased this hairdryer after my professional Conair Yellowbird from the late 70's broke.  I definitely wanted another Conair and I wanted to move into the 21st Century!  I did the research and this hairdryer had the most features for the best price.  I wasn't disappointed.  As the other reviewers have stated, this hairdryer dries your hair in half the time!  It's also nice to reduce the static in your hair when you want to freshen up and are "dry brushing" your hair.  It does draw a lot of power when on high heat and the highest blowing setting and the lights in my dressing room will dim.  Otherwise, it is very solidly built and I hope to have this hairdryer for another 30 years.
This did not help my skin AT ALL. I would not reccomend it to anyone! Save your money!
I've been using a Mac for the last 10+ years and I had assumed that Windows had gotten better since Win 94.  Boy was I wrong.  It amazes me that the entire world runs on this awful excuse for an OS.
I bought these skates for my daughter from Sport Authority.  Since we both wear the same size, I decided I would try and skate in them after my daughter.  She complained the wheels would not roll and when I tried to loosen them with a skate tool, they wouldn't loosen at all.  I tried to skate in them as well and I almost fell on my face.  I wasn't expecting the same quality as my professional skates, but at least hoped for skates that rolled safely!
Kissaluvs are the best! They keep baby dry while being incredibly breathable.  Baby's skin doesn't get red like it does with disposable diapers.  Also great for keeping in those wonderful breastmilk poops.
For the first couple of weeks the Snack Trap worked perfectly. After that, my daughter (7 months old) figured out how to remove the top (it is just a soft plastic cover like a tupperware, but easily removed), and we have since been struggling to keep her from dumping, throwing, or shaking the snacks all around the house. ---  --- On the positive side, the flaps for the top are very soft, and when she does reach in, there is no worry about her harming her hands or fingers. If only the lid had a locking mechanism or was screwed on, then this would work perfectly. As it is, my daughter loves it, but we hate cleaning up the mess
As a lover of gospel bluegrass I anticipated an enjoyable listening session with Blue Highway's latest offering. Let me first say that I am a fan of this group, which I consider to be one of the premier groups in bluegrassdom, but what I heard was bluegrass Muzak. Yes, the group's tight harmonies and excellent musicianship were in evidence, and that is what saved this disc from being sold to the local reseller, but the lack of inspiration and excitement was disappointing. Gospel music, even bluegrass Gospel, has a tendency to preachiness and taking itself too seriously as this disc proves. A good Gospel recording MUST have some cuts which are humorous, some serious and contemplative, some that push the envelope of orthodoxy, and most importantly it must have an element of FUN in order to keep the attention of the listeners. This disc fails in that regard containing standard old Gospel chestnuts along with some original songs that ape the oldtime standards. My advice is to either borrow it from a friend before buying new, or buy used. Want mine
This is not your father's business magazine. Picked it up for the first time in a doctor's office and stole the issue (on real estate)
The earrings were exactly what I wanted.  The delivery date was as promised. 
This griddle is very useful, especially if you bring your grill to the camp site.  The surface cooks evenly and if sufficiently heated does a good job.   ---  --- At first I thought it was solid cast iron but upon further inspection found that it has some kind of high temperature coating.  My only criticism is that it isn't a more non-stick surface and food can be hard to clean off after use. ---  --- The gee whiz factor is great when you whip it out around other people who have the little stamped metal travel grills.  This item really rounds out the Baby Q's options.   --- 
These are absolutely the most fashionable and adorable shoes on earth. They are right on the mark. I love them so much that I am ordering my second pair..not because the first fell apart, but because I simply have to have more than one pair
I bought this product in the color Paparazzi from Sephora - online, I read wonderful reviews about it in the magazines.  I was very disappointed when I finally got it and tried it. There is way too much glitter in it for anyone over 13.  I could not wear this to work or even an evening out as I would feel like a clown.  The only place this would look semi-good at would be a nightclub where it is dark. I was hoping for more of a shimmer than pure glitter.  I do not recommend this product at all. I also returned this promptly back to Sephora.     
Returned item, as was leaking all over. Great product if Amazon had packed it better, I could have used it
Its a great product it coats when it rains when you just put it on you dont even need to use the wipers but it does take some work to make sure its not smeared looking.   Clean your glass good with windex first then apply and polish off. I dont really buy any of those as seen on TV items but this is the first one that really works well also if you side windows squeak this will help with that as well since is a slippery it will help with weather stripping.  Remember this works best when over about 40mph... and you will have to keep reapplying a few times a yea
Nothing. Not even a trailer. What a wasted opportunity for a commentary by West (who does do them -- he did one for When A Stranger Calls) or a retrospective featurette. ---  --- All you do get with this extended version is additional dialogue between Cusack's character and a female law enforcement officer in a hanger, footage of a prison riot during the opening credits montage and a few more graphic shots of hapless inmates being killed during the course of the movie
It's good to see that in his twilight years, old squinty eyes, Clint Eastwood is growing comfortable playing grouchy old dudes, because, well, he is a grouchy old dude. This movie is anemic from the beginning. Taken from a wonderful novel by Michael Connelly, Clint plays an old grouchy dude who's just gotten a new ticker because his last one gave out while chasing a serial killer. Run, run, run, THUD. Next, new ticker intact, Clint is hired to find the murderer of a cute black woman by her sister, another cute black woman. Oh, and CBW#2 plays the guilt card on Clint, because he's got his new ticker courtesy of CBW#1. So there's a little bit of investigative work, a little but of huffin' and a puffin', and finally Clint discovers who the serial killer is who was responsible for his first ticker giving out and the murder of the donor of his second ticker. Jeff Daniels plays a doofus that lives next door to Clint. What a stretch. Special warning: Clint takes off his shirt yet again in this film as he smooches on CBW#2. It must be in his contract or something. No one, and I mean, NO ONE wants to see saggy Clint with his shirt off. For a much, much better Clint movie, go rent "Unforgiven"
I just bought this cd because I am learning Haitian creole, and that's one of the languages that is supposed to be on this cd. When I installed it, I was unable to find anything on the CD in Haitian creole, even though it is listed as one of the languages on the case. So it has been a complete waste of money for me, perhaps if I was interested in the other languages I could give it more stars. --- It also says in the blurb that u can use any of the 16 languages as the source language, but that is not possible either, u can only chooose a few of the languages as your source. I am very disappointed in the false advertising for this product. If anyone can find creole on this cd I would be happy to stand corrected. --- PS I contacted IMSI and they say the cd's were mislabelled, there is no haitian creole on the cd, despite the fact that it is listed on the cover
I think there was packaging or a sticker that compared this film to Pulp Fiction.  As if.  Beyond minor superficial similarities - I dont see it. ---  --- Le Samurai is one of the most boring films Ive watched recently without turning it off.  In retrospect I wish I had turned it off or never wasted my time since the ending is so dull.   ---  --- Imagine if breathless had a slightly more complicated plot, but the main character had no charisma.  Or if Alphaville (the film not the treatment) was more 100 times more boring.  Le Samurai makes Tokyo Drifter seem like a thrill ride.  I was not impressed by this film on any level. ---  --- If you are into being bored.  Or if your so freaking smart you can watch paint drying and fill it with significance, this is the film for you
I'm a diehard Nikon fan.  My first Nikon was a gift from my father when I was 13.  Since then, photography has been a serious hobby, having had a few photos published and even spent time working in a photo lab while in college.  Having said that, and after reading several reviews about people having trouble focusing this camera, I absolutely agree with them.  Someone responded by saying those reviewers haven't read the manual.  Baloney.  I bought the Coolpix L1 to replace a 4 year old Coolpix 850.  The L1's camera's focus feature works fine in the daylight and works for s**t indoors, especially with the macro settings.  I've been patient and have given it three months.  I am fed up.  This camera is going back to amazon in the morning
At least this author mentions the "mockery" strategy Martha/Mdiddy tried to use to "fog" the public. The "real issue" of whether Martha/Mdiddy committed the crimes, and lack of an effort to encourage an answer to the question "DID MARTHA STEWART" lie, demonstrates some complacency. Is it this complacency Martha/Mdiddy and her pr team try to encourage and promote? Is it the "greyness" of white-collar crime that Martha/Mdiddy was trying to play on? Is society the ultimate judge about a person's guilt or innocence? If so, what has Martha/Mdiddy been judged? --- Be "thoughtful" --- ~Shaw
Toy makes EXTREMELY loud animal noises, along with a screeching motor when backing up or at top speed going forward.  My son enjoyed the heck out of it for about 2 minutes before my wife said it was going back to the store, which is exactly what I was thinking. ---  --- At least 3-4x louder than any other toy i've ever seen, let alone purchased. ---  --- Also when performing its "flip" maneuver, it gets stuck 70% of the time and then makes the same screeching motor sound while it repeatedly tries to reset its "flip arm". ---  --- Might be okay for just outside use if you can stand a lot of high pitched noise. ---  --- Controller was extremely toddler friendly compared to other RC toys.  Toy also seemed fairly tough.
I love this pendant. Very shiny and substantial - the back looks as good as the front.  I also wear this on a black leather cord (16") and it gives it a whole new look.  Great buy
I was eager to read this book, but after reading it I was left completely flat.  The rest of the iceberg?  Hardly. ---  --- Smith barely gives us more than what we could get from reading Sports Illustrated, or any Minnesota sports page.  He admits he's not a fan of football, but for the majority of the book leisurely describes the most basic parts of his football career.   ---  --- This book is touted as: his full and complete story.  So we learned he was watching Ren & Stimpy during his NFL Draft.  Wow, are these the types of meaty stories that we want to read? ---  --- How about telling us more of the inside details...  How did Smith deal with people who wanted to be his friends or girlfriends only because he was a star football player?  Who were his friends that he could trust, and when did he need that trust?  What thoughts enter your mind as you look to hire an agent?  What was he doing when he was "goofing off and missing class all summer" which led to one of the most covered stories of his time at Ohio State?  When, and why did he begin using pot?  If football is not "smart" enough for him, why doesn't he study and break down some of the coaching process that is more mentally challenging?  What happened to plans for medical school?  We know the stories of football; those are the parts of the iceberg that have already been documented. ---  --- I also felt Smith wrote this book as if he is defending himself from all of America.  Who is attacking him?  Why does he feel the need to explain why he was paid so much?  Highly paid athlete stories are, sorry for the pun, a dime a dozen.  He tries to compare his sitting out for more money to a scenario for the average guy.  The truth is, many people will take a job for 5% less than a co-worker because yes, they value things other than money, and yes, they are happy to have a job.   ---  --- Leaving the grammatical errors to the other reviewers, it felt like I was reading an average high school creative writing project.  'I did this, I did that, I went to bed, next day.'  Half of his quotes are from the wellspring of deep philosophy: pop music.  Smith notes "less than 50 percent of Americans read at a 10th-grade level".  Well, this book certainly won't tax the reading ability of too many people. ---  --- One lesson from this book is that Smith had opportunities to swallow his pride, take some coaching, and come up with a better solution.  This book is another one of those times.  He should have hired an editor or writing consultant who could give guidance.  Build the characters; help us feel their stories.  Instead, Smith felt it necessary to go alone to get to the raw emotions.  Sorry, but compared to other autobiographies, this was not an emotional book. ---  --- I'm sure Smith is all the things that Mike Gutter says he is, such as: thoughtful, honest, trustworthy, dependable, passionate...  but I felt that some of the best stories that would demonstrate these characteristics were left out of this book.   ---  --- Instead, we are still looking for the rest of the iceberg.
I have subscribed to "In Touch" since September last year and it's time to renew, but I'm not goint to....because this megazine is never arrived on time (at least 5 of them just failed to arrive), I don't know wether i should wait for it or call customer service. I would go to the store and buy it instead because the megazine itself is very entertaining.  
My two year old has several of these cars, and the race track. He loves all things Cars, so these were a big hit. All of the Shake and Go Cars talk before they run, which he especially likes. They are VERY easy for a toddler to operate, but his four year old sister enjoys playing with them, too. They don't run for very long per shake, but that doesn't seem to bother him at all
I purchased this product about 2 months ago, the resolution is not the best but it's acceptable. After a month,it turned off by itself and wouldn't turn on again!! I sent it to repair and had to pay $50.00 !!!somenthing to do with the power button. I have it on a UPS with battery, also freezes for no reason. I don't recomend it
I must have missed something about this book.  I can't believe that Minority Report and Total Recall, two movies that I did enjoy, came from this author.  The stories seem to be missing something.  Perhaps, this version should not have been the first works by this author for me to have read
I bought this curling iron impulsively, as I perused through the "gold box" items some time ago.  When I first received the it, I was amazed at how well it worked; it heated up quickly, and did a wonderful job on my hair.  After a couple months, I turned it on, left the room for a minute, and came back to find the tip melted off, hanging from a strand of what little plastic was still attached.  I thought about returning it, but decided (rather stupidly, in retrospect) to continue to use it...BIG MISTAKE.  It heated up way beyond what it should have, even when I put it at a "low" setting of 5.  When I attempted to use it, the sizzling sound indicated to me that I had, indeed, made a mistake.  The next day, coworkers were commenting on my lovely new SHORT haircut.  If you're really interested in purchasing this item, please learn from my mistake, and if the tip melts off, take that as a sign that it will also melt your hair
I am so greatfull to this pump! I was able to exclusively breastfeed two children for a year each, while working full time, taking vacations (without the kids), etc. I also have the car adapter which is awesome, I was able to pump to and from my work, (which is over an hour away), while driving. I only recommend that for breatfeeding/pumping pros! The warranty is only good for a year, but mine is now three years old and still going strong. We are expecting our third child and I hope my pump holds up for another year, if not I will still probably spend the money on another pump like this one! Best of luck
I find these ear buds to be absolutely uncomfortable. I would rate the product a zero if it were an option. I can't even use them because they're too uncomfortable to wear. Not worth the money, even though they're cheap
Help!  This program will not let me print all of my address's unto christmas labels.  When you go down to the arrow to check all address's it will not move.  Any Help would be appreciated. ---  --- Thank
That's right!  A quote from Detective Eames on Law & Order:  Criminal Intent.  She and Goren were in a garage and she pointed out a chamois cloth and smelled it and that's when she said, "Meguiar's, the good stuff.  My father used to use it on his ..." --- The first time I saw that episode I didn't know what she was talking about.  But I saw it the other day (on Bravo) and I got it!  That's because I have become an avid fan of Meguiar's products since I bought a Mercedes 7 months ago!   --- This product I mostly use on the interior.  It is like a magnet for wiping the dash and wood trim.  You hardly need the sprays but they are good too.  Keep one handy in your glove comparment. --- It gives a great shine on the outside whey you use it with Meguiar's Quik Detailer Spray. Enjoy
Sooo cute.  Santa gave my 7 y.o. daughter the dog and cat versions of this game.  She and I have already spent several hours playing with her "pets".  Unlike the earlier pets, there is more to do than just care for your pet.  There are games, activities and interactions with pet friends.  There is a whole village of homes and places to visit.   ---  --- You collect stickers throughout your adventures.  For instance there are 29 stickers available for making friends.  It is represented by a heart sticker.  Everytime you collect a sticker, you are taken to your sticker book and it indicates how many stickers are available and how many you have obtained.   ---  --- There are three exterior buttons for use to play with, groom and feed your pet.  When your pet ignores you, it means it is time for grooming, playing or eating.   ---  --- Sometimes your pet will suddenly disappear and then reappear at their potty mat having left a little undesirable.  My daughter thinks that is hilarious.  Kids!   ---  --- The only drawback is that the screen does not light up for play while travelling after dark.  Maybe they'll improve upon that in the next versions
My son is enthralled with this game!  He is learning while being entertained.  The graphics are exceptional, music is great, situations are complex and challenging and it works on the MAC!  What more could we ask for
Hi, I just recently purchased this phone. and so far these are the problems. Yes you do have to restart the device, it does get hung, but i don't blame the phone, after all it has windows mobile 5 in it. The restart has occurred twice to me in the past week, So be careful. This phone is pretty close to being perfect. Other than the fact that it has windows, The 3G connection is crazy fast and it is amazing to have. If you take this phone be ready to take a good data connect plan as even thought it has wifi capabilities, Cingular has programed it to first connect to their data connect feature.. which in return will give u a nice thick bill.. Once you buy the phone i suggest that  you get this software Spb Pocket plus. It helps shutting down softwares running in the background, and adds more features. The screen clarity is amazing and it has great features. It can connect up to 6 bluetooth devices at once. Overall i give it a 4 because of the hardware. the one star missing is cause it has Windows. Sorry Microsoft but you need to remove the bugs outta this windows too.
Cooks illustrated rated this product the best and so do I. I purchased two as gifts, one for my husband and one for my son-in-law for fathers day. Both are extreamly pleased with the product.
I saw this movie in the 1986 theatrical re-release and subsequently on DVD. I can readily attest that it does not age! I'm not even a dog person myself, but the plot is not about dogs per say, but the life adventures that a young cocker spaniel named Lady has.  ---  --- Living with owners named Darling and Jim Dear, Lady apparently leads a pretty good life. Assuming that every dog leads the good life she and her friends enjoy, she is later shocked to meet Tramp, who lives on the streets. However, she soon realizes that he has a good heart beneath that rough exterior.  ---  --- She needs his help when crusty old Aunt Sarah comes to mind the house--and the newborn baby. Initially not understanding that Lady feels protective towards the baby, she also selectively ignores the damage which her two Siamese cats were actually responsible for doing to that very elaborate Victorian house.  ---  --- Amazingly, Aunt Sarah presumes that Lady was responsible for wrecking the house--and attempts to muzzle her up! ---  --- Like any streetwise character, Tramp has lots of connections and solutions to any problem which pops up. However, he does not come across as an annoying know-it-all who you would want to quickly get rid of. Tramp is instead somebody whom we are supposed to both identify and then want to hang out with in rough environments. Lady had 'gentle' friends named Jock and Trusty, but they can't help out in a world also outside of their own.    ---  --- Of course, the spaghetti dinner scene remains one of the most enduring of all time--it made a VERY profound impact on me well before I was even old enough to myself consider dating. I imagined that I would eventually share a romantic dinner of my own with my own "Mr. right".  ---  --- However, Tramp's decision to go after the rat in the nursery also remains a powerful scene. He then felt no loyalty to anybody in that family other than Lady, but saved the baby anyway! Tramp proved that class is not a matter of breeding but what you do with your self!  ---  --- Despite his earlier professed discomfort with collars, Tramp ultimately gets adopted by the Darlings. Therefore, he and Lady do in fact live happily ever after. ---  
Over the years, I have tried many different brands and types of heated rollers and I never liked using any of them.  I recently bought a new set which I had to return due to the fact that I had a terrible time trying to roll my hair on the almost smooth surface of the rollers and then after clipping the rolls, they would immediately fall out of my hair....scream! I bought the Remmington #1080N wax core roller set and I have finally found the easiest and quickest  way to curl my hair.  The rollers surface, when warm, grab the hair ends immediately to allow great control when trying to roll even short hair.  The rollers are held in place by a full clip which looks more like a comb so the clips do not leave a ridge in my hair.  Once heated, the rollers are relatively cool to the touch (no more burned fingers) but due to the wax core, the rollers hold plenty of     heat and it takes just a few minutes after setting to produce excellent, long lasting results.  The set takes about 10 - 15 minutes to warm up.  I've found the warm up time takes longer than the time I actually leave the curlers in my hair.  This is the Best curler set I have EVER used.  If I was to ask for one change, it would be a quicker warm up time.  However, just the fact that rolling is so quick and easy, makes up for the few extra minutes of preparation.  I'm hard to please, so my recommendation says alot.  Thanks Remmington (I still don't like your other regular rollers! Ha)
I remember managing to find a drive-in that was showing the first run ECEG; and I remember my girlfriend not saying a word while we watched. She was too kind. In retrospect, it was so totally wrong for the time that one almost has to respect it. I say almost. It was a numbing experience then and the most one can say for it now is: At least the Elvis impersonators will leave it alone. The story is weak, the co-stars are painful, and the soundtrack so bad, the weakest selling record of Elvis' career managed to kill of the Extended Playing record. But , for all that, it is Elvis, and the true beliver will find something in it worth carrying away. Its just best watched alone.
This CD Is garbage. Juvenile should go hang him self after putting out this album. He was alright when he first came out but now he sucks the big one. If I was you dont listen to the retards who tell you "this is a good comeback album" . Instead of wasting you cah on this crap i recommend Welcome Back by Mase. That is a good comeback album. The only thing that makes the album even worth noting is the beats of Mannie Fresh. Juvenile just was a waste of those excellent beats. A shame they couldn't go to Ja rule, whose CD sucked with his beats. He has the vocal and writing talent but his beats blow
This is worthless and they say it's refundable, until you read the fine print and realize it's only if you bought the entire product line. It is crap and doesn't do anything. Don't waste your money, drink milk and your hair will grow. This does not work
I love these jeans -- I have 3 pair and they are the only jeans I wear.  Just enough stretch to be comfy but not too tight.  I wear a size 14 and these jeans fit me great. 
Please don't expect to get the cash back from this purchase as promised!  To date, I've been denied twice.  The second time they said the U P C number was invalid. Only, it's the original U P C barcode!  I was meticulous filing the paperwork, yet they state, "All required products were not submitted."  Meanwhile, I have phoned AMAZ0N to lodge a formal complaint. ---  --- The product itself is average.  I've used better and worse.  That said, it's definitely not worth the full asking price
I find this product, easy to implement, train users, and monitor,manage any small business
I love this show.  It is well-written, superbly cast and always fun to watch.  I highly recommend!
Its kind of hard to deny what Krs-One has brought to the game. His flow is phenomenal and the insight he gives is precious even now. Standout Tracks: DUCK DOWN, RUFF RUFF(dope match up with Freddie Foxx), 13 AND GOOD(the story of a guy who sleeps with a teen that calls her father who is a gay cop will have you in stitches), POISONOUS PRODUCTS, QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS, LIKE A THROTTLE, WE IN HERE, THE REAL HOLY PLACE(the deepest track on here), WHO ARE THE PIMPS? and the reggae tinged joints like SAY GAL and SEX AND VIOLENCE are gems also. Filler: NONE! Bottom Line: BDP's six album is still a classic with a message that still isnt heeded till this day. Besides the slammin production, Krs showed that he was 100 steps ahead from the average rapper with this album. Any born again hip hop head would do well to start off with Edutainment and work their way down to this album.
This puzzle (also known as Rubik's Revenge) is good fun - and because it has another layer of movement, it is much more likely to fall apart than the 3x3x3 cube. However, the puzzle of reassembly is also quite fun - and requires no force! A clue to reassembly - make sure that the last two pieces are the same colour edge pieces - and they will (very gently) snap into place.  A second clue: only the centre pieces (four flats pieces on each side) fit into the grooves of the ball - be gentle, and your cube will be as good as new. Start with the four centre pieces of one colour at the bottom - and build up the cube layer by layer. Remember! No force
This is a great product.  It actually fits into my ear properly and I can hear clearly through it.  It is easy to operate and the charge last for many days.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for an earpiece that fits comfortably and is just the right size
This may work well, but the cuff size is not as it is in the description. It says this will work on an arm circumference of up to 18 inches. Not even close. My arm is a little under 13 inches and was too large for the cuff by far. Sure, you can get the cuff to go around your arm, but there are indications on the cuff that have to line up for it to work properly, and there was just no way to even come close
Juliette Binoche is an amazing actress.  Since her Best Supporting Actress Oscar for "The English Patient" in 1996 and her nomination for "Chocolat," she's an actress whose films I seek.  "The Widow of Saint-Pierre" has a bit of irony to the title.  The opening frames show Binoche in black staring out of a window.  We then move into the flashback in which most of the film moves forward.  We learn that the "widow" is the guillotine that must be shipped by boat from France before the big execution can take place.  We see director Emir Kusturica in an acting role as the very large prisoner Neel whose rehabilitation Binoche's Madame La seeks.  We keep wondering if the black dress is saved for the prisoner.  Daniel Autereil who won a Cesar (French Oscar) for his work with director Patrice Leconte for "Ridicule" in 1996 plays the lovestruck Captain who is in charge of the execution.  Spurred on by his wild and unconditional love for his wife, he thwarts the town's sentence of death at every turn, refusing to allow his soldiers to help haul the widow ship to shore.  In the moment of ultimate irony, Neel volunteers to help bring the widow to shore, which is sure to result in his own execution.  The bloody resolution and the final shots of Binoche in black bring the story to its somber conclusion.  Patrice Leconte has a great reserve, shooting this excellent screenplay in period costume and letting the depth of his cast work its magic.  This is an incredibly tragic romance, one that works exquisitely.  Enjoy! 
The size is good but the second one we ordered leaked. The cap did not fit... The after taste is not so strong but very difficult to see the difference from an ordinary stainless steel container/warmer which costs only $6-$10 dollars in the market around. Too pricy and the thin plastic cap does not match well with the product
I write with Noodler's Black (the brand's "standard" black ink) almost every day because I can't always choose the paper to write on. Noodler's Black can be used for two-sided writing on bad paper, even newsprint, which is rare among all the fountain pen inks in the world. ---  --- I also write with Noodler's Black because it's waterproof, forgery-proof, good-looking, and pleasantly smooth during writing. I confidently write checks with Noodler's Black, and it is safe for signing valuable or important documents too (when black is an acceptable color; ask your lawyer). ---  --- Please keep in mind that the Noodler's company carefully says which of the brand's colors are waterproof and which are not. In my experience Noodler's Black is by far the best Noodler's color for writing on both sides of bad paper. ---  --- One behavior you might notice, if your pen's nib is an exposed metal surface (not covered with colored enamel), is that Noodler's (standard) Black spreads itself over exposed metal surfaces. This "nib creep" is harmless behavior because the ink doesn't run down onto the grip area. Wiping the ink off the nib is only temporary; more ink will soon spread to replace what you wiped off. Again, this is harmless behavior and a very small price to pay for the security of your marks, signatures and important handwritten texts
The shoes have sparkles all over and don't serve my purpose. I ordered them to use them for work but returned them because of the sparkle. A nice shoe to use during the night
The cherries are listed as "natural" on the packaging.  There is NOTHING natural about high fructose corn syrup.  I am returning them. --- 
These DO taste almost like the biscuits at Red Lobster.  They are so easy to make and so delicious! I have a muffin maker and they cook perfectly in about  10 minutes
If your toes get hot it has a zipper for that. (useless)  Better off getting a rectangular if you need more legroom.   ---  --- Its small (Even the long one)for a big guy.   ---  --- I wouldnt use it for anything but the summer (and you will most definatly need a good pad
I bought this from another retailer on "black Friday" for half of what Amazon is selling it for and I'm still bringing it back.  I think it's horrible.  I was so excited to get a mini-dv camcorder because I heard how great the picture was, but this takes horrible video. It comes out so dark that you can hardly see anything, even using the light.  Even in a fairly well-lit room it came out dark.  It looked Ok on the lcd screen, but when I hooked it up to the TV, horrible!  And it's not my TV either because I hooked up my old camcorder and it looked fine.  I love that it's so small, but if I can't see the video, it's no use to me.  Back to by big old Sony
I purchased this item as a gift for my son. He seems to think of them a very good gift and helps him to save his finger while he learns how to play the guitar
Okay, for all those who are fans of the Orwell classic, you have to understand how difficult this tale is to bring to the big or small screen.  We're dealing with talking animals relating to humans.  This tale is too deep for the "movie public" and ANY movie will fall short for true purists. ---  --- Taking it for what it is, it is an accurate depiction of the novel.  The reviewer who didn't see Moses the Raven in the story must have watched a different film. ---  --- It is really difficult to get people today to feel the horror of what Animal Farm represented when originally written.  Take that and put it under the Hallmark label and it can be just plain confusing for those who haven't read the novel. ---  --- I truly enjoyed this film.  I reccomend it for all.  Even if it is a little difficult to follow.  Unlike the box says, it is NOT for children
We all know how great the songs are on this CD -- 5-Star all the way. ---  --- However, I guess there's an unlucky few oddballs among us who can't play the SACD hybrid CD format of this particular reissue on our PC.  Which also means that we can't add the CD to our iTunes or iPod music selections.  In this day and age, that's severely limiting, so I regret this purchase (I don't have some jalopy of a PC/processor either, as my computer is less than seven months old, with 2GB of RAM). ---  --- I don't know who to blame for my "mistake" -- myself?  Amazon?  Sony?  Philips?  ABKCO? ---  --- I'll blame myself and be more careful next time -- in part by avoiding "DSD-" or "SACD-" labeled items. ---  --- I'll also give the CD 1 Star on the basis of its limited technological usefulness to me
If you're going to get the Baby Bjorn potty chair, you've got to get a matching stool!  I love how the stool has a rubbery-grip top to prevent slipping.  My son also uses the stool to read his books on while sitting in his matching potty chair.  You've gotta get one now
I rented this game before I bought and liked it so much I just had too buy it
I purchased my Leki Nordic Walking Poles because I read somewhere that these poles would reduce stress on my hips and knees while walking.  That is totally true!  I have a congenital malformation in my right hip which prevents me from ever being able to run or jog as a means for exercise.  I do love to walk, but was hindered by the pain from my right hip.  By using the walking poles, I am able to walk quickly without any pain at all, even though I am actually using more muscle groups than I would if walking without the use of poles.  Walking alone, a person only uses about 50% of the large muscle groups.  Walking with LEKI Nordic Walking poles, one will use up to 90% of all the large muscle groups; this turns a simple 30 minute walk into a full-body workout without stress!!  I would not walk any other way now that I own my LEKI poles!
I specifically bought Turbo Tax Premier because of stocks sales/purchases we made in 2006.  The section on stock income was confusing and it took me several times to figure out what information Turbo Tax wanted where.  When I thought I had it figured out and finished that section, I thought I would repeat it to make sure I did it right.  To my surprise, the second time I entered the information I received a different total than the first time.  So I did it a third time.  The third time matched the second, so I figured it must be right.  Then when I got to the section for error checking, I was told I had errors in my stock sales.  So I did it a forth time, which came out the same as the second and third time.  This time it passed the error checking, but instead of showing that we had purchased the stocks, Turbo Tax showed we had "inherited" the stocks.  I could not get Turbo Tax to change, so I printed out the form scratched out "inherited" and put in the date of purchase.  I would rather do my taxes by hand than use Turbo Tax again
Last year, I purchased the 5600 as an upgrade from my Nikon 2100. I am extremely upset over this purchase I have made, since it does not seem to take any good indoor pictures. The Nikon 2100 takes much better shots inside.  The indoor pics from this camera have an awkward yellow tint, and does not focus well. However, the outdoor shots are very clear and sharp. I tend to use this camera for all my outdoor pictures. The outdoor video works well on this camera too. I am giving this low one-star rating, since many events tend to be held indoors. This was definitely my final Nikon purchase ever
I bought this along with the butterfly pendant and 18" chain for a Christmas gift (06) for my god-daughter and she loves them both.  I loved the price!  The earrings are a perfect fit with the necklace.  She says she only wears them to church and special occasions.  A great gift for teenage girls
Do you have a birthday, anniversary, or other memorable occassion that is drawing near? If you do and you still haven't found that special someone a gift for the Gods, consider ripened ovaries. With their green hues and textured bodies, these ovaries should be at the top of everyone's gift list
I haven't finished this game, though I'm quite close to it. I have to say that this game is quite possibly the most fun that I've had in a long time. I laughed out loud more than a few times, was nearly constantly smiling, and was thoroughly amused with all the little details. Not much stylus action, but then again... did you really expect there to be?  ---  --- My boyfriend's highly considering getting a DS Lite simply so he can play this game.
The children in our after school program love this puzzle.  The colors are beautiful and they are learning about different sea creatures at the same time
What a disaster. Stay away from this film. I was so disappointed--how could this have won the Academy Award?! The story is rambling and confused, as if the filmmakers couldn't decide what story they wanted to tell. The animation is very average, with the exception of a few striking scenes of natural landscapes. In fact, those all-important "happy feet" of the main character just kind of jerk and slide around a bit. (That's supposed to be tap-dancing? that's supposed to be "animation?") The jokes aren't particularly funny (with the exception of a few moments in the middle where Robin Williams briefly shines). And oddly enough for a film whose central conceit centers on music and dancing, there's not a single original song, or even an inspired remake of any of the songs. Think "Billy Elliot" meets "The March of the Penguins" with some  of Gore's "An Inconvenient Truth" mixed in--without any of the wit, charm, intelligence, passion, or beauty in any of those films. (Did I mention that this film is a disaster?) ---  --- Perhaps most annoyingly, like the rest of the story, the underlying political message alternates between cliched, confused, and heavy-handed. The ending is especially unbearable, with its tacked-on feel and absurd psuedo-environmentalist feel-good solution. What a joke! Personally, I consider myself quite liberal and sympathetic to environmentalist positions (I've been a vegetarian for more than 20 years, and a member of Sierra Club and PETA, for example), yet the way this movie presents its misguided message offended me greatly--not least because of the utter inconsistency and incomprehensibility of the message. ---  --- One final note for those of you with children: this is not really a kids movie. Most of the jokes won't be understood by children under 15. For kids under 6, all this feeble film offers is some too-scary "Shamus" (orcas), a terrifyingly ferocious sea lion inexplicably made to growl like a dinosaur and given outsized teeth in a deformed mouth, and a jarring ending that suddenly switches to live-action scenes where adults heatedly debate environmental action in such kid-friendly forums as the United Nations! (What the heck?!) After sitting through the entire film to this point, my four-year-old son finally turned to me and quietly said, "This is not a movie for me."  I couldn't have agreed more
I ordered these for my husband for Christmas and he LOVES them, he says that they are better than any that they have at his gym.  Very durable and only moderately padded, great for the price
Mine is dry sensitive skin and the cream works well. I like the way this cream gives instant glow
It's great to have the option to enjoy Drake's even on Weight Watchers.  Each package is only 4 Weight Watcher points and they still taste like Drake's! ---  --- Yum
It is ironic that you would send this to me.  I can not tell you how excited I was to purchase these slippers.  I had bought everyone in my family UGG slippers for Christmas.  Everyone had cozy slippers but me.....SO instead of paying over $60 I found this pair of Warmbat on amazon.  I researched the brand and thought they may be a good match.  I received the slippers as amazon promised in a timely manner.  The next day the right slipper fell apart the stitching and the bottom of slipper fell off.  I was upset and sewed them, and glued them.  The following week the left slipper fell apart.  I did not want to go thru the process of shipping back the slippers, they were $29.00. SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO disappointed.  Please forward to WARMBAT
If you want a simple to use program to manage personal finances Quicken is for you. I have found it very useful for keeping track of my checking and savings accounts. You can also make automatic posts to your accounts. Which is nice feature if you use automatic online bill pay with your bank. The program makes charts, graphs and reports showing where your money is going and coming from. It also does a nice job showing you if where you are meeting your budget and where you are spending too much money. Quicken makes keeps track of loans easy. It calculates how much money is going to interest and principle. I have been having a hard time and have been unsuccessful at setting up the program to track my 403B account. Overall, I think Quicken is a good program and recommend it to anyone to anyone who does not have a similar product already
Yeah, Johnny must've been drinking heavily during this recording. It's evident in his slurred lyrics...It's Raining is the song where he sounds totally wasted, although you can get the sense that he is infact quite happy and very relaxed. BUT  all this inebriation actually adds to the authenticity of this c.d.---- Johnny Winter really becomes the archetypal BLUESMAN on this c.d.  His guitar work is quite sparse, no long solos on this one but, nevertheless, the feel on this album is wonderful.   I have to say this also..Johnny must've been VERY, VERY brave to release this album back in 1977. That was a very bad year for the blues, appalling infact...disco music was king. Alot of bluesmen, like Johnny Guitar Watson etc were opting for the commercialism of the disco dance floor. Johnny might've thought of releasing a commercial type rock album , like Edgar was doing. Instead he chose to stay faithful to the blues and I have to admire the determination and resolve of Johnny Winter. Very few would've stayed faithful to the blues. ---  The last track with Muddy Waters ..Walking Thru The Park...captures Johnny in his element. He was SO happy back then and it filters over into the song itself. I remember seeing them both do this song live at the Capitol Radio Festival, Alexander Palace, London/England in July 1977. Never again to be repeated, sadly
This appears to be a good piece of equipment. I hav'nt had any major outages as of yet but a minor fluctuation was handled very well.
Everyone in my family (from 3 to 64 years old) loves these organic cookies.  I purchased these cookies at several local stores before I discovered that Amazon had them. I sent a package to my grandson who is in the Army in Iraq and he raved about them.  Newman's has another big winner!
Too loud and the water evaporates way too quickly. I feel like I'm constantly filling the container w/ water. Though my son is a sound sleeper, it is difficult to hear him through the baby monitor b/c of the loudness of the humidificr. I would not buy this item
This high chair is so easy to put together and use.  My grand-daughter loves this chair, the music and toys on top occupy her.  I like how it changes height and reclines.  My grand-daughter was using this chair when she was 3 months.  The recline position came in handy!  I would buy this chair again and highly recommend it to friends and family
This is a great Barney musical songbook, and can also be used as a play piano.  It's great that it has an auto turn off, after non-use.  However, if it is turned off, and something touches it, it automatically turns on by itself.  Many times, after the kids went to bed, and we happen to put something on top of the Barney Sing 'n Play Songbook, it turns on by itself.  Because the Songbook does not have a physical turn off switch, and something touches it, Barney will start talking in the silent room when the kids are asleep.  Just wish it has an on/off switch, so it will not be turned on accidentally.  Otherwise, my 3 year old loves it
Just be sure to read up on this closely... it's not the orchestra you hear in the movie, and you may be especially disappointed when you hear the vocal tracts - gone are great talents Enya and Annie Lennox, replaced by no-name voices.  This is not BAD music, but don't think you're a genius for capturing the music of the movies on one inexpensive 2-CD set
I bought this to transfer LPs to CD. It is simple to connect to the computer, and the software is easy to use. Just be sure when you download  the MP3 encoding program,  to put it in the same directory as the LP ripper. --- The LP recorder works  well and is very easy to use. The LP Ripper, makes it easy to trim the tracks, and then encode them as MP3 files.  --- When saving them as MP3's I can get approximately 20 LP's on one CD. --- I am very satisfied with the product
I got a back of Pico Balla in Germany a couple of years ago and keep coming back to it! Good stuff. Haribo is the gold-standard for gummi candy and this particular type is really good
I had to return this item because the shoes where too big but other than that everything else was ok with the products I received
Downloading objects from fan sites can be hit or miss -- I have had many collections I've downloaded work incorrectly or not work at all in the next expansion pack, and items I really liked were suddenly unavailable.  So, I was looking forward to a "Stuff" pack from Maxis. ---  --- Bah.  Yes, there are several very nice items, but really, this is an underwhelming collection on the whole.  Items are very limited and the collections are small.  The pictures you see on the cover are a good portion of what is contained.  Like so many here remarked, the money spent is not equal to the value received.  Another reviewer pointed out what the title "Glamour Life" implies -- jewelry, house items, luxurious textures for floors and walls, and clothing for all ages, and most of all, excess and abundance.  There's no abundance here.  I've found items I like, but I am not impressed with the collection. ---  --- Maxis knows that its target audience is always hungry for new items, and I think it is taking advantage of the fact, fooling us into thinking we are getting much more than we actually recieve for our money.  I feel a little cheated.  If you must have this, wait until the price drops, or -- better yet -- find a good, reputable fan site  (there are some very good ones out there that have safe downloads) and download for a small fee or for free
Good scent, but it doesn't last more than a week
This sequel to a horror classic started out ok, but by the middle, none of it mattered anymore, I even got a bit tired of the well done gore effects because I had to sit through scenes of a severed [...] and rat duking it out! The original "ReAnimator" is a great flick to see if you want excellent and original gore effects as well as a creepy storyline, but this sequel just stinks
Her favorite toy... she loves the microphone... keys light up to prompt her to press the keys and play a song.... this thing is great
I ordered this for fun and have since decided that it's definitely not for me in any way. It's very drying on my skin, even though it's thick and creamy. The label says it's award-winning, but doesn't state what award it's received (if any!). I fail to see what might warrant it being award-winning. The scent smells like plastic or cheap strawberry candy. Also, it's absurdly priced given the quality. I've tried a few Philosophy items and need to just stop buying them because I'm always disappointed.
I read Bill Bryson's "A Walk in the Woods" and laughed hysterically at many parts of the book, and through the rest was either duly entertained or pleasantly educated (for the "educated" aspect, Bill interlaces the book with fascinating factual tangents). ---  --- I started into "In a Sunburned Country" with similar expectations, and especially since I have always longed and planned to visit Australia.  To state that I was disappointed is a severe understatement.  After reading this book I now have little to no desire to visit the "land down under;" my only hope is that I will completely forget what I read in Bryson's book so that I may one day look forward to and enjoy visiting Australia.  (Senility be merciful and consume me hastily!) ---  --- My best estimate is that Bryson was commissioned to write a ~350 page book about Australia.  During and / or after his trip, his creative sense must have taken a vacation of its own.  I have rarely struggled so much to get through a book as I did with this one.  Bryson even stooped so low as to use an urban legend as a "story" relayed second-hand from one of the Australians he "met."  Such a stunt makes me question if any of his accounts are real in any of his books. ---  --- The only saving grace to this book was the educational tangents.  These, at least, provided for some interesting reading. ---  --- After comparing notes with another person who ventured to read another of Bryson's books ("I'm A Stranger Here Myself") after she read "A Walk in the Woods," it would appear that "In a Sunburned Country" is not the only snore-fest that Bryson has churned out.  Perhaps he isn't a "one hit wonder," but I for one am not going to waste my time or money finding out. ---  --- So, if you are looking for the same caliber of writing that Bryson provided in "A Walk in the Woods," look to another author or prepare to be greatly disappointed. 
This is a gorgeous and "delicate" looking watch. I can read it without my glasses and so far it works. I've had trouble with Timex in the past, so I hope this holds up well. It is very pretty and can go with casual or a nice dress in the evening
I use this for tailgating primarily. It is great because it's cooking size much bigger than it's counterparts. It holds temps well and cooks evenly like all webers do.  ---  --- It's a bit bigger than the smaller smokey joe, but does a nicer job because of it's size.  ---  --- I use it often and will continue to do so. Too bad it is being discontinued.
**1/2 ---  --- When it was released in 1967, "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner" was acclaimed as a "breakthrough" film for its lighthearted, yet serious, depiction of an interracial romance.  In the years since, society has moved so far in the direction of acceptance of so-called "mixed marriages" that any remake is bound to feel, at least to some extent, superfluous and anachronistic.  And that is exactly the case with "Guess Who," a 2005 update whose abbreviated title is only the first of the many changes the filmmakers have rung on the Stanley Kramer original. ---  --- The screenwriters' first alteration involves switching the race roles, so that it is now a black family having to accept a white male as a prospective in-law rather than the other way around.  Bernie Mac assumes the Spencer Tracy role as the father whose world is turned upside down when his beloved daughter brings a Caucasian boyfriend (Ashton Kutcher as a white Sidney Poitier) home to meet the family.  On the distaff side, we have Judith Scott taking over for Katherine Hepburn as the understanding mother and Zoe Saldana replacing Katherine Houghton as the freethinking daughter. ---  --- Since interracial marriage is no longer the hot-button issue it once was, the filmmakers have been forced to inject a number of other non-race-related plot complications into the mix to develop and maintain the conflict and drama.  Thus, we have Kutcher trying to hide the fact from both his fiance and her family that he has recently quit his high-paying job at a prestigious firm and that he may, in fact, be the target of a securities-and-exchange commission probe.  Indeed, with Kutcher spending most of his time trying to win over his critical and overbearing future father-in-law, "Guess Who" feels more like a remake of "Meet the Parents" than of "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner." ---  --- The real problem with "Guess Who" is that it rarely has the courage of its convictions.  Having decided to tackle a relatively dicey topic, the film too often drops the issue in favor of scenes that wouldn't pass muster even on a third-rate sitcom.  For every scene that is incisive and daring - i.e. Kutcher telling a series of black jokes at the family dinner table - there is another that is pure Hollywood hokum (Mac and Kutcher sleeping in the same bed together, Mac and Kutcher having a go-cart race to determine who has the higher testosterone level and the greater machismo, etc.).   ---  --- All of the performers are fine, especially Mac and Kutcher in the lead roles.  However, they just haven`t been given very sophisticated material to work with here.  "Guess Who" might have been a better film had it aimed more for genuine, hard-edged satire and less for lowbrow slapstick and predictable romantic comedy sentimentality.   ---  --- Still, it's been 38 years since "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner" first shocked the nation with its in-your-face defiance of miscegenation laws, and the world has since moved on to other issues of social injustice and marital definition.  Which is why, in the year 2005, "Brokeback Mountain" was a breakthrough film and "Guess Who" was not
This is the stuff that rap dreams are made of!  Just like the movie itself,  this CD is packed with moment after moment of perpetual rollercoaster type thrills that leaves the listener in a sheer state of funk frenzy!  The talent assmbled here is tops and just seems to keep coming at you so,  get in, sit down, buckle up and shut the Fk up because it's about to get rowdy up in here!      
I just got this perfume for Valentine's Day.  I love it!  Yes, it is sweet smelling, as another reviewer mentions, but it's a pleasant sweetness.  Cotton candy does describe it, actually.  But who says grownups don't like smelling yummy??  There's a hint of vanilla as well and overall, I think the combo is fantastic! ---  --- I love Curious, and now I love Fantasy, too!  They are two very different perfumes, so it's easy to understand why a person can like one and not the other.  I will say, though, that Fantasy lasts far longer than Curious.  You can apply it in the morning and still smell it when you go to sleep!  Which, I don't mind at all... ---  --- I recommend this, of course, but I recommend you sample it before you buy.  Just because you liked Curious doesn't mean you will like this one
I bought my Canon A95 in November 2004.  A little after 1 year just after the manufacturer's warranty expired, the infamous E18 error struck.  I called the factory repair center to get a repair estimate, and they quoted $89 plus $8 shipping & handling.  I bought the camera for $300 online, now it's going to cost me roughly 1/3 of its purchase cost to repair it.  For all I know, it might break down again after the repair! The repair comes with 90-Day warranty period, but it COULD break again after 90 days.   ---  --- And then...  --- There is an upgrade option.  Canon offers a program where you can upgrade A95 for A610 for $125 plus $10 shipping and handling.  This comes with only 6-month warranty.  Again, it COULD be flawed with the same e18 error that could struck after warranty expires.   ---  --- I would really do extensive research before buying another CANON.
It only became clear to me how MS undermines Mac by using its software as weapon when I began using MS office for Mac. I have used Window's based Excel everyday at work for the last 20 years and I cannot figure out how to use the Mac version efficiently. It seems like an ersatz version from 15 years ago. If you want to work on PowerPoint docs at home created on your PC at work you will find the effort not worth it...the docs will never transfer formatting properly. I bought this program and almost never use it because it is just so clumsy compared to the PC version. Having said that, there is no alternative to MS office; this is the outcome of MS having monopoly power...no support and an inferior product for Mac user
This game is in such a sorry state that I don't even know where to begin. ---  --- First of all, this is not at all what I expected and what I wanted. Sid is known for very complex simulations and I preordered this game only because I saw his name as the game designer. Alas, the game is the most dumbed down train simulation I had ever seen. Looks like Sid jumped in the "easy, fast and easy" bandwagon. ---  --- Second, the game is, at best, barely out of beta - a little more useful and less destructive than, say, a computer virus. I experience frequent crashes and the AI often builds ridiculous tracks. ---  --- Finally, be aware that the game has one of the worst copy protection systems I had ever seen, which interferes with other applications. For instance, the game won't launch while I run Skype. ---  --- Selling a game in such an unfinished state shows lack of ethics and disrespect for the customer. Shame on you, Firaxis and Sid Meier.
I ordered the loose tea in tins and received 6 boxes of tea bags. The only labeling on the box was a barcode sticker with for tea in tins, which was incorrect. When calling customer service I had only two options -- return the tea bags or keep them and be overcharged. There was no follow up, so there was no way to know if I would receive the correct product if I ordered again. The price had gone up 20% in the mean time. Rather than be without tea (I can't buy that brand where I live), I kept it. You can't get your money back if you are over charged, and you can't complain about it to anyone who cares. I will never use Amazon Grocery again if I can help it, and I suggest you do the same.
Meet Me in St. Louis takes a war-torn America back to a simpler time, a time when telephones were new and everyone was talking about the World's Fair. The Smith family is very close, and although each of them have their problems, they share their lives with each other. Esther (Judy Garland) has a crush on "The Boy Next Door," and sings a beautiful song about him. Rose (Lucille Bremer) hopes to be proposed to, even if it is over the telephone. Tootie (Margaret O'Brien) has a fascination with death and a wants to be included with the older kids. Everyone's lives are changed, however, when they hear that their father is going to move everyone to New York for his job. ---  --- There are plenty of great songs here, and although many of them sound like show-tunes, they enhance the film quite well. Aside from "The Boy Next Door," we have the famous "Trolley Song," as well as the now-classic "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" and a fun number called "Under the Bamboo Tree." Of course, the main title song "Meet Me in St. Louis" is run throughout the film.   ---  --- You might think the story is rather silly and unrealistic, but it is actually based on the memoirs of the woman that Tootie's character is based on. One can learn all about it and other behind the scenes stories like about the romance that developed between Garland and her director Vincente Minelli in the documentary also included on this VHS
Not bad, however, in Version 10, was able to use CNTRL + to zoom in.  Used the + on the number pad -- now this function doesn't work, and the only + that works is that in the top row of the keyboard.  The zoom out "-" in the number pad still works, but not the plus.  I say that's not good. ---  --- Why ruin things with an upgrade
Collateral Damage is the great and partially real action film in which  Arnold Schwarzenger plays a fireman hell bent on getting his hands on the Terrorist who killed his wife and kid and many other citizens near a shopping mall.  ---  --- With the attacks on Sept 11 , movies have tried to cash in but Collateral Damage is different. Arnold even dedicated the movie to firefighters everywhere in an interview  with Byron Allen.  ---  ---  --- The movie is brilliant in showing what only what the motivation behind terrorist attacks , but the depiction of slow agencies like fbi to counter these terrorist attacks.  ---  --- Basically, the FBI and CIA tell Gorden Brewer(Arnold Schwarzennger) that they are working to bring down the terrorist who killed his family, when in fact they  have no good leads on the suspect.  ---  --- Rather, than sitting on his butt, and waiting for the FBI to do something, Gordon takes the law into his own hands and seeks to get justice for his family  by going into Columbia and getting ''The Wolf''(Cliff Curtis) as the terrorist is called.  ---  --- There is a great scene in which Gordon goes crazy and literally beats the hell out of a cold-blooded radio news reporter who says that the victims are pure garbage by saying their ''collateral damage''. The radio reporter explains the reasons behind terrorist attacks but shows no feeling for victims. I loved this scene, because this reporter clearly has no remorse for the dead. He probably has no family of his own, and doesn't know the meaning of life, except to cover his own.  ---  --- Now you might say to yourself what's the difference between Arnold's character (who is going for justice) and the terrorist well here is the big difference from  Arnold himself: ''The difference between me and you is that I am only going to kill you''.  ---  --- Unbelievable action and twists at the end, that you're literally be on the edge of youre seat, and just when you think the movie is over.... it's  not !!!  ---  --- Director Andrew Davis not only gives a fact type based movie based on Columbia, but also a factual based type movie that deals with Terrorism and the lessons that we must learn to see that things like this don't happen again.  --- In fact, most people will remember the horrible case of Wall Street Reporter , Daniel Pearl, who was executed after the U.S. failed to meet the demands of the Middle East terrorist holding.  ---  --- The U.S. should have gone after these terrorists like the way Arnold does in this movie. but then the U.S. does not have a great track record when it comes to nailing terrorist even going back to the 1970's the U.S. supported and backed up --- madmen like General Pinochet in Chile and dictator Samoza in Nicaragua. Both of them killed hundreds of people with U.S. backing and funding. ---  --- Still though ''Collateral Damage'' is a great action film that you must see.
I bought these boots just in time before the crazy weather started.  Let me tell you,these boots are great!!!!!!  I read all the reviews and bought them a half size bigger and now they're a little big, regardless, I love them and another thing, they keep my feet very warm and cozy
This magazine has beautiful pictures, heartwarming stories and as a bonus, a laugh or two.  It covers the countryside of all of the United States and reminds you of a slower, more genteel time.  It makes you want to plan a trip to view the scenery for yourself.  If you long for life outside of the city, you'll enjoy this obvious labor of love
I was a little surprised.  I'm not a huge fan of packaged rice or noodle dishes, but sometimes I need to throw together something quickly.  I was intrigued by the list of ingredients, and decided to give Fox River Rice Creole a try.  I'm glad I did!  This is seriously good stuff -- lots of flavor, easy to prepare, etc.  Best of all, it's not overly salty, one of my pet peeves with packaged food.  It's great as a side dish, but I think it would also be wonderful with a little dded sausage (maybe some andouille).  I'll definitely be purchasing this again
I saw this movie twice, the second time knowing exactly why I wanted to see it again. If you are trying to find out if you love someone or not, make sure that you see this movie. Such a simple but yet such a powerful definition of love it gives. Explains why we are where we are, and makes you part of the harmony. Is love as simple as teaching someone to bike? Think about it.  ---  --- If there are no rules against it, this film should be renominated for Oscar.
When my daughter was born, I didn't know about swaddling, and it would take me HOURS to get her to sleep! I would feed or rock her in my arms until she falls asleep, then put her in her crib... and she'd flail her arms, wake up and cry, and I had to start all over! What a nightmare!  ---  --- Then I figured out that since her arms wake her, it would make sense to wrap her in something so she couldn't move them as much... so I started wrapping her in regular receiving blankets. It worked! It became much easier to get her to sleep. But then she wiggled out of those receiving blankets and wake up again.  ---  --- When she was a little over a month old, somehow I came across SwaddleMe blankets on the Internet and immediately bought it. It worked great! It was so easy to wrap my daughter in it, and it stayed put. My daughter started sleeping so much better!  ---  --- I wish I found those blankets sooner - it would've saved me from so many sleepless nights!  ---  --- 2 years later, my son was born, and thankfully I already knew about those blankets from the start. He goes to sleep great in the SwaddleMe blanket! Out of curiosity, I tried to put him to sleep without this blanket, and his arms wake him right away - exactly the same as my daughter!  ---  --- I consider this blanket one of the most important baby items you could buy. It should be a must for a new mother who wants to get some sleep
I travel a lot, especially to Europe, and hate taking lots of cables with me for the Vonage, router, laptop, cellphone and crackberry. The iJuice unit looked like a good idea. ---  --- HOWEVER, the unit just failed during my trip, leaving me stranded and badly caught out with no back-up.  BAD IDEA ---  --- A friend switched me on to charging everything via USB.  I just bought a cheap $5.00 USB charger for the Nokia, the crackberry charges via USB anyway, so I just needed to buy an ordinary laptop 110/240v adaptor  and I was all set. Laptop and nokia phone all charging away at the same time. ---  --- Single point of failure is the laptop. However, Apple does a great universal adaptor (you can get UK./US etc plugs) with USB for charging Ipods for $20, all in one neat unit. You can just stick the USB for the Nokia in the back.  ---  --- Seriously, don't waste your money, unless you use more than one laptop or really need a particular tip you can't charge via USB. Using USB is far lighter, far more reliable, you don't loose the tips.
The movie starts out with our hero, Izo, being gruesomly crucified. Because of his rage towards the ones who crucified him, he travels through time to present day to wreak his vengence on them. Then a bunch of stuff happens that has no relevance to the plot really, including: having sex with mother nature, a woman pulling a sword out of her vagina then izo throwing a rock at her face, being killed several times, a very trippy scene where he is sucked underwater and comes up on the other side of some wedding where he kills the groom and bride then is sucked back, killing little children, killing a group of mothers in the hallway, vampires, being attacked by a swat team, and a random guy singing while playing an out of tune guitar. While he does all this he turns into a demon then finally kills the ones that were responsible for his crucifixion. ---  --- This movie gets 5 stars because it is so random and has made me mentally insane since watching it and other japanese films like it
My girls love the sandbox!  The only thing my husband and I don't like is that you cannot move it once the sand is in it.  We thought we'd be able to, but the walls are just flimsy enough that you can't.  Otherwise, a great purchase
I recently purchased an HP Laptop that, to my regret, came with a pre-load of Win Vista.  Some of the bad things about this package are: ---  --- 1. The help files are all on line.  If I'm not connected to the internet, I can't access the help files. ---  --- 2. HP does ship it's laptops with the Vista install CD's.  Instead, a CD to purchase an upgrade to the next version of Vista is included. ---  --- 3. For the newer laptops, HP is not producing drivers for any other OS except Vista. ---  --- 4. Vista is less user friendly than XP or even 2000. ---  --- 5. And yes, Vista looks familiarly like OS X, but is harder to work with.  I have owned several Apples and looks are deceiving.  Just because it looks like an Apple doesn't mean it works like one. ---  --- 6. All of my instructional software no longer works.  I use a lot of software to teach Information Security that no longer works on Vista, such as: ---   a. CyberCiege (An information security wargame) ---   b. Boson CCNA Network Simulator ---   c. Visual Studio (Not everything works) ---  --- 7. Also, some of the network management tools will not run or run properly on Vista.  I do a lot of remote management from the workstation versus going to the server.  Many of the vendors that provide tools are way behind the power curve on their Vista support. ---  --- I could go on but what's the point?  I can't even dump Vista to go back to Windows XP or even 2000 if HP won't even make an attempt to produce drivers for the laptop.  Linux is out for the same reason, no drivers.  So I'm basically stuck with an overpriced emailer and word processor. ---  --- If you plan on purchasing a computer, make sure that if you plan on dumping the OS and going back to XP or changing to LINUX, the vendor has all of the drivers to support the change is not on the Microsoft Vista Conspiracy bandwagon
I use this along with the 807 BBQ fork for the BBQ and the Smoker. I use the BBQ Fork for grilling and this for smoking and roasting. The lighted digital dial allows me to see the temperature and settings in dim light.The alarm tells me when the desired temperature is reached.The silicone coated probe is very sturdy and has been problem free
great and fast to deal with will do buisness in the futur
This stuff is great.  A fresh alternative to the regular suspects.  Highly recommended to those who like a bit of a kick in their palate
Tempora mutantur, nos et mutamur in illis - The times change, and we change with them... this is a perfect watch and probably you won't change your time machine for a long time...simple and beautifu
This movie is great if you want to go to sleep and you ran out of boring books. Ethan Hawke leans to heavily on Kris Kristofferson's performances not to mention Jeff Tweedy's music. As a matter of fact the only gleaming light in the movie is the music. It is written interestingly enough, but the visuals look like there wasn't enough money in the budget to clean up the cheap video that it was shot on. The best way to watch this movie is in the background. You don't need the visuals, and if you dare watch them you will get dreary eyed and fade away
The locket on this cable chain is so tiny, you will not be able to put a picture in it.  After opening the box and being completely disappointed, I opened the locket to see how it worked.  It would not close properly after opening.  The quality of this necklace is not good - do not waste your money. 
My baby was playing with the giggle ball when one of the caps fell off and all of the beads spilled on the floor.  Please use caution with this toy!  The toy wasn't being played with roughly and the floor was carpeted.  There was no reason for the toy to fall apart
Although this charger is suggested when purchasing the Verizon Razr, the phone complains that this an "Unauthorized Charger" and it will not charge the phone. Do not waste your time with this
Echoing other reviews, performance is not consistant.  One time we did get excellent coffee, this morning it jammed the Senseo machine with a steam lock and there is not telling when we will be able to re-open it.  Considering the price of these pods, even only one bad pod makes it impossible to recommend the product
The wagon is great, as expected.  5 stars for the wagon, no stars for delivery.   ---  --- It arrived with a dent, though, and when we called they told us a replacement wouldn't be available until mid-February, plus we'd have to figure out how to re-pack the thing, which was halfway assembled before we noticed the dent . . . so we gently banged it out and spray-painted the spot, and the recipients probably won't care, but it was a pain-in-the-butt, and there didn't seem any way to deal with it that wouldn't have been too much trouble.
I bought this camera for my 80 year old mother because I knew that if she was going to try digital photography, it had to be EASY ! The printer dock is simple for her to use to transfer snapshots of her cat to her computer and email them to her friends.   I have used the older CX-7300,( very similar camera) for backpacking for years and it has never failed under harsh conditions. The lack of optical zoom is a plus for me; less to break. The C530 is more compact, has better resolution, and still has the option of using AA batteries when the rechargables die. If you want simple digital snapshots, you will love this little camera
I could never expect to like a lemon scented perfume,but this one is definately different. ---  --- When i first smelt it in the bottle i thought:"Oh,no!Dish soap!",but when i put it on i immediately loved it. ---  --- On me it smells like lemon scented candy.It's so fresh and clean!I couldn't stop smelling my wrist!And everytime i smelt it i felt as if i were in a wet garden and lemon blossoms were falling on my skin! ---  --- It was a nice alternative to all my candy scented perfumes. --- It lasts a long time too and it's affordable,plus it smells like spring! ---  --- The best choise to welcome the hot days of the summer,since it will keep you fresh and cool. ---  --- A must buy!
 This album came out about 8 years before I was born. All the years, I still remember turning on the classic radio stations that would play WBSS or Billie Jean. Now I know all the lyrics and music videos from this album. This is MJ in his prime. Unfortunately, we will never get another epic like this again. Michael is sadly a target in the media, but he is still a great music icon whether you like him or not. Every song off here is a classic. One song I thought was unneccesary was "Baby Be Mine". But otherwise, it's excellent. If you starting an MJ collection, get this album first. Trust me.
I was sceptical about buying this product after reading one of the reveiws about having some trouble with Quicktime. Anyways, I had no problems with this program at all. Guitar is my favorite instrument. I've always wanted to learn how to play guitar. I even bought the cheap $10 dollar videos that basically rush through everything and left me frustrated, and playing the chords all wrong. This video is SO MUCH FUN!!!! I thought I could never play guitar after being so discouraged from learning from other videos. I figured, ok, this is a little more expensive, but at least I will learn how to play over 70 songs!!! I'm so happy that I bought this video. It is worth every penny. I'm currently on the 42nd lesson. Mind you, this video is not one of those "we move along quickly, so if you didn't get it, just rewind" videos. Oh no, this video makes you practice the chords many times so it's in your head. When you're done with this video, you'll feel so confindent. It's like having your own private instructor. Certain things I was doing wrong I no longer do. It has even cleaned up my fingering technique. I have no more words, it's a great video and you can't go wrong with Amazon's price. ---  --- Thank you
The volume control on this is totally lame.  I can't get it quite enough to put on the crib for bedtime.  Also, the sound quality is poor in general.  I suppose it's OK for just playing in the room, but definitely not for bed.  You can probably get something with better sound quality for a comprable price
I have this lip gloss in Sweetie and will be trying other shades.  I am very pleased with it!  I wear it over stay-on type lip colors in other brands, and it keeps my color on all day (even after eating)!  It doesn't really feel too sticky if you blot after application.  I only wish it tasted as good as it smells (not that it tastes bad, it's just blah)!     
I have never ordered anything such as this online. I was surprised that the nuts arrived in about half as much time as the site said it would take. I will consider ordering again once I have used these up. The walnuts were so fresh and nice, not all broken up, as some have been when I have purchased them at the grocery store.  
I was browsing through Amazon when I came upon Nvie jewelry and I absolutely love it! I bought this necklace for my mom for her birthday, but had a hard time not keeping it for myself. The necklace was really nice, well constructed, and it was shipped quickly. It looked just like the picture, but I have a feeling that each piece of jewelry is truly one-of-a-kind.I would recommend Nvie Designs to anyone for buying really lovely, affordably priced jewelry. --- 
I in 1996 I bought and read All the Pretty Horses first. Laughed myself off the train seat in to town.  Bought the whole lot and read them in chronological order - re-reading Pretty Horses on the way.  Along with scenes from the Orchard Keeper, Sutree sticks in my mind - images ideas, flavours, jokes, and a personality that I'd rather see more of.  Sutree made me feel that I know this man, and could even like him.  Great fun, and deserves selfish time to read and unwind after reading.
I was so dissapointed with this camera! I purchased a Sony Cybershot 3 years ago and, it had been such a great camera, I automatically thought this newer model would be great. Almost every picture I took was either blurry or the light areas of the picture were blown out! As an experienced Cybershot user, I tried all settings to fix the problem, but no luck. Terrible for capturing a child's first steps, as the description says. Would not recommend
Good, but it simply wasn't actionous enough. I don't mind having no action in a book (otherwise how else could I love Foundation so much?), but Children was a book that NEEDED to have action in it. Unfortunately it didn't really. Too much philosophical babble that I had to re-read to get it. Slightly reminiscent of Card's later Shadow series with the sheer amount of internal monologue. Too much about Jane, not enough about the pequeninos and barely anything about Ender, which annoyed me. To my shock Ender's death did not really impact me in any way, beyond--"Huh? Wait...Ender is dead?", so little was his role in the book. He probably talked for only about twelve pages altogether. ---  --- EDIT: From now on I am never giving a book that I halfway like two stars again because each time, I receive the urge to change my rating to three stars.  Just keep in mind that while it says two, it means three
I purchased this towel warmer for my wife.  She has been very disappointed.  It simply does not get hot enough to heat towels so she has stopped using it.   I would not recommend it to anyone.
I've only just started.  But so far, I am very pleased with this language program.  My only regret is that I don't have enough time to keep at it.  The various learning modalities are quite useful-this is the only program (aside from taking a class) that i've used which does this.  I recommend it
We bought our Floppy Seat when our baby boy was about 6 months old.  Even though he was still a little "floppy" himself when it came to sitting up, the Floppy Seat supported him. He's now 18 months old, and it's still going strong!  Although, now he wears "real" shoes, and the leg openings tend to get caught on then. It took a little practice to get the hang of the threading the belt through the cart, but now it's SO fast!   ---  --- We also use it EVERY time we go out to eat.  As a matter of fact, the one (and ONLY) time we forgot to bring it along, our son started to choke while sitting in a restaurant highchair.  The belt buckle on the old restaurant chair became stuck, and would NOT open, after multiple attempts!  We were forced to turn the whole chair sideways in order to proceed to clear his airway. He was fine, but we were all shaken up! If we'd had our (familiar) floppy Seat cover, we would have been able to help our son a few moments faster. Every second counts!
Camenson definitely has experience in this career with many "career books" to her credit.  However, there are better books out there on writing with more information. This book follows the same old tired format that VGM books are 'not so' famous for.  The internet has more info for a lot less money
This is the worst version of Adobe Illustrator to be released since version 9. Opens files that I've been using for years and then writes scribbled, unopenable 'saved' versions. Crashes. Can't save for mysterious reasons. Writes "version 10" files with text split into pieces. ---  --- Such a fine product! Really glad I paid money for it!! ---  --- I downgraded back to Irritator 10
In this movie we once again see Mad Max (sans hot car) wandering around in a Post Apocalyptic world until he discovers Bartertown in the Wasteland.Mel Gibson tries valiantly  to channel  such on screen loners as Clint Eastwood  and John Wayne but only succeeds in making his character look inarticulate with poor social  skills. However he becomes a threat to the Matriarch of the town by the name of Aunty EmTeeVee (or something like that). Then Mel kicks a lot of butt in the process. This is a dismal tedious movie which is only redeemed by the fact that it was filmed in the Outback Opal Mining Town of Coober Pedy which I visited a few years ago
I recently purchased the anime studio 5 but not the --- pro version, which costs 150 more and gives more functionality. ---  --- This is a fully functioning animation software, with lots of  --- interesting features. I can see no reason that a novice --- animator such as I am would not be happy with this software. ---  --- I would like to see more energy put into a manual, but you  --- can scavenge the anime blog/chat site to find answers, or --- google other places.  With a more robust manual, this would --- be 5 stars, not 4.  It is really the reason I am reluctant --- to upgrade to Pro, because I would want more lessons and --- tutorials to go along with the upgrade.  ---  --- If you have an interest in animating, this is the software  --- for you.  --- 
You've read a lot of reviews to get to this one, most likely, and they've gone on about how great it looks (it does look tremendous), how fantastic the gameplay is (it is awe-inspiring), and how just absolutely great of a gaming experience it is. There are a few things that I would like to add. First off, there is one slight problem with the game. Personally, with action games of the 3rd-person variety, I like to be able to control the camera. This game does not have that. Instead, you are taken where the gamemakers want you to go and only what they want you to see. This is a very slight complaint, and one I'm hoping will be improved with GOD OF WAR II. The second thing that I would like to add is that the Mythological aspect of this game is GREAT! It really gives the game a very epic scale that is not found in a great many games. It's the thing that drives this game farther than it usually would. It's a tremendously entertaining, and oft-times thought-provoking, game that has a sense of gravitas that most action slice'em-dice'em games of this type get to. Get it
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS TOY, THE BATTERY IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR THIS TOY. LEARN FROM MY MISTAKE. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!! no where in the product discription does it tell you that the 9.6 volt battery is NOT INCLUDED, all it says, is that you will have to purchase a 9 volt battery for the remote. Don't look for the Tyco 9.6 volt battery in a store or on line, because it will be "out of stock". I have been trying to purchase one for  4 months
I can't wait to see the original film again. I remember seeing the lemmings plunging into the sea. Thus was born the inspiration for the great PC game, Lemmings. Yes, I know that the lemmings were 'manipulated' into suicide. Nevertheless I love this movie. I hope that they don't cut the lemming sequence. Disney has promised a full restoration. Other animals that left a strong impression on me were the musk oxen in a circle being blasted with an Arctic blizzard. The hardships of an Arctic existence were beautifully photographed
This is an emotionally charged, witty, and brilliantly told drama of four friends struggling to understand marriage, divorce, intamacy, and each other.  One of the best plays I've seen/read
the shoes were in great shape, the shipping speed was fast, really satisfie
This grinder was recommended to me, but I have to say I find it frustrating to use.  Juice leaks out the bottom when grinding steamed vegetables or juicy fruit, and grinding some things (e.g., green beans) takes a lot of force.  While the price is fine, the high cost of "shipping and handling" to purchase one unit made me angry; had I noticed before I bought it, I wouldn't have!  Since then I've noticed that this is sold at most local grocery stores
The product is flimsy, the step is too close to the toilet to be practical for a child to step up on, the deflector is not tall enough to deflect any urine, and the seat is too large for a toddler.  My child does not feel comfortable using this potty
My best friend got this movie at her birthday and i watch it at her house it WAS SO FUNNY!!!!!! Anybody who love SPONGEBOB will LOVE this MOVIE!!!!!!
THIS 1948 15-CHAPTER SERIAL FEATURES SUPERMAN [PLAYED HERE BY THE LATE KIRK ALYN] GOING UP AGAINST A GANG OF CROOKS. THIS IS A HELL OF A LOT BETTER THAN THE 1950S TV SHOW THAT FEATURED GEORGE REEVES! AT LEAST THIS SERIAL WAS FUN TO WATCH AND AT LEAST YOU CAN GET INTO WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS MOVIE. YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO FIND THIS SERIAL IN STORES TODAY, BUT, IF, BY SOME CHANCE, YOU COME ACROSS THIS VIDEO, GET IT!!!!
First off, Robert DeNiro as the monster. I saw him and immediately thought of Jake LaMotta or Vito Corleone. They didn't even try to disguise his accent and no-one ever explains why the monster sounds like he just got off the plane from New York. Second, Kenneth Brannagh was so in love with  the set that he forgot about story. Finally the scene where Elizabeth was ressurected was ridiculous. Frankenstien's shock that she's not happy to be back--burnt up, cut of and her heart pulled out of her chest-- was supposed to be touching but I laughed. We all know how great Kenneth Brannagh is but he got completely carried away here and the result was really, really, really bad.  ---  --- I give it two stars for the pretty costumes and utter magnificence of Aidan Quinn's face.
Great sound. love the volume control on the wire. great fit to almost any head size or shape. Overall a great purchase and I love their product
I'm very pleased with this small unit that has a great deal of power. It's compact, not heavy, has an adjustable power output by simply spinning the wheel on the camera to the left or right. In addition to the light output, the head can be tilted so the light can be direct or bounced, an excellent feature. Getting up and running with this unit was a breeze because I am totally "brochure reading averse."  ---  --- Twenty years ago I was a photographer with big equipment, but had given up both.  I was surprised by the control one has with such a small and relatively inexpensive unit
My son loves this game.  When moving around the tracks, in the one game it can be difficult, the key is if you moving up or down, depending on which direction you need to go, push the joystick the direction once and let go, after that push the joystick the direction the train needs to go. I hope this helps.  My son will be 3 in less then a month and it took him a week to figure out how to move around the tracks.  Mom, dad and sis had to play before that.  The other games are a little easier, but I found the games educational and my son loves it
A friend shared her MarketSpice tea with me years ago, and I was so pleased to run across an old brochure she had given me.  I ordered some, and that wonderful taste was still the same.  The teabags are so fresh and full of flavor that the oils in the tea cling to the clear bag they come in. It's a flavor you won't find anywhere else.  You can taste the orange and the cinnamon, and they're just a little sweet - you may not need to even sweeten yours!
Brush applicator puts it exactly where I want. Gives my lips a great "wet look", without being messy. Never bleeds & lasts for hours without touch-ups. This is the only gloss I'll use
I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PAPER FOR YEARS WITH WONDERFUL RESULTS. MY PRINTED PAGES COME OUT CRISP AND CLEAR.  I HAVE NEVER MADE A HOLE IN THE PAPER USING A PEN OR PENCIL.  I FOLD THIS PAPER ALL THE TIME AND HAVE NEVER HAD IT RIP ON THE FOLD OR ANYWHERE ELSE.  I AM CONFUSED BY THE REVIEWER'S COMMENTS. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT
This battery was no better then the old battery it replaced.  When phone was new, battery life was good. Not sure what is the problem.  Maybe the newly purchased battery is old with no use. Vendor service was good. Or maybe just a bad battery.
Rock Star soap appeals to my playful side and the scent in this soap leaves one a little giddy. The sweet vanilla fragrance is blended with perfumes and the result is something like a spicy vanilla and strawberry milkshake. Can I say yum?  ---  --- This is absolutely delish and I think they may have added a little cinnamon to the mix. I love keeping lush soaps by the sink because they don't seem to dry out my hands as much as gel soaps. This one is perfect in combination with the Smitten hand cream.  ---  --- Rock Star soap left me dreaming about buying other "vanilla" themed items like Think Pink (which I tried), Creamy Candy (a bubble bar), Sympathy for the Skin (which I'm dying to try) and Honey Trap (which I just tossed recklessly into my shopping cart). Candy Fluff sounds like it would go well with this experience. If you love this soaps creamy consistency, Gratuitous Violets, Sultana of Soap and Alkmaar will impress.  ---  --- Any chance the vanilla toothpaste will be listed here soon? Wish, wish... ---  --- ~The Rebecca Review 
The CD came without a CD case and the CD did not play.  I am very disappointed
If you're looking to create the next Doom 3 or Half-Life 2, then I can't really recommend this program. If you want to make an advanced FPS game, or a simple pong game, then I can recommend Dark Basic. In fact, Dark Basic Professional is probably capable of creating any kind of game that you can come up with. The catch? You have to program it yourself, all from scratch. Dark Basic makes manipulating 3D data extremely easy, but it's not a game creation package which lets you click and create. If you are determined enough, it's easy to learn all of Dark Basic's commands, as half of programming a game is in the logic. Dark Basic will hardly limit you, and will give you capabilities that were probably impossibly hard for you to use in C++. The end result of creating a game from scratch results in a tremendous sense of satisfaction, especially when you share it with friends and family. Although previous versions of Dark Basic Professional had some hardly crippling bugs, most of them have been eliminated, and with the release of upgrade 6.0, DBPro is a very stable development engine. Overall, I totally recommend this to anyone who wants to create a game, but is determined enough to learn how
In my opionion, Act! is clearly still the best contact manager on the market. I am not talking about a complex CRM solution, but it is a fine contact manager. I am not using the Outlook and Palm interfaces and I don't have any complains other than it is slow if you are running many programs at the same time. ---  --- The built in email features are okay, seach features are excellent. Just give it a 30 day trial and compare to Goldmine, Maximizer and others
I was very excited that one of My "boys" had bought Me this chair, but when it finally arrived, I was very disppointed. the motors are semi weak, it does NOT feel like 10 motors more like 6 if that. the chair's pic is also very unrealistic in My opinion, the seating it not attached, its a pad, very cheaply made not worth the price at all... I wouldnt pay more then 80.00 for this chair!
I was eager to read this book only to find it a terrible dissapointment.  One would think that a 'scholar' such as he would have at least a basic understanding of the Hebraic roots of Judeo-Christianity.   --- It was obvious that he clearly was clueless to the known Messianic signs spoken of in the Gospels.  He is also clueless to the Pharisidical Judaism of the time..not comprehending that all of Christ's teachings were completely in keeping with true Judaism. All of which can be found in contemporary Rabbinical teachings of His time. This book, which some unfortunate readers will swallow as truth will only continue to propagate a backward understanding of the gospels.   --- Like it or not..the New Testament writings are Hebraic and explain what fulfilled Judaism is.  Those who need to divorce Judaism from Christianity are offering a church which is already confused, just more confusion. It is through studying the Hebraic roots that we even begin to understand the 'difficult' sayings of our Lord; 'fullfillment of the Law', binding and loosing (the Law)..etc as well as the parables.  The delivering of the deaf mute..was a Messianic sign, because the Rabbi's knew that 'they' had to ask the said demon its name but He did not.  Lazerus's resurrection was a Messianic sign because the Rabbi's believed that anyone could come back to life during the first 'three' days after death.  Cleansing of a leper was  Messainic sign because the Rabbi's understood that it was a 'divine' punishment, that only God could lift. How else can we link Isa 53 with the 'stripes' He was to received as part of fulfilling the punishment the Law required for transgression, and yet 'minus one'. Had our Lord transgressed the Law, then the Jews themselves could have legally killed Him.  Remember Paul (Saul)?  He also does not understand John and his huge part in the whole picture, in that the Kingdom 'began' with John.  He was the 'breachmaker' as fortold in prophecy.  This is Hebraic roots 101.   --- People, please study the Hebraic roots of Christianity and do not waste your time with this book. The fact that he keeps defending his position as 'not' anti-semetic, should give you a clue
very cheap, you can tell it's an fake camera miles away. sure it has these features of motion detector which makes it move and has led lights; but not worth 6 dollars at all. stay awa
I was very displeased when I received the Feuilles de Brick. I had to cater for an important client. All the ingredients ready to be  assembled in the Feuilles and due to their dryness (the Feuilles de Brick) I could not bake my desserts
A very enjoyable documentary from the personal perspective of an ex Christian.We need many such documentaries out there to help inform people about the dangers of religion in general. I wish some brave person would do a film about how Christianity came into being from an objective historical perspective. This film touched on the subject, but it was not really the focus of the documentary.Perhaps we will be "blessed" by a further exploration of the subject in the future
I'm sorry...I really, really tried to get into this movie and just couldn't.  It was just plain boring.  Normally I love these types of movies but not this one.  I just kept waiting and waiting for the 'point' or for something to make the last hour and a half of watching it worthwhile.  Never happened.  I would recommend renting this one first just to make sure
This product helps you copy anything on your computer to your nokia phone.I love it to death and use it almost everyday.Eforcity really did a good job shipping it to me and I completely want more bussiness with them
I love this stuff having grown up in Hong Kong, then a British colony, we ate this stuff like water.  It's an acquired taste though if you were not brought up on it. Spread it thin over bread and butter.  Delicious
Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for
I used to have a Graco Metrolite stroller, and I really liked it. However, I gave it to a relative because it went with an infant travel system. I bought a used Jeep Liberty Stroller, thinking it would be an upgrade, and boy was I wrong.  ---  --- I will simply list the things I do not like: --- 1) It is quite bulky when folded, especially compared to other strollers I've had. --- 2) It is heavy, awkward to carry, and there's nowhere apparent to grab it. Handles? I don't see any. --- 3) All 3 tires went flat. My local bike shop charged about $30 to replace them all (your mileage may vary). --- 4) My daughter was not interested in the steering wheel and since the battery that the previous owner left in it had corroded, the sounds didn't work so I can't comment on those. --- 5) It CREAKS when you push it. I'm not sure where the sound is coming from but we oiled the wheels and it still creaks. --- 6) The MP3 player, which is the "cool factor" and the only reason my husband has prevented me from getting rid of the stroller, has these small speakers near the baby's head, so in order to really hear the music if you're playing music YOU like, you have to turn it up. And the volume doesn't go very high. For the same money, you could probably buy some portable powered speakers and clip them to the stroller.
I measured 7 batteries out of the pack of 20 with La Crosse charger, which I also bought from Amazon.  The capacity ranged from 547 mAh to 2002 mAh, with the average being 886 mAh.  That's about a third of the stated capacity.  Before I took the measurements, I made sure the charger works properly by testing it with two different brands of AA NiMH batteries: La Crosse and Energizer.  Both scored very close to their stated capacity.  Therefore, the test is valid and SUNPAK's claim of 2650 mAh is grossly overstated.  ---  --- My advice: avoid SUNPAK like the Plague! ---  --- 
Although this product is very nice, I feel as though the wording that they use to describe it is incorrect. To me the words "charge all at once" means that I can charge all the devices with only one cord that plugs into the wall. However, this is not the case. This item is simply a method for organizing you devices. Although it is a nice idea, it is certainly not worth the $34.99 I paid, and if it wasn't a gift, and Christmas wasn't 3.5 days away, I WOULD return it. I feel that by using the words, "charge all at once" they are purposely misleading the customer.
For someone like myself that is new to selling and licensing art,this book is so informative. I am so glad that I bought it. It is also a good reference book to keep on hand. I recommend it.
Fun idea.. really, really fun idea.   ---  --- However, I gave each of my teenagers (11 & 14),  a Reindeer Jelly Bean Candy Pooper.  It was some task for the kids (and the rest of the family) to get the dam things out of the packaging w/o breaking them.    The first one lost it's rear legs before getting all the way out of the package.  woof!  The second one stay together long enough to see the new year.  TIP use a razor blade and be careful of the legs
Came quickly and was exactly as offered. I am completly satisfie
I did get a nice little buzz the first two days I took this product, and it does give you a boost when you take it right before you work out.  You can push yourself a bit further at the gym.  The gassiness and stomach discomfort are what cause me to not recommend this product.  It wasn't so good or effective that the side effects were worth it.  I had no lasting weight loss when taking it, just lost 3 lbs the first 2 days taking it which climbed back on a day later.  I'd skip it
A great portable shelter for sun and rain. We bought it for a backyard event to give some shelter if it had rained. The weather turned out to be great and sunny, so the shelter was used to give our guest some shades from the bright sun. It was easy to set up and bring down. And the roller bag is also a good accessory to have to store and tranport the shelter easily
Bridget Jones, modern day woman, brillant and doesn't know it, prone to accidents and mess ups but manages to come out of them.   ---  --- This is the book that started it all with the chick lit fever.  Bridget Jones is my hero! 
I originally wanted the Orange colored Tsubos, but they were out of stock, so I decided to go with the pickle color. I absolutely love em! The comfort and style are unique and satisfying. It is because of shoes like this I have become a shoe expert of sorts
My little cousin sarah loves this toy. i bought it at wal-mart in springfield. it works with or without water and features realistic sounds. i am now on my way to purchase another for my 6 year old cousin sean
The roll of paper that I recieved had what appeares to be 3 roller marks down the paper.  I am trying to get it replaced but Adorama is not willing to help out because the order is more then 14 days old.  I was not informed to inspect the product on arrival to insure a 14 day turn aroundf on issues. --- 
Half of the product came with mold growing on it.  The other half tasted so artifical that we just threw it out
I've had this for a week, it may not function as well in a year, and that is something you might want to keep in mind reading this. ---  --- So far, however, it's been a great replacement for a wallet. Don't get me wrong, I still have my wallet and will likely use it when travelling. But for everyday use this is far more practical and comfortable to carry. It's also as easy on the eyes as it is in the pocket - equally pleasant to carry and look at. ---  --- Feels sturdy and durable; light but not flimsy. This can hold upto 5 cards and maybe 20 bill notes. ---  --- Be warned, however, although the clip does hold 5 credit card-sized cards (ID's, and whatever else you may have) it is only really easy to remove the topmost and bottom most cards. That is, if you have 5 cards you use quite often you may want to look else where. ---  --- Personally, I have an ID on the top and my credit card on the bottom. The other three cards are ones I almost never use, or use very rarely. ---  --- One of the concerns I had purchasing this is whether or not it will securly hold less than 5 cards. It does (there are pressure clips on the sides of where the card goes in), but I wouldn't recommend it. Just didn't feel safe enough, even with 4 cards. ---  --- Something I did not foresee purchasing this is that the clip secures the money very tightly. Consequently: 1) When you press down the clip, it drags the money back a few millimeters. If you put the money in too far back it'll crumple it up. 2) When secured, you can't just pull out a bill, you will have to lift the clip up. The first point I've found a little more bothersome than the second, but after playing around with it for half an hour or so I've got the hang of clamping it without crumpling the money. ---  --- That being said, it really is a very nice item and would be an awesome gift to give to a friend, husband, father, or for your own personal use - if it suites their or your dress style. ---  --- (If you are wondering why it is a 4 star and not a 5... well, for no real good reason. It does deserve 5 stars, but the little issues with the clip tugging on the money as you clamp it down - although it means money is held more securely - that holding less than 5 cards didn't feel too secure, and pulling out any card other than the top and bottom most cards is difficult, dropped it down to a 4. It may just be that these are issues that were neccessary to keep the product as fanatastic as it is. 4.5 stars might have been a welcome option, this is as close to perfect as it gets.
It never ceases to amaze me that you Brits eat this horrific dog food-paste.  ---  --- No wonder you lost the revolutionary war.   ---  --- It's clear from you eating Marmite and Vegamite that you never deserved those colonies anyway
I bought this camera for myself during Christmas 2004. ---  --- It was suppose to be a utility camera, ebay items and class projects for the kids only--I don't trust digital cameras for family photos. ---  --- The Kodak CX7300 seemed to fit the bill; inexpensive, easy to use and with more than enough resolution at 3.2mp. ---  --- The flaw in this camera didn't appear until I pulled it out of the drawer some months later. The camera wouldn't turn on. I checked the batteries and they were in excellent shape. I eventually tried replacing the batteries and, sure enough, that worked. ---  --- The next time I took out the camera, the exact same thing happened. And the time after that. ---  --- At first, I thought the CX7300 was eating the batteries. But eventually I came to the conclusion that the camera doesn't eat batteries, it nibbles at them. It won't run on anything but brand-spanking-new batteries. ---  --- The Kodak batteries that came with the CX7300 are still in my mini-mag flashlight, going strong. ---  --- I contacted Kodak about this flaw. They wanted to talk about what kind of batteries I'm using--Kodak--or the option of my purchasing a Camera Dock and some rechargeable batteries. A solution that would increase my investment by about seventy-five percent. ---  --- I thought that buying an optional AC Adapter would be the simple, and cheap, solution. Surprise, surprise, the CX7300 is one of the few digital cameras Kodak makes that doesn't take one. ---  --- So, now that I'm way past warranty, what do I do with it? ---  --- I'm shopping for another camera
We started playing this for our one year old when we were driving on a short trip out of town. As babies sometimes do, she began screaming and was unconsolable... UNTIL we turned on Rocket Ship Beach. Polly wolly doodle calmed her right down and continues to do so. We played that song at least 6 times in a row that day! now that she's a little older, she points to the cd player in the car if something else is playing, requesting her cd be played.  ---  --- I've always enjoyed a wide range of music, and was afraid that after having a child, we'd be reduced to listening to watered down "kid music" like that purple dinosaur and those australian guys. There is a mixture of classics reimagined and new songs that i find myself humming all of the time. There is a good variety of instrumentation and styles. Our daughter claps at the end of her favorites and often waves her arms about.  ---  --- Got kids? Buy this cd!
Bakel's "Pettinice" rolled fondant, imported from New Zealand, is one of the favorite choices for pastry chefs (both amateur & professional) worldwide. It's available in white, ivory, or chocolate, and can be purchased in resealable 15 lb tubs or 5 lb packages. ---  --- Fondant can be flavored with small amounts of various flavoring compounds e.g. chocolate & pure extracts. Concentrated food coloring provides you with nearly a limitless spectrum of coloring options.  ---  --- The 15 lb. tub should retail around $44.99 (plus shipping), and the 5 lb. package should retail around $16.99 (plus shipping).
I followed the advice of the reviewers before me and ordered them a half size bigger than I normally would and they fit great!  Super cute with jeans or a sexy dress!  Great job Jessica
I currently have version 1.0 on my pc. It does everything it claims to and does it flawlessly. It cleans internet cache, history, cookies and more! I've tried another internet privacy program, but it failed to clean up the tracks that this program successfully cleaned. I especially like the fact that it cleans the autocomplete entries in my internet search and internet browser. Others can use my pc, and won't be able to see what documents I've recently opened, which programs I've recently run, or what I've searched for and what sites I've visited online. And that's the way it should be! This program can be set to clean up this information securely (can be set to wipe not just delete the info). Another plus, it can clean usage tracks for all users on a pc. The program I tried on my other pc only worked with administrator accounts (and not very well may I ad)
Maybe I just got a bad one....but this darn thing broke with the FIRST piece of paper I put in it.  I hope you get a better one than I did.  
This is a great PDA Bible for many reasons, several of which are already mentioned in other reviews.  It is easy to use, has most of the NIV Study Bible notes and crossreferences, comes with a multi color highlighter (great for using different colors for different purposes...red for commands, blue for promises, etc.), you can change the font for easier reading, and it has a great search engine in case you want all of the references to, say "peace" that occured in the New Testament.  The programs that come with it are nice as well, including one that tells you what to read if you want to read the Bible in one year, the OT in one year, the NT in one year, and many more options. ---  --- I was somewhat disappointed by a few features that would have made it a hands-down 5 star program, though.  The original NIV Study Bible has elaborate introductions for each book, including author, purpose, structure, and much more.  The Palm version is lacking all of this, and has no introduction at all.   ---  --- The original also has many cultural information boxes all throughout the Bible, like a description of the differences between Pharasees and Sauducees; the palm version does not.   ---  --- The cross references are wonderful - click on a small circle after a verse, and all of the cross references pop up.  Simply click on a cross reference, and the program takes you right there.  Unfortunately, however, the Palm program has no feature like a "back" button that gets you back to the original text.  Finding your original spot is not difficult - it only takes 5 seconds and a little concentration - but would have been much nicer to go instantly back the same way you can instantly get to a cross refernce by clicking on it.   ---  --- Finally, I would be actively marketing this product and the Palm platform to all of my friends if it included all of the wonderful maps that the original has - maps of the Holyland, Jerusalem, the Middle East, the Temple, and others that are in my paper NIV Study Bible.   ---  --- Despite these flaws, however, the program is a joy to use and I highly recommend it to all.  I am using a Tungsten T3 - the larger screen size make reading easier
The emotionally healing benefits of orange oil and lavender become immediately apparent when you apply this to your scalp. If you can find someone to give you a head massage with this product, then you can truly relax. If applying this yourself, it works well as an at home hair treatment to nourish the hair follicles and promote healthy hair growth. You will also notice your hair becoming stronger and retaining a much deeper shine. The essential oils in this product help to activate micro-circulation which may cause a slight tingling and warming of the scalp. Leave this in for about 5-10 minutes and then wash your hair as normal. You may find you need less conditioner when using this product. Many hairdressers will use this product when giving a conditioning head massage and that is where I first found out about this product. I bought my first bottle the day I had the massage. I was that impressed and I keep buying this product.  ---  --- ~The Rebecca Review 
This Linksys stuff simply doesn't work. And don't try getting technical support - it's a complete waste of time. If you can't Google the solution, just take the stuff back. ---  --- The adapter install took out my TCPIP stack, even for my WIRED connection. It took me 3 full days to figure out that I needed to remove any sign of Linksys, Odyssey, and Funk Software from the registry, then remove and reinstall the TCPIP stack. Linksys support couldn't even get me a promised registry cleaner after 28 days, a dozen emails, and 5 separate phone calls. --- Linksys support is just embarrassing. Don't be caught having to depend on it
Sword looks awesome! very heavy and cool. Blade is strong but not sharp..for collector purposes. handle and point where blade connects to hilt is very shaky  but can be fixed quickly. Overall sword and scabbard are very realistic and cool looking
The Drishti Yoga Strap is just great!  I've tried a lot of straps in my time practicing yoga.  (Several different studios, borrowed friends', etc.)  This one is excellent.  It's 2 feet longer than standards straps, but it's offered at the same price as standard straps - what a deal!  It's also thick and sturdy.  I would certainly recommend this product
Valerian and Chamomile are blended with spearmint leaves, lemon grass, hawthorn berries and orange blossoms to create a delicious tea to savor late at night before you drift off into dreams. This tea is much more effective than regular Sleepytime and I can say this because my sleep cycle has been fairly regular with much fewer nights of tossing and turning. You may also find that your mood the next day is rather mild and you feel more relaxed in general. This could be due to getting a good night's sleep for a change or it could be that the valerian has a lasting effect. Valerian is a very effective herb if you can't get to sleep and this tea is highly recommended for insomnia. Unlike sleeping pills, you won't feel groggy the next morning. Blend in a little lavender or orange blossom honey to enhance this deliciously mild minty tea.  ---  --- ~The Rebecca Review  ---  --- 
Great magazine. They got good tips on everything. Eating/Building Muscle/Sheddin excess fat/ All that. Recommend this mag to body builders. I get it every month. Good stuff
very excellent flavor.  I gave my son a few packets, and he said that his 9-month-old grabbed some off his plate.  A lttle spicy, but excellent over Jasmine rice
I can't say enough good about this lipstick.  I am a Black woman with a light-skinned golden brown complexion, like Halle Berry.  When I received the Malibu Peach my first impression was that it was too light and that my lips were going to look ashy.  However, when applied it is the perfect smooth sheer soft peach color.  It's a very rich product and the case is elegant. It doesn't have that funky smell or taste that a lot of lip products do and it's not sticky!!  I love MAC but if my hair blows into my face it sticks to my lips (eww).  Big ups to Mally! (thumbs that is..lol) I will definitely be trying some other Mally products.  I also ordered the brow kit in Sable which is first rate
I am a fan of Ralph Lauren and check new products from this brand. I liked this scent, although I am probably more used to Polo Blue, which is also great. It is better to get an idea in a store because it is not quite possible to decide from reviews. Anyway, it is worth checking especially if you are looking for a new cologne for St. Valentine's day
I received these earrings as a gift, and I don't know what they are made of, but I get an awful lot of compliments on them.  They seem to change color in response to what I am wearing.  I would definitely order other Silver Insanity items
This is the best diet product ever!  I tried them all and "SKINNY WATER?" is the easiest and cheapest diet idea ever.  The product taste great and it really removes any desire to eat too much.  I drink just 3 bottles a day and so far the pounds just melt away.  I lost 15 lbs. in 20 days.  Great taste, it works great, and it's so inexpensive.  Great job to who ever came up with the idea of drinking water and losing weight.  The owners should hire me to do commercials for them
This is a really nice remake of a great classic (FFIV).  They improved the dialogue, and added in a lot of great items.  The challenge level, however, was bumped up significantly.  The game was originally paced so you didn't have to spend nearly as much time leveling up.  A few of the bosses surprised me this time through (I've played the SNES version multiple times in my day).  The story is unchanged, however.  A must have for any FF/Classic RPG fan!  As a bonus, I finally got to play Chrono Trigger
This CD is absolutely wonderful. I am in Australia so Strawberry Shortcake merchandise is not as readily available down here as it is in the USA, so you can imagine my daughters delight when this CD is being played. --- The songs are just gorgeous - I just wish they were a little longer. --- I thoroughly recommend this item to any little SS Fans. --- 
I have been using this cord for about a year, and I had problems with its durability.  It actually worked fine for a for the first 5 months, but then it started to fall apart.  When mounted on the hotshoe of my flash bracket, the thin plastic shoe (where the flash is attached to) developed a crack and eventually broke off, making it useless to mount the flash.  I had to buy a replacement part from Canon (who charged me $16 for this small plastic piece).  I flipped the flash carefully from then on, but then it still cracked!!  I wrote to Canon and asked them to reinforce the bottom maybe made of metal instead of thin plastic. So far, there is no response.  A few months later, the cord, for some unknown reason, makes my 550ex flash switch from the ETTL to TTL mode, and making the flash fire at full power, overexposing  the entire image.  I checked the flash by putting it directly on the camera's hotshoe, and the flash worked fine, switching back to the ETTL mode.  For a piece of equipment from Canon, it's hard to imagine it giving so many problems. It's like they only paid tons more attention to their cameras than their accessories.  As there are no other OEM manufacturers of this cord, I am forced to get another one and hope for the best.
As a field engineer I have to work with tools inside machinery.  More often than not I keep my watch and I have had several scratched watches in the past. So I was somewhat skeptical to wear a nice watch like this but the price seemed right to give it a try. After 9 months of using it daily, this watch has still not a single scratch. The quality is very good and it really looks better than on the picture
After been loaned this issue of June 2004, by a committed, really --- genuine Episcopalian, I was greatly impressed! These creative, unique articles captured my Imagination: "What is Power?" by Sam Keen; "Taking the First Step" by Anna Lappe`; "Accessing Sacred Energy," by Judith Orloff, MD; "The Making of a Chaplain" By Karen O'Brien (So like the pages of my earlier Verbatim in CPE). ---   --- "The Best Spiritual Books" are reviews of 50 out of 300 books by Fred and Mary Ann Brussat! We surely agreed on the first few named: "The Heart of Christianity" Marcus Borg; "Beyond Belief" Elaine Pagels; "The Wisdom Way of Knowing" Cynthia Bourgeault; ++ --- "The Lord is My Shepherd" Rabbi Kushner+ "The Power of Patience" by M J Ryan!   ---  --- I am still in the whirlwind of those emotionally stimulating, artistically written articles on varied yet potent topics of food for Thought and Reflection. Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood 
Most of the other reviews printed here I am in agreement with.  There is little I need to add except that I saw the film for the first time in the eighties when it came out on tape.  I just rewatched it and still find my gut reaction to be the same and then some.  Schlesinger's work, the three leads and the marvelous script make for an engrossing, sobering and disturbing treatise on how so many people lack values and seek "happiness" in all of the wrong places -- especially in the wrong people.  After the twenty-odd years of first viewing this film, I realized tonight how strong Julie Christie's performance is in this film.  There is not one hole in this bravura performance.  It's odd to make this statement, especially since she's playing such a shallow role.  It's not an easy nor a desirable part to play, but she carries it off as if she herself were the character.  Selfishness is at the core of the character as well as immaturity, and she stoops and conquers. ---  --- Laurence Harvey has never played the rogue better and Dirk Bogarde is perfect as the jilted lover who indeed possesses a heart, but nevertheless gives in (but not completely) to Ms. Christie's empty needs.  He, indeed, sees through her throughout most of the film but cannot help being swayed by her charms. ---  --- Emptiness served up brilliantly.  And we must respect the talents involved for providing us with a lesson -- as well as thank them (on two levels at least: talent coupled with making us examine what should really be of value to us)
It's nice and has yet to fall apart in 10 belly dancing classes.  The only thing is that every other triangle does not have coins, so you are only getting half as many coins as pictured.  However, for the price I would rather that than have it full of coins and falling apart. 
Simple and elegant earrings. My wife loves them.  However, the backs are a trifle small to work with. --- BA
THIS ITEM IS SUCH A HUGE HUNK OF JUNK! FIRST OFF THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE TOTALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FIGURE OUT AND SECOND OFF THE OUTSIDE TEMP IS ALWAYS OFF BY AT LEAST 12 DEGREES.
Even though Gordon Lui is the main reason you're buying this film, the story isn't bad either. Excellent training sequences and even better fighting sequences. My only complaint was a dragged out jail scene which lasts about 15 minutes. But that scene is not enough to tarnish this film. This is a solid film
These seat covers are allot prettier then the picture. Just recieved mine today and I am very pleased...
These are more of an accent light than task lights...not what I expected.  should have paid attention to other reviews
Fantastic pop up book!  Easy to keep the Preschool children's attention when telling this story
When I purchased mine, there was no Diaper Dekor+ which is the larger size.  However, I feel that we have no need for a larger one.  My child just turned two and it holds a weeks worth of diapers...no problem!  I bought the Diaper Genie because I was told so many things about it and I hate it, it goes through bags quickly and the bags have a weird odor to them.  I am currently pregnant and am sensitive to odors and the Diaper Dekor holds them all in until garbage day comes
We bought this bulk box because we drink a lot of tea...it's a great bargain if you're a tea drinker!!! :)
I got this camera about 2 years ago because my sd 200 broke. It is soooo easy to use and takes great pictures. Its also very sleek and small
explodes upon the crime-detective scene. THE HUNDRETH MAN, his first book was excellent and THE DEATH COLLECTORS is as good and even better. Can't wait for the next one! ---  --- Why this is an Amazon sale item befuddles me. But since it is , grab this bargain while you can because it is a terrific novel! ---  --- The PSIT team of LAPD, Carson Ryder and Harry Nautilus are faced with a dual-time mystery. More than 30 years in the past, a serial killer with a following of mesmerized women who adore him, is killed in the courtroom the day he is sentenced. ---  --- And NOW; starting with the grizzly find of a murdered prostitute in a seedy motel room...it seems as though the serial killer has risen from the dead to continue his reign of terror. Each time a new murder surfaces the killer is a step ahead and just out of reach of Carson and Harry. The touch of subtle humor adds bas-relief without taking anything away from the thread of the story and lightens it tension for brief seconds at a time.Perfect! ---  --- The murders are freakish! Disgusting! Brutal! But the two PSIT detectives refuse to give up and what finally unravels the twisted cloth of this old/new mystery will knock you out of your chair. ---  --- A truly masterfully plotted novel with two familiar and charismatic 'partners against crime'. A series to follow and enjoy. Get both of Kerley's books and double your pleasure! ---  --- Try them, you'll like them and you'll love Jack Kerley. I promise!!
I really think it's Simon's best.  This, and perhaps (in a very different style) "Paul Simon."  I'm just listening to it again after several years...the melodies are intricate, the words are vivid and allusive, the range is astounding.  Graceland has a wonderful rock-style going on, but I really think this is my favorite.  I know a lot of non-Simon fans who love this one album.  It's just fantastic
I am satisfied with the product.  For that matter I know it before I bought and I am satisfied with it.  The only glitch is it will take some time to start and until it starts we may not be able to browse or use any applications that needs internet.  Still I would suggest it is a best option to buy one for ur computer safety
Things that I like:  --- (1) The option to tile the front of the keyboard up makes typing much more comfortable.  I was a skeptic about it before I purchased it, but really do like it.  Also, this is the first keyboard that I have used that allows for so many typing angles.   --- (2) The included software gives a great deal of control over customizing all of the extra keys on the keyboard.  Even if you don't have Windows Vista, you can program the gadgets key to suit your needs.   --- (3) The keyboard has no lag for me, whatsoever.   --- (4) I'm a big fan of the standard 3x2 key setup for the home keys, etc.   --- (5) This is a small change, but I'm using this setup on Dell Inspiron 6000 laptop.  The software replaced the large volume notifications (onscreen display showing volume level, mute, etc.) with a smaller more attractive style notification.  Me gusta.   --- (6) The curved keyboard is also comfortable.  It requires no time nor effort getting used to it.   --- (7) I haven't had any problems with the keyboard being "out of range."   --- (8) For the mouse, I'm switching from the Wireless Intellimouse Explorer 3.0, which is also made by Microsoft, to the Laser 6000 mouse included.  This new mouse is more comfortable. (not a huge difference, but noticeable.)  It is also lighter, and slides around with little effort. ---  --- What I don't like: --- (1) The lock key above the number pad is set by default to display the same two options as when you click 'Start' then 'Log off Windows.'  I would have liked the option to change the key to the Shut Down / Hibernate dialog instead.  I haven't found that option available, so far. --- (2) The keyboard is a little bit wider than others, but I don't find it to be a problem.  It's just different.  Having the additional programmable buttons outweighs the downside of having the extra width. ---  --- Five Stars
this is the worst piece of junk i have ever purchased, i cant believe it, please dont waste your time or money on this, it b    roke the second day, rubber bands poped man what a piece of junk  i rate it a fat zero but i only had an option to give it a one
An absolute must have for all parents, families and professionals!  As a speech & language pathologist, I have worked with special needs children for 17 years, and finally I have viewed a high quality product for children diagnosed with Down Syndrome.  Informative, comprehensive and heart warming are just a few words to describe this excellent DVD.  I would highly recommend it for not only families, but for ALL professionals working with this population.  In fact, I believe it should be part of the training and curriculum for all disciplines intending to serve these wonderful children.  Thanks for a great product
No problem whatsoever with this product.  It was delivered in a timely manner and worked perfectly
I accidentally ordered this one instead of the Kolcraft Universal carrier, since they are both called the Universal carrier.  This car seat carrier is over-engineered with too many moving parts that are completely unnecessary.  Rather than returning it, my husband wanted to eat the $59.99 plus shipping by beating it up with a baseball hat.  We went out and purchased the Kolcraft Universal carrier-- it is much simpler, easier to fold, and has a large, functional basket underneath the car seat. 
Received my vanilla beans very quickly.  They arrived fresh, sealed well and exactly as we'd hoped
The Organizer works well for keeping disparate shopping items from rolling around in the back of the car.  I do wish the partitions were actually attachable by velcro to the organizer and soft.  The hard plastic partitions is this Organizer are simply square plates that can be stuck in between items.  I tend to not use them since they don't even work to soften the bumps between jossling items. My husband's trunk organizer (which I didn't buy because it cost 3x as much) has the softer, attachable partitions.  I guess that would be worth the money in retrospect for MY needs.  But in all this is great for the price. Now I get to the office, or home, and easily carry everything in at once to unload
I have a pair if clogs from Europe that I wear in the operating room.  I need to replace them.  They are European size 50.  So what's the deal?  You don't make your shoes in Men's sizes.  You think we all have girley feet?  Get with it, clowns.  Real men occasionally wear clogs too.  You can't make a size 16
hard to Believe that Sidney Poitier went from Directing a Classic Comedy like "Stir Crazy" to this Music Video not ready for MTV type of Film.very 80's Campy&it was Corny then as it is now
The author had a great idea, but he cherry-picked the available info about Superman and the writers to get the book to make sense. For example, Superman was originally written as a metaphor for Jews during WW2. Two Jewish guys, right at the end of WW2, write a story of a man that has to leave his homeworld b/c it's destroyed... etc, etc. ---  --- I'm not critiscizing this book b/c it has a religious message. I'm critiscizing it b/c the author clearly left out clear facts that work against his arguement. Otherwise, I disagree with anybody that says it is "just a comic." Superman has often reflected the current values and attitudes of a large swath of America
These wipes have more perfume in them than any wipe on earth.  They are about the same softness as the Kirkland brand, but cost a lot more.  And wooohoooo, they smell stronger than este lauder herself
Upon the joyful news that we were having a girl, my husband decided to invest in a new digital camera and a photo printer. The digital camera still works great--the printer is another matter. While this one prints beautiful pictures, the cost of ink far outweighs the beauty of them sometimes. ---  --- As we all know, this is how printer companies make their money, through the ink. Replacing every cartridge at once will run you about $75 at a time, give or take a few. The gray ink is used up the quickest, and has also been one of the hardest for us to find here locally. The main problem I have with this printer is that the quality is excellent after you replace the ink, but for only about the first 50-70 pictures. After that. The pictures take on too much of a magenta cast and start to get out of register--very frustrating when you're printing out any pictures, let alone ones of your child. Yes, we do what the manual sugests for such occasions, and the main one is to clean the printer cartridge heads, but this has only actually worked for us on one occassion. Every other time get us no results and we are still stuck with pictures that resemble something a third grader took a crayon to. In the long run, I will not be buying a photo printer for home use, but will rather take them to a store for processing.  ---  --- Quality-wise, it gets you in the beginning, but doesn't hold out for the long run. We have fiddled with it for two years. Enough's enough
When I first got my phone, I was quite excited.  It had more memory than my current Treo 650 however only after one day I noticed the battery life was draining much faster than I had anticipated.  From my research, I discovered a few things that needed to be done before I extend my battery life to more than 10 hours. --- 1)I had to apply a camera patch since my phone was manufactured prior to Jan 18th.  This patch can be found on Palm support site. ---  --- 2) I needed to completely drain my battery until there was nothing then charge it for 24 hours. ---  --- Once I did these two things, my phone has lasted for a few days without a charge, and I've set my versamail to retrieve messages when they arrive.  This is a big plus for me going from getting emails every hour to getting them when they arrive. ---  --- I've had no problems with any of my SD cards or mini-SD cards.  The increase internal memory also helps since I use my TomTom navigation with my Treo.  I've heard the various complaints, but you have to work through some of them.  it is a great phone
just to make the plot work.  Not very realistic.  If you want a realist cop character, try Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch.
Some of the other reviews have said that the film is not editted properly and 'too slow'. I'm not a film-maker and cannot comment on that other than to say that they are wrong. The film is amazing. I'm not sure if there is ANY other movie or documentary that shows what a serialkiller-cum-dictator-cum-statesman is like. Nowadays people might not know who Idi Amin is, or what he did, so its important to read up a little so you can truely appreciate this movie. He plays accordian? You see him meeting with his 'advisors' (some of whom disappear so after.) You see him play acting like a grown-up boy with toy soldiers. You see his self-appointed royal pedigree and send his support for Nixon! Its fascinating and amazing. This is man that, self-proclaimed, actually ATE some of his rivals (not the whole body I hope). He killed many people directly and by his policies. His ego is outstanding and its an amazing movie. Apparently, there is a new movies coming out about Idi Amin starring Forrest Whitaker. He's a good actor and so I look forward to seeing it. But this is the REAL guy. Its amazing and a feat probably never to happen again
If you own a Q, you know the battery life with the standard battery is horrible.  This charger also has a slot for a 2nd battery, which is great. So I can charge my phone with the standard battery, and have the extended one Verizon sells in the back slot. Never having to worry about battery life again. Also, it makes a wonderful stand for the phone, and when hooked to the USB cable, you get data conectivity too.  Only downside, it won't charge the extended battery until the phone is fully charged.
i bought this mic online for $150 new. i researched for a while and decided this was the best option. i use a canon GL2 and this is a nice addition to my rig. ---  --- at first i didnt think the audio was all that great, however, when i turned on the microphone attenuate feature of my camera and switched to the manual audio controls, i found that this mic has a lot of potential. with the attenuate on, you can really get clear audio without outside noise messing up your tracks. i pointed the mic at an actor on screen, then pointed the mic away from the actor and you could definetly here a difference in audio detail. ---  --- note: the mic has two different posistions to mount the hot shoe mount, a standard tripod mount, and an addition threaded hole which rode claimes to be a microphone stand mount. my mic stand doesnt thread into this hole, and i consider my mic stand to be pretty standard. however their may be some adapters at my local music store. not a big issue to consider, as there are plenty of mounting options available
This cable saves me a lot of money. I don't need to buy stuff online when now I can download it straight to my PC. makes it easy to transfer Pictures, videos, ring tones, contact numbers. It is great to put things on and off. Also great for keeping a back up
Ya tengo una semana con el y lo recomiendo ampliamente La imagen y la nitidez de este monitor son sobresalientes Con una resolucion de 1680 x 1050 las fotos tomadas con mi camara digital se ven como una imagen real Tiene varios ajustes segun el uso que le quieras dar Viene en español
I bought a 5lb. bag of these actually, and left my groceries near my desk at work.  Bad move.  My boss, ever the degenerate gambler, decided the best way to entertain himself on a slow day at work, was to have some of us engage in an onion-eating-contest.  Thankfully, the mild and slightly sweet taste of "Fresh Spanish Onions" helped me persevere over my opponent, an intern who we will refer to only as "Will C."  His choice of red onions cost him the match, as well as a date with Carol from accounting (to say nothing of the mess he had to clean up in the men's room, and his doctor's subsequent recomendation that he get a colostomy).  I'd like to thank Bill from Produce at Gristedes for his suggestion of "Fresh Spanish Onions"-- I owe ya one, buddy.  Now if only I could get my sense of smell back
When I considered purchasing this product, I was confused to see that some people thought it was great, and others thought it was terrible.  I couldn't understand why there were such discrepancies in the reviews. ---  --- After I bought it I understood: For some of the things it does, it works fine -- no problems.  However, there are many major bugs in the software, and if you need one of the buggy functions, you'll be sorry you bought it. ---  --- Examples of some problems:  ---  --- 1. If you burn an audio track entitled "Blue Fog" Nero will give it the title "Fog." ---  --- 2. Every time I run a backup, it tells me there was a write error, but the backup seems OK. ---  --- 3. I backed up every file on my drive, but when my system crashed, there were problems that prevented me from restoring my system. ---  --- 4. It has blue screened my system one time. ---  --- 5. Many commands are poorly or not at all documented.  For example, the wave editor has a declipper function, but there is no documentation on how to use it. ---  --- So, I'd recommend that you look instead at a competing product. ---  --- Good luck
I Purchased this product in Nov 2006. Reviews at other sites indicated this was a wonderful product, the very best, editor reviews - not user - the product is to new I guess. I looked at the specs and it had features which looked very appealing, so I thought I would try it - Bummer. Acronis 10 installs fine, sets up a file system on a seperate physical drive and appears to work, until you verify the images, all are corrupted. I have contacted Acronis several times, they have given me several test tools to find out what might be wrong.  Nothing has been resolved after 4 1/2 months. The tools and debuging has shown no errors in my hardware.  I have to keep using Ghost-2003 to do my images, it works fine. Acronis support acts like its a unheard of problem, but I now find references all over the Internet about this image corruption problem going back to version 6
I'm a Wiccan who formally practices within a traditional Gardnerian coven, but practices eclectically within my private practice. I read this book because I had heard that it was recommended to my local library by a Christian; purportedly, Wicca's Charm was written by an impartial writer. Immediately, you realize that this isn't true. Catherine Sanders has a clearly stated agenda: that Wiccans are simply misguided and  misunderstand that what they long for is offered by Christianity.  ---  --- I could write a long review debating the merits of Sanders' arguments. Instead, I suggest that you consider this if deciding whether to read this book which Sanders claims to have thoroughly researched. She relies on the writings of Margot Adler, Carol Christ, Starhawk and Phyllis Curott (with barely a nod to Scott Cunningham and Ronald Hutton) to draw many of her conclusions. Yet, missing from her notes are such writers as the Farrars, Merlin Stone, Raymond Buckland, Isaac Bonewits, Patricia Crowley, and the Matthews, to name just a few outstanding contributors to Neopaganism's base of knowledge.  ---  --- Too often, Sanders relies on the statements of young Wiccans she interviewed who come across as silly and naive. In another case, she bases her thesis that women's spirituality (e.g., Goddess worship)is misguided and that Christianity fits the same spiritual needs that women are seeking via ONE speech that she heard Margot Adler give shortly after 9/11.  ---  --- Sanders requests both Christians and Neopagans to read her book with an open mind. A fair request. But as you're reading, closely check out her endnotes and analyze for yourself if this book was truly researched with objectivity in mind, or whether Sanders limited herself to sources that would support her belief that Christianity has everything that a Wiccan desires. One needs to go no further than to consider that as Sanders attempts to persuade the reader that Christianity has always embraced the value of women that not once does she analyze the epistles of Paul.
I was barely able to finish this book. Armstrong makes fun of vampires and witches, etc. by dragging in all the cheesy pop culture references she can think of. This made it very hard for me to take her characters seriously. I might have been able to swallow the idea of Cabals (giant glitzy corporations run by sorcerors; it's unclear why they don't just take over the world and have done), but Armstrong really lost me during the 20-page extended send-up of Anne Rice's vampires. This genre is rapidly sinking into self-referentialism, and Armstrong is the worst culprit. In Industrial Magic, she ruins what could have been a perfectly good story with these unfunny namechecks and rebuttals to writers who are actually better than she is. On top of that, the viewpoint character, Paige, is unfortunately named: she's as flat and boring as the pages she's written on. Her central relationship is with her boyfriend, Lucas, but their coupleship seems to revolve around the trading of sexual favors. Are we supposed to think this is cute and funny?  ---  --- Take-home project for Armstrong: next time, try putting some genuine emotion into your work
I very much like these earrings.  My only reason for not giving them a 5-star rating is that the topaz is quite small.  You really have to look closely to see it.  But, they are excellent quality sterling silver and still beautiful.  I recommend them, just be aware that the stones are tiny
My fiance (now wife) and I have been looking for a workable solution for the hair down under.  She has tried waxing - too painful - and shaving would cause a lot of bumps and irritation, even with the Shick Intutition.  Her pubic region was basically living on Neosporen, Bikini Zone, and Gold Bond (not together and not in any particular order).  We also tried scissors, but that was hard to negotiate, if you will, in the more intimate of areas.  At this point she was seriously thinking laser hair removal, but wasn't ready to pony up the $$ and commit to an irrevocable decision.  Although, based on the other posts here and accepted fashion trends, I highly doubt that an "au natural massive overgrowth" will be in style. ---  --- The trimmer is great.  Yes, Amazon should take down the photo of the storage pouch.  Yes, it won't get you totally smooth or bald.  But it is a well built TRIMMER, which is painless and easy to use.  You can adjust the length you want, and you can easily work around the more sensitive and intimate southern locations.   ---  --- Just take it easy around the labia minora and remember to use a mirror.  If you want the smooth look, use this handy device before you break out the razor and shaving cream/lotion. It makes it much easier and cuts down on irritation. ---  --- I suppose, although we have no interest in it, that you can get creative with styling your pubic hair into shapes and designs.  Hey what ever works for you and/or you an your partner
Great magazine. Covers the full range of .NET technologies. Every issue is packed with windows, web, and xml development articles plus industry news and a lot more. High recomended
This FUGIFILM PADDED SOFT CASE is strong, durable and very attractive. It was more than I expected. It is very professional looking
You know right away your teeth feel different, much like how they feel after a dentist cleaning. ---  --- The dual action (larger) head is gentler and feels more like a normal toothbrush but it certainly isn't as aggressive as the smaller one in it's ability to clean. If you can handle the smaller heads they certainly do a better job. The flossing attachment was also very effective
Bands from the 90s just sucked and Nirvana fits in with that. They had a couple of ok songs and Kurt Cobain was some what talented but this is nothing to get excited about. I can not for the life of me see the things people see that just go off about how great they were. I don't see it. This is another cd in a long line of cds from the 90s that are a disgrace to music.
I have played through Fable and The Lost Chapters several times. All in all, this is a very fun game. The classic RPG elements of leveling up, buying or finding new and better weapons and armor, choosing to focus on magic use or hack and slash, and choosing to be good or evil are all included in Fable. The graphics are superb for its time, and the voice acting is top notch. In addition, the storyline is quite good, and is more complex than the average RPG 'save the world' tale. I have heard some complaints of Fable being too short, but if you take all the quests and max out all levels, the game length should be just fine (unless you are expecting a 50+ hours Morrowind experience). ---    Where Fable loses some points is the controller setup. The button configuration can be overwhelmingly complex, so much so that finding yourself using an item you did not mean to use can be a frequent occurance. In addition, you may find yourself using magic at an inopportune time, simply because you pressed the R trigger by mistake. The bow aiming feature might pop on at a bad time (like when you are being attacked by 4 creatures), and while rotating the camera view, the map pop-up might fill your screen as you are in the midst of battle (thus obscuring your view). ---   Also, Fable does tend to have some save problems. You may complete some quests and save, and upon reloading, the quests may have to be recompleted, or worse, may not have been saved and will not be offered again!  ---    Still, these are rather minor complaints. While Fable really doesn't live up to its advertising of being an all-immersive RPG, it is quite good, and a blast to play if you like D&D styled RPG's. If you like Zelda games but wish they were more adult, definitely check out Fable
The casting for this production could scarcely be better (of particular note is the harrowing performance of Judi Dench) and it's one of Shakespeare's best plays. That said, this film of a production on stage doesn't quite carry the viewer's interest for the entire play. There are times when the actors seem downright pretentious; you feel as if they're tellings us, "We know how deep this is so appreciate it, please." That's too bad since "Macbeth" is a work thriving with intense imagination with a few hallucinations thrown in so it should invite a great film. Sadly, this relatively slow-moving production isn't it. There are, of course, wonderful moments with Mackellan and particularly Dench (no one plays the scene where Lady Macbeth goes crazy better than Dame Judi). I just don't know if that alone makes this a worthwhile purchase. For my money, Kurosawa's "Throne of Blood" is a far better choice.
I purchased this commentary for an in-depth study that I was doing on Wednesday evenings.  I carefully checked a bunch of commentaries on Amazon, hoping to find the one that would help me with insights that I could share in the study. ---  --- Unfortunately, this volume hasn't lived up to my hopes.  I didn't need something that would offer the obvious points (I can do that myself).  I was hoping for something that would offer insights into some of the more difficult and confusing passages, including thoughts on how those passages apply to our lives today.  I've been disappointed.  I am now well into the study and rarely even check the book anymore as I'm gathering information. ---  --- I was between this one and the Carson commentary.  Obviously, I think I made the wrong decision.  (Not that there's anything theologically wrong in the text - it's just not what I was hoping for.
GREAT PRODUCT! This tool is very intuitive and easy to use. I find the greatest value is in having the MIL codes internal to the device, which makes finding the faulty component right at your fingertips. I bought the OBDII Fault code book, but quickly learned that I didn't need to have it
Not what I expected.  The box was handmade, the instructions were some other tool.  I have contacted seller and was not satisfied with response
I've had this camera for three years.  I bought it new, when it was cutting edge and very expensive.  I put a 128MB CF card in it. ---  --- First, I have to say that I have NEVER had the slightest problem with this camera or the software.  I've probably taken upwards of 5000 pictures with it, it's been all over the country.  The software has been installed on Windows 95, 98, 2000 and XP and I haven't had any problems with it.  The camera is solid, performs well, takes good pictures, and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the LCD viewfinder. If battery life were that big a deal, one could purchase a second battery and rotate. ---  --- All that said, I am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera.  They are razor sharp, the color balance is perfect, and the focus is great.  When taking pictures of people, however, it shows EVERY flaw in the subject's skin.  Scratches, oil, freckles are magnified and come out looking horrific.  It requires extensive Photoshopping to fix the flaws.  Other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better.   ---  --- I will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture. By the time the shot's taken, something (especially a squirmy child or a sports play) has invariably moved and it's not the exact picture you wanted. ---  --- I'm going to buy a real Single-Lens Reflex (SLR) to take baby pictures, but I'll keep this as a travel camera
This band is getting alot of critical acclaim right now, but I'm just not feeling it. The single "Wolf like me" is the only song that stands out to me on the whole album. It is a great song, but everything else is just blah. I think the band could use a different singer, the guy they got doesn't sing very well or very "soulful". The music is good, very original and the only reason I haven't sold the cd yet. I really think ppl need to hear this one for themselves before they buy. Don't be fooled by these 5 star reviews. Just listen to the cd before you buy it. That's my advice
The new office 2007 is completely revamped from older versions and is well worth the four year wait. ---  --- +'s --- 1.New Interface with improved accessibility to all features, you can reach all the features that were hidden away inside those menus and no need to memorize the menu contents/options. --- 2. If you are a developer you can write your own custom panes using Visual Studio. --- 3. Great Plug-ins (like the save as PDF/XPS thing available as a free dwnld), massive clip-art/template library. ---  --- -s --- 1.Overpriced by about 40%. Somwhere around 250-300 wud have been the right price for the Pro Edition. --- 2. Some backward compatability issues with the document formats and templates and doesn't work with Adobe Acrobat as of now
My kids grew up overseas and are quite familiar with Renaissance paintings. They've seen many of these paintings and are very familiar with them. I realize this is not the typical situation. ---  --- I was disappointed that the game is basically a game of luck. It is not challenging or reinforcing of our kid's knowledge. I had hoped for a game like "Famous Authors" which builds on and tests the level of knowledge of the players.  ---  --- Nonetheless, the game is well presented. It's on the expensive side, but the book alone is worth half the price. Looking for a fancy gift with cultural overtones? I recommend this
The nippits didn't really work for me and they were painful to remove
This CD is great.  It is a must have.  Picture yourself in the wild or on a lake in a boat and a thunderstorm comes rolling in slowly.  You hear the rain, the thunder in the distance, you sense the storm getting closer.  The storm is over head, loud piercing thunder claps and you duck for cover.  The thunderstorm slowly moves out but the rain is a constant presents.  The thunder rolls on but the wild life moves in, bullfrogs, owls in the distance, all the animals are alive now.  This cd is all in one, the real deal.  It is not all thunder.  I love it.  I also bought Thunderstorm [Rykodisc]; this was a waste of money.  To me, in my opinion it sounds like the storm just knocked the cable out, static and more static. 
Wow, this was awful! The best thing about this DVD is that it doesn't last long. My boyfriend and I sat down to watch this together (in the mood to begin with) and both of us were completely turned off by it. The woman is not even naked, and wears a nightie throughout the DVD. She also is extremely hairy (a matter of personal taste I know, but this was very extreme). The tone of it was decidedly unsexy, more of a strictly how-to than a way to excite the watcher(s). It seemed to me to be very low-budget and unimaginative. Spend your money on something else if you're looking for sexual excitement..
Man, have I given this guy a chance.  Multiple chances.  Listened to the CDs, saw the big HBO special.  I mean, his career is red hot now.  He clearly has lots of fans.  Mostly college age (perhaps this should be a warning to some of you).  All I can say is "maybe they'll grow out of it."  He is NOT funny.  His act has no bite, no point of view, no opinion/viewpoint at all.  His comedy consists of spewing observations his audience can relate to (the "this is all happened to us" or "has this ever happened to you?" school of humor).  He runs about manically, acting out every little word that comes out of his mouth (for those in the audience that may not be so good with words).  His fans acknowledge that, yes, they can relate.  "Yeah!  That's happened to me!"  "I know that reference!'  They laugh, cheer, clap, and plunk down their hard-earned dollars for his vanilla wit.  He never actually COMMENTS on the things he discusses in any intelligent, interesting way.  He has no edge.  He's not outraged by anything.  He's cute 'n' cuddly.  Richard Pryor must be rolling in his grave at the very fact that Cook is classified as a stand up comic.  "Pryor?  The guy writing this must be OLD!'  Okay, try this on for size:  Chris Rock is good comedy.  Same with Dave Chappelle.  Carlin.  Laura Kightlinger.  Kinison.  Rodney Dangerfield.  Bob Saget.  Gilbert Gottfried.  Dom Irrera.  Lewis Black.  Robert Klein.  The late Mitch Hedberg.  Jim Norton.  Patton Oswalt.  Brian Posehn.  DeGeneres.  Jon Stewart.  Bob & David.  The UCB.  I'm not even a big fan of Sarah Silverman, but at least she's trying to bring something different to the party.  Anything but this!  God help us.  Let's hope he goes the way of Carrot Top and Dice soon (don't forget, Cook fans, Mr. Top and Mr. Clay were once as popular as your boy here)
If you like physics, this is just an interesting book. It mostly discusses, at length, two ideas: emergence and reductionism. Doesn't sound like much, and it isn't, but at least it gives you a different point of view on the world. Unfortunately, from this point of view to the horizon is not that far. Mr. McLaughlin almost calls the present theories (like string theory) science fiction, easy on science (because of the scales and energies involved, he seems to think they are not provable; I don't have the knowledge to discuss if he is right or not), but he doesn't offer much of an alternative. He even comes close to saying that deeper levels of understanding are not possible, or not practical.  --- Well, even if he is right, which I hope he isn't, between can't and science fiction, I prefer science fiction. Tomorrow I'll read a bit of string theory, and shake off the depressive mood left by this book
I bought this for my daughter when she was 2. I agree with the other reviewer about the weight of the product. It is so heavy that it can actually hurt a child if it turns over. I still let my daughter play with it but only when she's being supervised around it. And I have to make sure that the toy is not on any type of unstable ground. There are other good shape sorters out there - I wouldn't waste the money on this one because of the potential safety hazard.
Most annoying thing is that I hooked up through HDMI for 2 of my components however this receiver requires you too also hook audio connections as well if using the HDMI (I used optical). What the hell is the deal with that? At first I thought that maybe if you do that then the receiver wont have to be on to have sound output to your TV or something but nope no sound if the system is turned off as well. HDMI is supposed to make it more convenient, 1 cable etc... why is this necessary???????  --- Secondly my receiver is not working properly. The sound output to the rear speakers is low volume and garbled 99% of the time. Running the auto MACC fails out, manually I see that it outputs surround right speaker to the front right speaker????? Nothing is hooked up to this output on the receiver so nothing should be outputting at all during this part, surround left is silent as it should be.  Occasionally the right rear speaker will blast out 3 times louder then it supposed to be.  Adjusting the volume takes it back down to the low garbled norm. If I select the different output options, basically pushing buttons for no reason sometimes the audio will be correct and does sound amazing.  --- I am current in process to return my faulty receiver for a replacement as I do think the receiver is nice if its working, I enjoy the IPOD dock that has output to your tv as well. --- I major concern is something is wrong with there HDMI circuitry and causing my problems and the replacement will be bad as well. I will update when I get the replacement installed.
The Jerdon 7P7506CF (or as I call it, the ol'6CF) is a nice, reflective wall-attachable mirror.  I can't say enough about how reflective this thing is; I'm a bit of an amateur facepainter (although I have zero artistic ability- my Spider-Man faces usually end up looking like spotty tomatoes), so I need a good mirror whenever I self-paint.  I have gone through three similar models before finding the 6CF, and none has been as clear and user-friendly. ---  --- In short, if you're looking for the best mirror value for your dollar, I can't recommend this thing enough.  It's the mirror of the 21st century, and beyond
If I could give less than 1 star for any Trend Micro product I would. It gives too many false positives when you don't even have a virus. You are going nuts trying to find where the virus is and there is not even one there as Trend told you there was. Avoid this like the plague and save your hard earned money. It's a piece of crap.
Immediately upon starting Dickens' "Our Mutual Friend," I was struck by parallels with Dumas' "The Count of Monte Cristo."  Both big novels revolve around a powerful character who conceals his identity in a complicated plot to obtain social justice.  The Count deals with the darker theme of revenge.  Our Mutual Friend is an exploration of the corrupting influence of wealth. ---  --- The novel is lively throughout, as  Dickens displays his tremendous diversity of writing talents.  The tone ranges from heavily ironic criticism of upper-class politics and antisemitism, to delicate romance, to witty visual humor.  The characterizations are highly original; even those at the extremes of vice and virtue display engaging ideosyncracies. ---  --- Most impressive to me was the consistency of Dickens' plot.  Our Mutual Friend was written and published in installments, as was The Count of Monte Cristo.  But Dickens keeps his story on track throughout, never dropping a character, while Dumas' tale is full of gaps and inconsistencies
Smells DIVINE! This is a powder-sweet and refreshing scent that won't overwhelm the senses. It's soft and subtle, yet killer if it complements your body chemistry. I love using this particular fragrance (especially during special occasions). It exudes both simplicity and sophistication--wonderful qualities that make me feel so feminine and utterly sexy!!! Try it
I'm a culinary historian and author (CALIFORNIA PIONEERS, their stories, culture and cuisine)who spends a lot of time delving into the pages of history, especially food history. When I want to give my burned-out peepers a break, I reach for this magazine. ---  --- As much as I love the food articles -- mostly because, as great as they look, realistically they are quite do-able for just about anyone -- what I really find useful is the "Ask Martha" column in which practical answers are given to problems readers write in about. ---  --- And then there are the craft projects...I have tried several and was surprised by my success. I credit this to the well laid-out photos and very clear instructions.  ---  --- My advice is, if you are looking for a magazine that touches on every aspect of living and enjoying a well-designed (and I do not mean "haughty") lifetsyle, then you cannot go wrong with Martha Stewart Living. ---  --- Also, the special holiday ideas are the best ever...makes one wonder, how do they keep coming up with such unique ideas that are do-able for the general population?[...
The foil is a bit misleading, because if you are shaving parts of your body with many curves (under the zipper) the timmer will catch you and it hurts, a lot. The foil can ONLY be used on straight surfaces. The two trimmer blases rest at about a 200degree angle. If you have to many curves to mow with the foil without hitting the trimmer.... well, be prepared to spend a night or two on the sofa
I have found that the MS-5700 to be very loud. The Braun 8995 that I replaced it with is very quiet. The plastic chrome on the body gives it a very cheap feel, and look, it makes it hard to hold onto. I have found that the shaver dosn't give me a very close shave compared to the Braun 8985 shaver. The solution tank for the cleaner seems to be not as user friendly as the Braun 8985 that holds a cartridge that slips in and out to replace. As you have read I have replaced the MS-5700 already with the Braun 8985, and am very happy with the change. The Braun also came with 3 cartridges for the cleaner unit, not just one bottle to pour into the cleaner.
The mirror's light is quite dim and the magnification (5x)is inadequate for most purposes
Sorry, but this movie BLEW!  The premise was there, but the delivery just sucked.  I can only take the suspension of belief so far.  We are supposed to believe that this guy has never told his new gf (whom he's been w/for at least a year) about his last, one before that, and gf before that.  At least two of them have his home phone number: they've never called? She's never seen the caller ID?  She's never answered the phone? Give me a break!  THen she holds fake interviews with the exes and just opens up the most ridiculous can of worms. She meets up with Joyce (the most recent) whom she finds out that she genuinely likes, and starts believing that the bf should really be with her.  Joyce is none the wiser, but if you ask me, Joyce had stalker qualities b/c she harassed him when he was with the model, calls his house right back when she gets the call on her phone, keeps that stupid boomerang IN A FRAME, etc.   ---  --- This chick, Stacy (Brittany M) had to be incredibly stupid not to see where this was ultimately going. Holly Hunter's character is precisely why I have more male friends than female. Stacy just met this woman and she's revealing all these things about her personal life and this woman is all too happy to help her wallow in the craziness of this movie. I never expected the 'big climax,' but I did ask myself several times "will this Barb (HH) chick back the **** off?!"   ---  --- On to the climax:it was actually a surprise, but what blew me was that everything ended up honky dory for Stacy...after she humiliated all those people. I never got the impression that the bf (Derrick) was cheating on her, yet that tacky talk show would have made you think different.  The ONLY reason he pissed me off was because he didn't read STacy the riot act in the end. ---  --- This movie tries to wax philosophical, and you just end up hating all of the characters...except for the dog.   ---  --- A very passible movie.  I wouldn't even bother.
Canon makes a great underwater housing for a reasonable price.  I purchased this for a recent trip to Grand Cayman and Cozumel.  I didn't go Scuba diving on this trip, but I did take the camera snorkeling (diving to depths ~20ft).  It worked flawlessly and I got some pictures I was very happy with!  One thing I did not anticipate was the use the camera got out of the water.  Going from AC to the hot humid outdoors, my EOS rebel fogged up (condensation) and even after 30 minutes I couldn't take good pictures.  With the SD110 in the UW housing, I just wipped the housing's glass portal with a lens tissue after it had warmed up a couple of minutes and I was able to take clear pictures.  ---  --- The instructions are pretty good, but it took me a while to figure out how to take out the O-ring seal for cleaning/lubing.  Once I figured it out, it wasn't so hard. ---  --- The SD110 may be getting a little old, but it still takes decent pictures and even with the housing I don't have so much money tied up in the system that I would be devestated if it was lost or stolen.  I will probably upgrade to the SD550 or SD500 (they both use the same batteries as the SD110) with the WP-DC80 or WP-DC70 housing at some time in the near future, but I will definitely keep the SD110 and WP-DC10 as backups
For around $20. dollars you could save your life and the ones you love. ---    This is super easy to use....both the transmitter & reciever run on batteries so there's no installation. I put mine on my back porch so when --- I open the door to let my dogs out at night for a quick run nobody will --- be there to surprise me. People who keep dogs for protection are fooling themselves. But these units are perfect. I've had mine for several days --- and NOT once has it gone off for no reason....but it HAS sounded every time it should have. The range is even better then I expected. Only two things I'd change. Why the LED on the transmitter? I taped a dime over mine so it doesn't show. Why alert intruders they're being watched? And --- it would be nice if the reciever could be plugged into an AC outlet to save on batteries. I have ordered a second one because this little device really gives me peace of mind
I HAD NEVER TRIED ANYTHING FROM PHILOSOPHY AND WANTED TO TRY THE 3 IN 1 STUFF, AND I THOUGHT THE LAVENDAR POUND CAKE WOULD SMELL REALLY GOOD. I WAS ACTUALLY REALLY DISAPPOINTED. IT SUCKS AS A SHAMPOO, AND BODY WASH TOO- I ORDERED THE BLUEBERRY PIE TOO, AND I HAVEN'T EVEN USED IT, ITS JUST SITTING IN MY CLOSET. FOR THE PRICE YOU GET A LOT AND LASTS LONG, BUT I WASN'T IMPRESSED
cases very cheaply made. Break when opening. Not worth shipping cost waste of money
Musicals are historically slight in the plot department, and this movie is no exception.  Three stars: one fading, one rising and one coasting do not help matters either. ---  --- Rita is the fading star.  It was painful for me to watch the once dazzling love goddess reduced to playing the controlling widow.  The make up department probably had to work overtime trying to cover the circles under her eyes, and her hair and costumes are just bad.  Novak is the rising star, although I don't get the 50's obsession with bubble headed, busty, bleach blond bimbos.  It would help if she could act, but sadly her range is very limited. I truly believe they added the dog to help make her character sympathetic, since she was unable to convey it herself.  Then there is Frank just coasting on his charm and cool.  Doesn't seem plausible that a hep cat like him, who could bag any "doll", "dame" or "mouse?", would fall for either of these gals. ---  --- Anyway, I gave it 2 stars because of Snuffy the dog.  He stole every scene he was in.  Although that wasn't too difficult to do in such a dog of a movie
We got this as an 11th birthday present for one of my daughter's friends.  It was the hit of the birthday party -- all the girls went home with new yarn belts, and my daughter, who can already knit a little, asked if she could have one, too.  The colors of yarn are bright and the texture is easy to work with.  For our purposes, this was a great birthday present
This is one fantastic grill. It is easy to ignite and heats up faster than Death Valley in July. Cleaning is easy with removable parts. For maximum effect, I suggest some type of grill cleaner to dissolve the carbonized left overs. That will make your BBQ look like new. There's some assembly required which took us about twice as long as the directions say it should, but once you taste your steaks and burgers, you will never be sorry you made the purchase.
This is a great beginner's guide to home buying.  The advice is straightforward and the explanations are easy to understand.  ---  --- Buying a home is a scary and daunting prospect for me.  I kept getting a lot of conflicting advice from relatives, friends, and coworkers on when to buy, what to buy, and how to buy.  This is very frustrating as everyone means well, but what worked for them might not apply to me. And don't bother asking a realtor or mortgage company if you should buy--they make their living on our decisions to buy!  ---  --- So I bought Home Buying for Dummies to learn more, and it has a lot of sound and thoughtful guidance to help decide when and how much to buy...  And also how to find a good home, and then negotiate with the realtors, the sellers, the mortgage companies, and everyone else that is sticking their hands in your wallet.   ---  --- The author's advice is realistic, and he points out the pitfalls of jumping in and what trouble you can get into with the different loan options out there
I gave my father-in-law a couple ideas for my son's (1 year old) Christmas gift and this was one of the items. Boy do I regret giving him this as an idea. It is a cheaply constructed toy. The bus's hood doesn't even work correctly. The toy does not do much of interest and it constantly makes this annoying noise! The toy held my son's attention for less than 5 minutes. My suggestion to anyone considering this toy is there are many more worthwhile toys on the market- skip this one
Patton Oswalt is funny and my two stars is not because of his performance. It's because of Comedy Central mangling the DVD version. ---  --- The show was originally broadcast on Comedy Central, and as such it was cut down to about 40 minutes so it could fill a one-hour time slot with commercials.  ---  --- The DVD has the original show, and then in the bonus section, it has "deleted scenes," which are the parts of the full-length concert that were cut for time.  ---  --- So, you can watch the time-edited show, or you can watch the out-of-context segments that were taken out. But what you can't do, and what I have to think any chimpanzee able to use sign language would know you would want to do, is see the original full-length show in its entirety. ---  --- So, cheers for Patton, boos for CC. I won't be buying the DVD and that's why.
Good special effects for that time period.  Served its purpose to boost the morale of the American public during 1943.  The heroic acts by those in the U.S. military at that time should always be remembered.  Outgunned and outmanned they held their own, and then some on Wake Island and in the Philippines. ---  --- However, the writers and producer play it pretty loose as far as historical accuracy was concerned.  No B-17s ever flew from Hawaii to Wake Island and on to Clark Field in the Philippines after the attack on Pearl.  I believe it is common knowledge that no B-17s ever sank the Japanese fleet advancing on the Philippines.  Remember Colin Kelly? ---  --- What was laughable was the scene where the Mary Ann makes an emergency landing on Maui instead of Hickam Field on Dec 7th.  Upon landing they're fired upon by local island Japanese.  Throughout the movie there are references to sabatoge committed by Japanese Americans in Hawaii on Dec 7th 1941.  Upon landing at Hickam Field ("because the Japs on Maui were shooting at us") a colonel goes on about Japanese vegetable trucks driving onto the runway at Hickam and crashing the tails of rows of P-40s before the attack.  Never happened.  In truth, there were no acts of sabatoge committed by the Japanese population in Hawaii.   ---  --- This movie only serves to perpetuate the common belief that Japanese-Americans were disloyal and unpatriotic citizens during WWII, when in fact this was not the case.  It should be noted that a good number of Japanese-Americans (many of whom were thrown into prison camps after Dec 7th) died fighting for the United States during WWII in order to prove their loyalty to this country. ---  --- May I suggest people watch the movie "Go For Broke" after watching Air Force to educate themselves on what "really" happened in WWII
We bought this item for my Daughter's Christmas present and the strings do not work at all.  All it does is play the 3 songs, and the microphone works.  But the other functions (anything to do with the strings) do not work at all.  We bought this at Toys R Us and we're taking it back tomorrow.  As I can see from the reviews (which I wish I'd read earlier), we'll be getting a different brand of guitar.  These seem faulty as a rule.  Do not buy this
Are they the best no.. Do they impress people who havent hear them before YES!! To me thats the best compliment, they are much more objective listeners --- with no preconcived notions. All I ever hear is " Those speakers sound so Good" " I love those cool little speakers" etc. I've played everything from Bach to Dio and they sound very realistic. Subwoofer placement is key to having the proper bass level. At [...] they are a steal.. I paid [...]in 1991 and listen to them everyday they still sound like they did when new.
I used to wear lame-ass Y-fronts when I was a kid and my boring folks did all the shopping. I made the switch to thongs after I got a girlfriend and she made it clear that I had to ditch the grandpa undies. So I did, and gladly! There's no way I could go back to this 'maxi' sh*t anymore. I tried one of my old pairs a few months ago and they look freakin HUGE!! I'm talking fat-guy big. You don't realize how big they are until you try modern stuff. So here's my advice: if you're still putting up with either boxers or briefs throw them in the trash right now and go buy something smaller. You'll be happy you did
I had great hope for this product.  It has, mostly, so far, lived up to my expectations.  Here are some caveats... ---  --- I was hoping for the ability to set up music catagories...easy listening, dinner music, light jazz...etc.  You have to "cheat" to do this, and using the manual is daunting.  Instead of using the "Artist" as artist, I used it as a catagory code, ie making one artist light jazz, etc.  This works, but you do, of course lose the artist registration ability. ---  --- So now, I can select "artist" "Dinner Music" and then "All Discs" and "Shuffle", and the unit will play a track from one "Dinner Music" CD then shuffle to another track on another "Dinner Music" CD, etc, making a delightful, mix of music that never is repeated exactly the same way. ---  --- I am still in the loading phase of coexistance with this machine, so longetivty, and flawlessness are not being reviewed here.  That remains to be seen. ---  --- The manual is purely awfull.  Just dig in and try things.  That's the only way to get a handle on things.  Hope this helps....good luck! --- 
This was very dissapointing!! my daughter was so excited to get it and could barely use it. the mat is supposed to be color coordinated with the screen however the colors seem to be all the same shade. The mat looks like it comes from the dollar store, or they ran out of color at the factory. My daughter asked her sister why mommy got this ugly one....not like the box or commercial!
im 14 and i go to school.... i bought this watch because I got a nice allowence and wow THE PEOPLE AT SCHOOL THINKS IM RICH AND COOL:!!!!!
eddie murphy is a comical guy, but is he really the right guy to play in something as stupid as this? Of course, who is the right guy for it? One of the questions i can't stand to think about in this movie, is how Dolittle hears the animals speak, but their lips move and nobody notices. Can't they connect the dots? Obviously not. And obviously, the filmmakers couldn't either
I purchased a package for window xp in may this year and just got a computer on which I wanted to use it. On Thursday Nov. 25, we wanted install it but the boot disk # 4 was observed to be problematic and thus the whole installation was not successful. ---  --- Please advice me. ---  --- Thanks  ---  --- Rev, Ndorle
I was excited to receive the product however it did not fit my laptop.  Everytime I opened the lid a POPPING sound would occur.  Turns out the rear right back panel was rubbing the lid casing.  I took the laptop out and placed it back in thinking it was not properly installed, same issue. ---  --- I'm not telling anyone not to buy this product.  Just be cautious.. and I hope you have better luck then I did
my review is written here only for seekers of obscure nine inch nails songs. for a full review of the soundtrack in its entirety read elsewhere-there are many other reviews. --- i have all 19 halos, and exclusive and unreleased remixes and demos, and i love all of it, including the entirety of the fragile, fixed, perfect drug versions, still, further down the spiral v1 and v2, the deluxe edition of the downward spiral, on and on, everything.... --- except deep. --- deep is truly the only nine inch nails song not worth having. --- painfully uninspired and recycled, musically, lyrically, and visually (the video was an embarassment- again, the only one in a catalogue of otherwise disturbing, beautiful brilliance), DEEP is a song and phase trent himself has admitted to wishing to forget entirely. --- my advice: take it as a mark that he is, after all, human, but leave it here on the tomb raider soundtrack, unpaid for, for it will never show up on an official halo as burn (originally for natural born killers), dead souls (joy division cover originally for the crow), and the perfect drug (originally for lost highway) all have in time (the former two on halo 8 DE and the latter on halos 11, 12, and 15 in extended form)
The glasses were in excellent condition, they were exactly what i expected plus more (they sent them in a glasses case which was a bonus to me.  This was an excellent seller
This movie combines two things I love in a film: ---  --- The actors are able to enjoy and showcase their talents. This is an --- improv lover's dream.  --- AND --- It makes fun of a topic which takes itself too seriously, in this --- case, dog shows. Only one character in the film keeps the importance of the dog's rating in context. ---  --- Mainly though, it is just hilarious. Some (okay-a lot) of the humor is too crude for my kids to see unfortunately, and nearly too crude for me. Still, it fits the genre.
I would call this the musical equivalent of the worst of abstract art.  There are those that "appreciate" unintelligable works for fear of being thought stupid if they don't . . . just as the emporer's subjects "Ooh"ed and "Ah"ed in admiration of his clothing as he paraded naked in front of them
Pull ups are NOT very good for potty training, they are for parents who are too lazy to take their kids to the bathroom.  Potty training does not include using diapers.  That is what these are is fancy diapers.  If you want to potty train your kids put them in real underwear or training pants with a plastic cover on them.  The wetness liner is a joke.  These also give kids the impression that if they do not want to go to the bathroom they can just go in their pants
I would have to agree with the problem of the dividers to separate the dates, it just doesn't work. I didn't send it back because it really goes with my desk and I do like the two small drawers. Maybe I can fit some nice flowers or a decorative tissue box or something in the top bin and place mail somewhere else. I wouldn't have put my name on this thing. Does anyone out there need extra plastic dividers for this thing? You can have mine.
The ToshibaMD14F52 arrived defective. Some channels would not function properly - ghost images and snow on screen. We have direct connect cable with 5 other TVs that work perfectly. Toshiba customer service was horrible to deal with; they were evasive,would not listen to my explanations but insisted on telling me to try what I had already tried to make the TV work. They also told me to call my cable company for help. Finally, after talking to several different unhelpful and unfriendly Toshiba people, I was referred to a TV repair agent for Toshiba that turned out to be unsavory, dishonest, given to lying and refusing to demonstrate he had fixed the TV as he claimed. He refused to plug it in to show it worked. Well, as I suspected, when I got home and tried the TV, he had left the TV as non-functional as it was when he received it, but insisted it was fixed. He told me to buy an external TV antenna and not use my cable TV! I will never buy another Toshiba TV again
I thought this salt tasted pretty good until it occurred to me I go to the bathroom everytime I take a swim
I'm a big Koontz fan and as is generally the case, I greatly enjoyed this story.  It was a little strange but that's to be expected from this author and genre.  That said, it starts off fairly quickly and flows well through most of the book.  It had the curious sense of near-division in that the book almost seemed to be separated into two distinct sections that were not, in my opionion, as well-connected as in many of Koontz's other books.  In addition, the ending seemed a little hasty.  Thus I gave it four rather than five stars.  That said, I would gladly recommend it to a friend as I would most any of this author's work
I saw this movie and was shocked at the contents, considering that it was aimed at children. It starts out with the gypsy Esmeralda doing a very provocative stripper style pole dance. While no stripping happened, there wasn't much other difference in the style of dance. Later in the movie, one of the men is obsessing over her in a manner I would never want my children to see. He sings a song about how she will burn in hell if he doesn't have her, and meanwhile a vision of her provocative dancing is playing out in the flames of a fire. Regardless of the rest of the movie, these two scenes make this highly innapropriate for children. Not to mention that the story is very untrue to the novel, which had a tragic ending rather than a happy ever after one.
First, I'd just like to correct the person who said that moleskines have "no actual historical legacy". The Moleskine company may not have been founded until 1992, but moleskine notebooks have been around since before that. The company is not saying that Hemingway, Picasso and Chatwin used their brand of notebooks, they are saying that those people used moleskines. ---  --- But the great thing about these notebooks is not that famous people used them, but that they are of great quality. I highly recommend them
These steaks dribble like a basketball and shoot like a dream. They should include a backboard, rim, and net with these. And some cheerleaders wouldn't hurt, either
Waste of money, the manual doesn't have proper instructions, and settings buttons also not working as per the manual, I don't know its fault with the manual or button settings, I struggled for a week and returned this item
  DIS GY IS DA KYING OF DA SOUTH!!!  ---  --- Give me a f***ing break. When are we going to stop seeing crappy rapper after even crappier rappers that are so full of themselves that they feel the need to plasture their faces all over every one of their crappy unintelligent so called albums!! Nothing descent to say at all, just a bunch of mindless [...]. I bet you they don't even like music, they just want to be a "celebrity"  and be rich for 3 years(till their broke). If they really did geniunly like music, it wouldn't sound that sh**y!!!! GET OVER YOURSELVES!!! 
I love dogs but if I had wanted to know the ins and outs of dog obedience training, including the different levels snd sub-levels, I would have bought a manual. I wanted a mystery with fully fleshed out characters and a plot that kept me guessing. I got neither. The characters were neither likeable nor substantive. Except for the cop next door, I have no idea what they even look like or what, if anything, they care about besides dogs. The plot was predictable and the action stuck in first gear. Maybe the series inmproves after this book. I'm not taking that chance
My little cockapoo loves Newman's Own dog treats, especially the peanut butter flavor. She'll usually eat anything, but I feel better about giving her treats that are healthy, organic, and made with high-quality ingredients that I could eat. No by-products here! Great price & highly recommended
These have been my favorite cookies for over 20 years now, both in New York & California.  I just love the shortbread and the fudgy center and have never found another cookie that even compares. --- Recently I moved to the Southeast, tho, and panicked when I couldn't find any Stella D'oro cookies anywhere! I'm so happy to find them here at Amazon, where I'm a regular shopper anyway; now I can add them to my order everytime I buy something!
My 4 year son is learning about the fragility of life the hard way with this tank. --- Two Goldfish, two flushes. If I take the struggling fish out of the tank and put it in a fish bowl it seems to come around, but they won't last 24 hours in this tank. I've followed the directions to a T, Adjusted the pH, tried lights on lights off, pump on pump off, even used bottled water, but the fish just do a slow fade when in the tank
Radio Shack wanted $39.95 for a similar item so at $9.95 this was a steal - swr is good and performance is as much as I need for Corvette runs although it hears well and gives a good transmit signal for the small size far beyond what I need.  I did have to put a metal plate on the Vette (discreetly) as it wouldn't stick to the fiberglass.  Good produc
This was a replacement clock for one that fell off the kitchen wall. I was very familiar with this clock since I had the original one for almost 3 years. I like the look of this clock and I like the choices you have for different displays. Overall this is a sweet clock. I did not however give this clock 5 stars because when you try and "program" this clock it won't do what you want it to do, not sure if it how the owners manual is written, or whether the manual is out of date with changes in how to adjust the features
Okay, first off, I'd like to say that this is my first AF SLR--I stepped up from my dinosaur of a camera, Canon AE-1 manual focus, and right now I am quite overwhelmed by all the features in this little thing.  I'm still in the learning stages of all this technology but let me tell you this, I am having fun!  It amazes me that Canon can offer quite an impressive camera for the price.   ---  --- I just received my first few rolls from the developer and the pictures came out amazing--so clear and the colors are very vibrant.  Just to let you know, I'm using the 28-105mm f/3.5-4.5 USM lens.  I took the suggestions of many and passed up on the "kit" lens and I'm sure glad I did so.  I would highly recommend the f/3.5-4.5 lens, but unfortunately for the rest of you, Amazon has discontinued it.  But you could order it from one of the many other photo shops (B&H, Adorama, etc).  ---  --- Do I have any regrets on this purchase?  Absolutely not!  I love this camera and even though I've owned it for less than a month, I'm actually thinking about stepping up to the EOS 3 and using this as a backpacking/hiking body.  Hmm...what to do, what to do?  Do I purchase another body or start a collection of L-series glass?  ...that is the question. ---  ---  --- 
I bought this shaver last September, and at that point I agreed with the other reviewers. It delivered a nick-free shave and was quick and painless to use. This past May, it stopped being able to re-charge and just died completely. I only used the recommended cleaning solution, changed it according to the instructions, and cleaned it after every use. I sent the shaver back to Remington, they were very nice and sent a new replacement shaver after a few weeks. It worked wonderfully, for about 2 months when the same problem occurred again! I'm sending it back again and hoping for a refund this time, it isn't worth my time and money to go to the post office every few months to return yet another defective shaver!
Judging from the picture, I thought this thing looked like a turban!  It actually has no wrapped fabric, but is a firmly fitting cap.  Hidden in the back is an elastic band that will adjust for larger heads, which is attached to the edges of an ugly looking triangular gap.  Aside from this, the coloring is too bold.  Old Glory will select random coloration for each customer, but my selection has over twice the color variety as the one in the picture!  I don't see how I can wear it without attracting stares
I have to admit that, at first listening, I found some aspects of Ms.Belle's interpretations of these pieces disorienting. However, as I listened to these covers repeatedly, I can now say that I understand better what the vocalist is after. Not that I always agree with her and with George Duke,the arranger/producer, but I agree with their choices and their totally new project and enjoy having had my horizons broadened.  --- Ms.Belle has immense talent, superb technique, and a clear idea of each piece, and she delivers the goods without faltering or compromise. I admire that a lot in a performer. Her choices ask us for a reaction and we are free to accept or reject what she has offered us. When I first heard these renditions, I was quite stand-offish, but over time I have come to appreciate them more and more - almost to the point of addiction - and am grateful to Regina and George for their strength of conviction as well as their superior musicianship.They do NOT want us to listen in a passive way, they are waiting for our reaction..and God, this is really so,so good....That's the true spirit in which an album should be recorded.  --- I'd encourage you to get this album because it is about strong, powerful and personal interpretations of some great jazz standards by Regina. You may love everything about it, or you may reject aspects of her interpretations. But in any case you will not remain indifferent; you will be enriched by hearing these pieces in a clear and beautifully personal way. That is an important aspect of why I love this imaginative, innovative quality music and why this recording is invaluable.  --- And it cannot be said enough that her backing band is incredible, giving this album the necessary push to take it over the edge. It is a success because it skilfully avoids being categorized. Regina has had the courage to break out of the traditional mould and make a successful cross-over, which some purists may not approve of...  --- Only time will tell....
I bought this toy for my four year old for Christmas thinking it would be the perfect toy for her since she loves Care Bears and she loves the game hide and seek. This toy was a big disappointment! She was so excited when she opened the package but when we tried to play with it, she got frustrated and lost intrest very quickly. The Care Bear "finder" does not give good clues to where the Care Bear is hiding and makes it very confusing for a child. It was saying "come find me" even when she was within a couple feet of it and she had to be right on top of it before it would tell her that she's "getting warmer." It doesn't let the child know that they are getting close to it until they can see it. My daughter gave up on it quickly because she would be wandering the house aimlessly without any clue as to it's where abouts. I do not recommend this toy to any one. I would have given it no stars, but she does like the bear itself. Do yourself a favor...buy a care bear (much cheaper), hide it somewhere, and you can truthfully tell your child when they are "getting warmer!
Having so much enjoyed the first two volumnes in this series, I was not prepared for this turgid list of self improvement. Yes Clive is well read, English and Italian, yes he does know the difference between a Donatello and a Michelangelo, but do we need to know every book he read in the two years, every painting he saw and how it moved him. The simple answer is no. Unfortunately it takes 250 pages to find out. --- The story of how a drunken extemely funny youth becomes a sober mildly funny old pseud
I admit that I tried to read this twice and failed both times.  I got to around page 20 or so.  I'll probably try again.  However, if you're an adult who has already read other philosophies I would suggest attempting to read it just so you'll know what Objectivism is about.  I wouldn't suggest it for teens that haven't had any prior readings, though.  Objectivism is about the self and about "reason", and it can be heady stuff for someone who has no real experience in anything else.  ---  --- The strange thing about the tone of the writing is that it comes across as venomous.  I assume that's in my head, but judge for yourself.  Her caricatures of "The Witch Doctor" (who controls others from a spiritual perspective) and "Attila" (who controls by brute force) are actually interesting.  Wrong, but interesting.  Since Objectivists rely on reason alone for their survival (or think they do, anyway), it's rather surprising the lack of logical thinking early in the book. ---  --- My suggestion is to attempt to read it without dismissing her out of hand (she's not wrong on everything), or swallowing it all without using your own critical thinking skills. Judging by previous reviews, it seems there were plenty of both kinds of readers. ---  --- If you buy into it, you can get a feeling of superiority over others in a kind of pseudo-intellectual way.  If you don't buy into it, however, you're evil (either the Witch Doctor or Attila) and probably just too stupid to "get it".   ---  --- Why I didn't finish it yet... --- I just couldn't get past her ignorance of history, frankly.   If you're writing a work of fiction, the historical innacuracies don't matter, but this isn't supposed to be fiction.  I like history and most people don't, so it probably won't bother most people.  --- Also, while she denounces religion, Ms. Rand has no problem hopping up to the pulpit herself.  Like all other religions and cults, the world is messed up basically because people don't think like she does. 
...in the beginnig of the 1930's, the Turks would have succeeded in making the whole world forget about the Armenian genocide that took place in 1915/16. ---   ---  Turkey did succeed in putting pressure on the US-government in 1933 though, when a movie was supposed to be made based on this book, so the then US-government again put pressure on MGM not to make this movie. A foreign government coerced censorship in the Unites States: Just imagine that! I hope the the making of the movie
Some of Patterson's conclusions were a bit of a reach. --- Some of his segways weren't all that smooth. --- But this book is just plain entertaining. It is chopped full of stories on rockstars making deals with the Devil,lingering around after death, and backed up with just enough innuendo-ish research for it to almost be believable. Well, some of it actually believable. Patterson scribes on about various rockstar-occult alliances (in particular the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin) and uses quotes from the musicians themselves. --- 
I won't claim to be a professional food taster ... I just know what I like and don't like.  I don't like "yellow" popcorn, I don't like microwave popcorn, I like the "white" popcorn cooked in a pan.  For my "popping style" the Baby White pops great w/o lots of hard kernels.  'nuf said
MARIA MONTEZ, JON HALL and SABU made some very entertaining Technicolor "sand and sandals" epics at Universal and this DVD restoration showcases them in brilliant Technicolor. ---  --- It's strictly Saturday afternoon matinee stuff, nothing to really ponder in the way of complex plots--just the usual good vs. evil with Hall coming to the rescue of beautiful princess Montez in her usual damsel in distress kind of role.  ---  --- Exquisitely photographed on desert sands, it's exotic fun fare for adults and children with lots of eye candy to keep things interesting. TURHAN BEY is effective in a brief role but it's Montez and Hall who keep the story moving along at a lively pace. Well worth viewing and nostalgic fun for fans of the Universal series starring this trio of stars
Summary:  --- I wasted a lot of time trying to make this work, and I eventually went back to other products.   ---  --- In theory, integrating virus checker, firewall, spyware, and data backup into a unified suite (like MS Office with Word, Excel, & PowerPoint) makes sense.  However, this software package seems poorly made; it did not work very well for me.   ---  --- Hardware, OS, & primary software used:  --- 1.  Dell Lattitude D620 Laptop with 2GB RAM, Windows XP, MS Office --- 2.  Dell X1 Laptop (thin/lightweight) with 2GB RAM, Windows XP, MS Office --- 3.  Dell Dimension Desktop with 4 GB RAM, Windows XP, children's games ---  --- Prior virus/spyware products:  --- Lattitude & X1: Norton --- Dimension: freeware provided by our ISP ---  --- Theory:  Since Microsoft makes the OS & office applications that get infected with viruses, their product should be better integrated with the OS.  There will be synergy by integrating several related software applications.   ---  --- Lesson:  --- Well, after a series of terrible experiences, I hope others will benefit from my wasted time:  ---  --- 1.  Instead of loading most of the program from the CD & downloading small updates, this seems to load only a small part of the program and downloads huge files.  This made me feel that the product was shipped unfinished.  You had to do this separately for each machine since it hides the downloaded files then deletes them prior to finishing the installation.  This took a better part of an afternoon.   ---  --- 2.  I purchased a 3-pack license.  Installing and activating the software on the 2nd & 3rd machines required a series of very annoying steps that involved logging into their website with broken links.  It finally required a phone call.  At least, the phone support experience was good.  ---  --- 3.  The product promises to minimize performance impact, and improve overall performance.  On the Lattitude & Dimension (powerful machines), there was no difference in performance, but we could notice a slightly slower performance with the X1.  This was later verified when we uninstalled the MS Windows OneCare and replaced it with another product.   ---  --- 4.  The product has difficulty updating.  It opens a small message box that asks you to click to update OneCare, but that takes you to a webpage that only works about 1 in 4 times.   ---  --- 5.  Except for the first time, data backup always has several errors that I have to manually fix.  This has very rarely happened with other data backup software I've used.   ---  --- 6.  Some applications, the firewall asks everytime for permission to connect to the Internet although the application is in the list to always allow this connection. 
I never write reviews, but I had to make my comments on these socks. I bought them to keep my feet warm at me desk at work.  I put them on and turned the switch to high.  They DO NOT EVEN GET WARM at all...I thought it was broken, but realized it was both socks that didn't get warm. These are a total rip off and I am going to try and send them back. 
I received my Valeo Ocelot training "glove", still waiting for the other.  Bubble pack had only one glove in it.  Amazon HELP has no concept of partial shipment
I received an email from txshirts stated that I should direct all inquiries to csr@txshirts.com. I did this on two occasions and received no reply. Customer service finally contacted me only to ask why I had left negative feedback on Amazon. They stated they never received any email from me. ---  --- Their gym shorts were not as described. The description said "covered elastic waistband". Instead, I received an "uncovered" elastic waistband that digs into my skin and leaves indentations on my skin.  ---  --- Their response? I should pay for return shipping in order to get my money back. ---  --- But who should pay for return shipping when an item is falsely advertised??
This shaver is ok but has an electronic problem. I get clean shave with little bit of effort but, My main problem is with ON/OFF button. Just after using this for 3-4 months my shaver ON/OFF button stopped working.  It is always in ON position I can't switch off the razor. The only way it switches off is when the battery runs out
I made the mistake of buying a two-year subscription.  Every upgrade slows the product down.  A scan that used to take 14 minutes now takes over one hour. Stay away from this junk--there are much better free products available
Read out my OBDII error code with a one-line description and allowed me to reset it.  No problem
Perhaps a age group should be posted as with most toy sellers.  I bought it for my 4 year old nephew and it's worthless to anyone other than I guess stores who like to stick star war stickers on the retail counters.  It is deceiving and the retailer is arrogant and would not even consider a return since it was opened to see what it was.  Avoid this retailer and it's products
My son picked out these shoes for basketball. He liked them at first and gave them time to get broke-in, but the outsides of the shoes had no give. Most shoe will form to your foot, these did not. At the end of third stripe, you could feel a big ridge on the inside of the shoe.We had to buy a different pair of shoes that formed to his foot better. Nice looking shoe, but not the greatest fit
These are the only semi-affordable bikini briefs I've found that are actually designed with a "pouch", making them the most comfortable on the market (of all the brands I've tried, that is). Unfortunately, they're difficult to locate in typical retail outlets, and you'll probably have to purchase them from an Amazon outlet that has exorbitant shipping charges, but what can I say. I guess it's worth it. ---  --- The briefs also run about a size small. I have a 31" waist but the mediums are too small.
The Miernik Dossier was shockingly good. Before this, I had never read anything by McCarry. In fact, I had never even heard the man's name. I was lucky to come across a review of this re-issued work in a magazine. Now I am collecting everything by him. ---  --- The story follows an odd assortment of people, some of whom may or may not be intelligence agents, as they travel south through Europe into Africa. For the entire length of the book you will be wondering and guessing and probably changing your mind many times as to who is working against whom and trying to figure out if Miernik is who he says he is. The writers of the dossier themselves seem to be unsure. In that sense the Miernik Dossier has similar elements to a mystery or detective novel, but yet it goes way beyond that. It is also a highly compelling character study, with each of the group drawn intricately by the author so that you come to know the characters. This makes it all the more suspenseful because these people who you seem to know or possibly identify with in some way may very well not be who you think they are. ---  --- The Miernik Dossier is a highly entertaining read. True spy literature, in the vein of Ashenden, that is enjoyable for those who enjoy spy stories, mysteries or simply great writing. I cannot wait to read this book again
Ahhhh, what a great movie.  I cry at the end every time.  I remember when I was young and prayed for the safe return of the astronauts of Apollo 13.  However, I am SEVERELY dissappointed with the widescreen DVD.  Those who created it did not use the original film, but chopped top and bottom from the fullscreen VHS version.  There are many instances when this is evident, but the most glaring is the scene in the back yard of the Lovell house after the walk on the moon when Jim says, "I want to go back there".  When the scene opens, he is cut off at mid-thigh and you never see below his knees. On the fullscreen VHS you can see his shoes.  When I buy the widescreen, I want the WHOLE movie, not less than the fullscreen VHS tape.  Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.  Buy the VHS
My first objective was to find an alarm clock with a programmable snooze -- this one's got it.  Second objective was to be large enough for day-to-day use but also useable for travelling -- this one does it. ---  --- The projection feature works great for me -- it's razor sharp and even at it's lowest setting very clear.  If you can't see it in the day time, look at he front of the clock (which can also be lit by LEDs by pushing any one button). ---  --- Yes, the buttons are not the sturdiest, but I believe that the need to use them often is negated by the fact it is radio-controlled.  You set the alarm and display preference once and you walk away. ---  --- For a $20.00 alarm clock, I think it's a fantastic value
This was a really dissapointing remake of the great adventure story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It didn't really seem to follow the original novel other than the names of the lead characters. The plot and scripting are  incredibly weak, it seems the editors just stopped mid-movie and rolled the  credits there. The CGI dinosaurs' appearances were impressive but their  animation was very stiff. In my opinion, not worth the $83 it costs
This cable is tooooooo cooooooool when you play multy-player on Final Fantas
This is the best bed rail if you DO NOT have a box spring. My 2 year old recently moved into his toddler bed and I purchased this rail because he has a "bunkie" board instead of a box spring. The length is satisfactory, and the fold-down mechanism is perfect because of the raised hinges. It is easy to make the bed as well. We also purchased it for the grandparent's house because they have a platform bed. It works equally as well. My only complaint is that maybe the rail isn't high enough but my son hasn't been tempted to climb over it. I would recommend this bed rail for a good transition to a "big boy" bed that doesn't have a box spring (although the manufacturer recommends it)
This is the first episode where we really see the heart of Tony in his dealings with a teenager struggling with the horrible death of his father. A must see
Wow, I just viewed "Spun" the other night and I thought this movie was outrageous. This is sort of a guilt-pleasure movie but you want to take shower afterwards. ---  ---  "Spun" has an impressive cast of recognized actors. The film is, essentially, about a few days in the lives of a group of drug addicts. There is The Cook (Mickey Rourke, he truly makes this story worth watching), who makes the drug (speed) and sells it to Spider Mike (John Leguizamo), a dealer with a junkie girlfriend, Cookie (Mena Suvari, looking infinitely less attractive than she did in "American Beauty"). One of his clients is Ross (Jason Schwartzman), who does a lot of favours for The Cook and his girlfriend, Nikki (Brittany Murphy).  ---  ---  I was surprised at how funny the film was at times. It doesn't drown us in anti-drug messages, nor does it become one of those, equally tedious, drug films where you feel like the sober driver at a drunken party. The humour is dark, certainly, but funny nevertheless. A lot of it comes from a subplot about Frisbee, Patrick Fugit,  who is caught by a couple of TV policemen (Peter Stormare and Alexis Arquette) and is told he will be let off if he helps them get Spider-Mike. I will only say of the resulting sequence that he does it with all the subtlety of an undercover policeman with his badge stuck to his forehead. ---  --- This is a film with a lot of energy, that seems, like its characters, not entirely sure where it is going, but determined to get there, and quickly. Although I am sure it is boring to be surrounded by people on speed when you are sober, this film almost makes you feel like you are on speed too. The director, Jonas ï¿½kerlund, has directed music videos in the past, and it shows in his impatient filming style, as he plays around with animation, speeded-up camerawork and such like. ---  --- I'm not recommending the film for its style though, although I am sure it is the best way this material could get to the screen. I am recommending it because I liked the main characters, which I think will stick in my head for much longer than the animated sex scenes or the split screens. I can imagine an entire film about The Cook and Nikki, or Spider Mike and Cookie, or even just Ross, who absentmindedly keeps leaving a girl handcuffed to his bed for hours/days. What makes "Spun" better than those hypothetical films is that it puts the characters into their own little community, and we feel as if we are watching their everyday, speeded up, sleepless lives. Simply amazing. --- 
I have my own business so I decided to give back to community by assisting with Christmas for the unfortunate.  I purchased 7 Amazing Allysen dolls and a plethora of other stuff for the less fortunate.  None of the Allysen dolls work.  I purchased a Amazing Allysen for my little in cousin in Florida also. We tried to make that doll work but it would not.  I went to the local Walmart to purchase another one and it did not work either.  I am totally disappointed with Amazing Allysen.  The kids that I purchased the doll for in Raleigh North Carolina could not find the appropriate things so that I could return the dolls.  I will return the one I purchased for my cousin today because my 30 days are almost up.  This was a horrible experience.  Those kids were expecting to have a super awesome doll, but she did not work.  I felt so bad because it was like I had something to do with it because I purchased so many and none of them worked.  I did have the opportunity to return the doll to Walmart in Florida and purchased an Amanda doll for my little cousin after Christmas.  She really loves Amanda
Suspenseful erotic thriller with Neve Campbell, Matt Dillon, Kevin Bacon and Denise Richards. Has the teacher Sam Lombardo raped his pupil Kelly Van Ryan? Or does the spoilt gal want revenge for being rejected? The movie with the many twists and turns. Brilliant story. The resolution only comes in the final credits
There is little more I can contribute to this literary masterpiece--even though the essential structure of my review is clear in my mind, it will not be able to truly capture the magnificent splendor of this work. Gustave Flaubert was a conscientious literary artist who revised and perfected Madame Bovary with care. He worked on the novel for nearly six years, during which time he rewrote the manuscript several times, often spending days perfecting a single paragraph. The result of his painstaking creativity was a masterpiece that rivals the heavens with its beauty. Madame Bovary is a penetrating psychological study of its heroine, Emma Bovary, as she struggles to find fulfillment through a realization of her romantic fantasies of love and wealth. She exists in a dream world and longs for freedom from her middle-class humdrum lifestyle. Flaubert's realistic portrait of the tragic fate of this complex woman is nothing short of phenomenal. ---  --- In perfect contrast to Emma, Flaubert introduces Charles Bovary, a proto-typical doctor who has no real talent or ambition and is content to enjoy the simple things that life has to offer. Soon after their wedding, Emma becomes disillusioned by the bumbling Charles and yearns for a romantic interlude. Flaubert represents the absolute clichï¿½ of provincial life with his portrayal of this undemanding, unimpressive, and unnoticed middle-class man. Flaubert brings all facets of human personas full-circle with the shy, well-mannered, and well-liked young man-next-door, Leon. With a slow-blossoming relationship with Emma, Leon leaves for Paris to study law. Upon his return--and with a little experience--the two become lovers. Flaubert's portrayal of this dysfunctional couple is reminiscent of tragic romances of yore. Thereafter, the degeneracy of Emma's lifestyle is evident, and she is brought to the brink of destruction. ---  --- In Madame Bovary, Gustave Flaubert gives us a vivid and life-like glance into the reality and the mannerisms and the customs of small-town people living in France during the mid-nineteenth-century. Flaubert's descriptions are detailed and beautiful--and paint a real portrait of the natural world he is describing. Opening with first-person narration that sometimes shifts to third-person has earned Gustave Flaubert the reputation as one of the most celebrated and influential novelists of the nineteenth century
I love the pod idea...makes cleaning so much easier. This is perfect for a quick shot of espresso after dinner. Excellent
People will no doubt find the Nintendo DS Lite to be a way for Nintendo to sucker people out of their money. It can be that way, if you think of yourself as a sucker, but for me the DS lite is a little better. Simply put, if you're content with your original DS, then don't even waste time to buy this one. If you don't have a DS period, the DS Lite is a much better investment than the original bulky one. ---  --- With the DS Lite, gameplay is made a little simplar. The button placement and brighter screen make the gameplay a little better. For one, the start and select buttons have been moved to resemble where they were on the original Gameboy Advance. This makes handling some of the functions (especially for GBA games) a lot easier. The buttons, sadly, are a still a little small for guys with big hands like myself. ---  --- The DS Lite also comes with a phony GBA cartridge (called a "cap"). If you don't have a GBA game plugged into the system, you can put in the phony cartridge to keep it from collecting dust in there. However, when you do stick in a GBA game, it sticks out by about a centimeter. It just looks weird. The cap does, at least, keep the system looking good. ---  --- Perhaps the most welcome change to the DS Lite is the screen. The original DS screen was not exactly bright. In fact, it was, in comparison the DS Lite, rather dark. Games like Metroid Prime Hunters were darker than they had to be. On this new screen, the difference in how bright the games appear really shows. Not only that but, you can adjust the brightness if need be. It doesn't really affect the battery life, either. You can play the DS Lite for as long as you played the original. And also like the original, it charges while you play. ---  --- Another welcome difference is the touch screen itself. These screens last a lot longer than the original DS. Those who have an original DS no doubt experienced a lot of scratches on their screen from their stylus. To the point where it was noticeable. You could still see the screen, but it was apparent that the stylus was doing a number on it. The screen is more protected here. The stylus doesn't scratch the screen quite as easily. In other words, the touch screen lasts a lot longer. ---  --- The DS Lite also looks better, and fits in your pocket better. It also performs all the tasks of a regular DS. For example, if you're playing a game and you suddenly have to go, just flip it closed and it sleeps. There's also a place to store the stylus, and the stylus is better too. It's a little bigger and thicker, so it's not quite as easy to lose. ---  --- Some problems with the original DS still plague the DS Lite however. You still can't play Gameboy Color or regular Gameboy games on the DS Lite. Also, you still can't configure the controls to play a GBA game much easier. In other words you can't configure "X" and "Y" when you play a GBA game. This probably won't bother you in the long run, however. Also, the touch screen still has its sensitivity. Touching the touch screen with your bare hands is more dangerous than the stylus scratching the screen. The oils from your fingers might damage the screen and therefore, it won't respond to the touch of even your stylus. ---  --- When the original DS launched, owners will note that there were not very many good games availible. About the only good game during its launch in 2004 was Super Mario 64 DS. Now there are plenty of games out there (and not all of them are ports), so if you do want a DS, this is a great time to get one, and the DS Lite is a better investment than the original one by far. ---  --- The DS may not play movies, or MP3 players, but to be honest, that almost defeats the purpose of a gaming system. Am I looking to buy a portable entertainment center? Of course not, I'm looking to find a system to play some of my games on, and the Nintendo DS delivers. Real gamers know it's about the games, not about the bells and whistles of a system. For the casual gamer, the Nintendo DS delivers, and the DS Lite is a fine improvement. ---  --- The Good --- +Vastly superior to the original DS --- +It fits in your pocket easier --- +The Screen is much brighter --- +Touch screen is more durable --- +The placement of the Start and Select buttons is easier --- +A better stylus --- +The battery life is unchanged ---  --- The Bad --- -Those with an original DS, who want a DS Lite will have to spend more money for yet another DS --- -Some of the cons of the original DS are still her
After reviewing some of the other devices to hold the iPod Mini in place while exercising, selected the Armband Carrier. It more than adequately fills the bill of what I was looking for. Occassionally, you might have to adjust the tension on the armband to keep it from slipping down your arm, but it holds the iPod firmly in place. It can cause some chaffing if you wear a sleeveless shirt if you walk or run with the device. If you sweat a great deal while you exercise, I would advise removing the iPod from the holder after you complete your routine. Would recommend it to anyone who asks
I bought this for my wife when her Sonicare died. She loves it. Great price. She didn't want the better one and is very happy with it. Her teeth look great and she likes the way they feel after brushing
Casino Player is the end-all magazine for the serious gambler (and the gambler who likes weekend fun with lots of comps!).  It is one of the pricier magazines, but the cost is well worth it, and it isn't over-run with advertising.   ---  --- The letters to the editor touch on basic gaming, slot, and comp questions, and I always glean useful information from the Q&A section.  The magazine content covers slot machines, video poker strategy and probability, table game strategy and expected pay-offs, investing in the gaming industry's publicly-held corporations, and reviews of properties, restaurants, and shows.  I always read it before heading to Vegas to learn what is new and happening on the Strip and in the area. ---  --- Casino Player provides balanced coverage of Vegas, Atlantic City, Indian properties, and riverboat casinos.  As a Southern CA native, I usually skim features outside Vegas, but the magazine should be commended for reaching out to gamblers in all parts of the country
Someone posted below that they don't receive all their issues.  I have never failed to receive an issue.  I suspect someone is making off with this person's copies. ---  --- This is an elegant magazine, worthy of Martha.  If they cover a topic, you will know all there is to know about that topic.  The recipes are little gems, and I like the pullout recipe cards so they can be easily saved. ---  --- It's a little oasis of calm in a frentic world. ---  --- I do miss Martha's column of reminiscences, and wish that was back in the magazine
jorge sanz (a looker) stars as a soldier deserting from the spanish army during the 1930s civil wars, taken into a family, who proceeds to fall in love with and seduce all four daughters, while forging a father/son relationship with the patriarch. touching and kinky and off beat, a worthy winner of the oscar as best foreign language film in 1992.
This is the greatest product.  They stick to every restaurant table I have ever secured them to, are lightweight, easy to pack and fun for my daughter to look at.  Every time I pull one out of the diaper bag she says "Elmo, Elmo, Elmo".  They keep the germs away from her and the clean up is so simple.  I wouldn't do without them, they are great
I've always liked Tevin Campbell, he had a beautiful voice and really did it on "Break it Down". I particularly like Break it Down, Shhh, Brown Eyed Girl among others.. Excellent CD overall. 
I love this nativity even though it I think it is pricey.  There are no other ones like it.  They are Fisher Price Little People so you know they will hold up forever!  There aren't any other plastic nativity sets out there. Get the set that plays the song when you place the angel on top of the stable. It is so worth the price when you know they will play with it every year. I even take this to church when I teach my 3and4yr old class about Jesus birth.  They LOVE it
I found this title messing around adding things to my wish list.  I only read the blurb on Amazon enough to see Haitian Creaole listed as one of the languages.  Today updating my wish list I took extra time to find out why this was rated so low since nearly every thing on my list is 4 stars or more!  How unfortunate to find out that others before me made the mistake I almost made buying this in hopes of it having Haitian Creole!  Very disappointing!!!!  The makers should be ashamed
The only outdoor BBQ thermometer that I could find with a lighted digital readout. Easy to see in the dim light outside at the BBQ. Reliable -accurate -and easy to use -at an affordable pric
This headset has a major flaw - the connections between the headset and phone are full of static.  The other parties don't hear it, but their voice is  constantly zapped by the static, and I'm asking them to repeat themselves. I've compared it with a couple other headsets I've got, and they don't have this problem in the same locations.  Actually, this headset has static problems ANYWHERE - office, car, out walking, you name it. ---  --- Do yourself a favor and avoid this one
This product come with a washer that keep causing the leak. It works fine for few weeks then the washer become worn out and it keep causing the leak. Now I just leave it in my garage and can't return it or use it. very bad investment
About three years ago, maybe four, I bought two Lexar CFII cards. One never worked, the other worked, but lost all data. I wrote to Lexar, that I had two bad cards, they sent me one new card of the same size. I gave that to my girlfriend & told her to only use it on pix she didn't care about losing. I still have my card, in a ziplock. None of the file removal programs will get the images off, & I've used all of them, & had their (file removal) tech help give up. ---  --- In this day & age of "just make the item" I am upset. But you take your chances. Do you want the only picture of your great grand-mother lost because you used a Lexar? I wouldn't, I use an actual sandisk card, myself. ---  --- If they ever (Lexar) made it right, I may have written a better review, but they haven't. So that tells me that they don't care. ---  --- How important are your pictures to you? ---  ---  --- Frederic
These teas (both the raspberry and the blueberry) are priced lower than in the grocery store ($3.49 per individual box), where they are usually a seasonal item. This is frustrating since my husband and I are hooked on them and probably brew and drink a full pitcher per day.  They are the best tasting cold ice teas and great for the antioxidant benefits.  This seller shipped them promptly and they were very well packed.  We will be a repeat buyer for sure.  A+!!!!!!!!!!!
Much longer lasting than the standard battery.  Fast shipping
The sugar was perfect, I ordered it to go on a cookie I make only at Christmas time.  The cookie is an almond flavored one that you make by chiliing the dough and then cutting off a small piece which you make into a ball and then roll by hand out so it is about 9 inches long.  You try to keept it a little thicker in the very middle so when you twist it, it has a tapered look.  You leave the top with a small opening so you can put a pretty ribbon thru it like it can be hung on the tree.  When they are cooked and still warm you put a thin coating on them of powdered sugar and almond flavoring and water and when they are still sticky, you sprinkle the sugar on.  They came out beautiful, I then put them in an old cookie tin and serve them up to company, they think I am soooooo talented and it is so easy
Rhymefest is an Ok rapper and the first two joints are bumping. Man, I thought I was in for a classic hip hop album , It was like the Lakers were --- ahead by 30 points then all of a sudden the other team caught up and eventually won the game because after that it was just wack track after wack track. I admire his thought provoking lyrics but if the beat ain't hittin I could care less what you're rapping about. Rhymefest used so many R&B singers I thought I was listening to some old New Edition or After 7 joints not that I don't like those singers but I don't want to hear that on no hip hop album. If you want to hear some real Chicago hip hop check out All Natural the best besides Common to ever come from the city of wind
I purchased this item because of the trustworthy name and cordless feature. The positive reviews here are from first impressions. However, I have had this clipper close to a year but with probably less then 5 hours use. When I first received it, it felt very light and cheaply made. I gave it the benifit of the doubt and hoped for the best. Last time it worked, the motor slowed down to almost a halt. I keep it cleaned and oiled. The motor is just too cheap. Im not sure what the company Wahl was thinking when they made this product. They should really consider discontinueing this model because it is hurting their image. I would not even attempt to use my warranty because it's not defected parts. It's a total LEMON. It would be nice if they will let me exchange it for a different model or full refund. I would even pay the difference. --- I do not recommend this product
Hello, ---      My name is Cloe. Yes, because I love Bratz so much I changed my name from Matisyahu to Cloe. I love this doll. IT BEATS BARBIE AND KEN BY A MILE. Speaking of Barbie I also reccommend the singer AQUA she sings " I'm a Barbie Girl." Buy Cloe and the others while you can!!! It's worth it and it will be a decision you will NEVER in your whole entire life, however long that may be, regret
I go to the movie theaters and they always have these gummy cherries. These are so good! I wouldn't dare share these! They are highly addictive and I can gobble them up in a minute
I bought the Faith Hill DVD to hear her sing but instead the songs were interrupted with talking.  I would rather have had the talking put to one side and be able to place the music uninterrrupted. Wish I could get my money back!!! So spend your money on another DVD
My daughter has trouble concentrating in school. I got this for her birthday and her grades instantly improved to the point where her teacher stated that there was a noticable improvement in all areas of her work. The best thing about it is that I don't have to tell her to use it because she loves it. I told her it's just like having a laptop because she always wanted a computer of her own. This is as close as I'm willing to get concenrning her having her own computer at her age, plus it's a minute fraction of the price of a personal laptop. ---  --- For children who don't have a hard time in school, this may not be for them but for my daughter it is a whole lot of what I needed to help me help her learn. I just wish I could find an adapter. 
The software is better than the previous Family Tree Deluxe version I bought.  It allows you to better classify potential matches and decide whether to look at them later or tag them if not interested. The merging process of two databases is easier and allows you to pick what info to merge or whether to keep some info as secondary
This is the standard style from the new line of Performance jocks from Bike. This waistband is slightly smaller than the traditional 3 inch, but very comfortable. The pouch fits nice and snug giving you perfect support and the leg straps don't twist or bind. Easy to launder and pretty inexpensive. I got rid of my old worn-out jocks and bought a few of these new ones. They're masculine, modern and comfortable, but not something that would be embarassing putting on or taking off at the gym (like an orange or blue jock). A good buy.  Comes in a black version, that is also great.  I've worn for working out, and just around town - good for both.
I received this subscription as a trial, and found it one of the most boring publications that I have ever read.  By the last few issues that I got, I wasn't even looking at the pictures anymore.  There are drawn-out descriptions of their views of the finer things in life, which were very materialistic.  At the end of every issue there were pictures of "real-life" wedding announcements.  Perhaps this is fitting for your local newspaper, but it struck me as out of place in a magazine
After hearing all the great reviews about this product I was very dissappointed when I first plugged in these phones. The bass was very flat and the phones were not very clear.  The other reviewers mentioned a break in period so I decided to leave the phones running on my CD jutebox for about 30 hours. WOW!, what a difference in sound.  It was like night and day with the sound quality.   The sound is truely amazing.  The bass was very good and the phones were very clear.  Grado needs to state this breakin period on the box or manual because some people may decide to return the phones not realizing there is a breakin period
I was surprised to find out that amazon sold groceries and at a much better price then could be found in a supermarket. A+ to Amazon
I use this gem on my 20D along with my 24-105mm, and as far as I'm concerned it is one of the best optical lenses out there. My 24-105 isn't the ideal indoor/low light lens nor is it the ideal sports photography lens( although it is sharp, just not quite long enough) The 70-200 fills in that gap in my arsenal with IS to boot! The photos I've taken so far on the sidelines are all keepers. If you can afford it, do it, you won't regret i
this was a christmas present and it continues to fall apart. the archways do not stay on them. too expensive for what you really get. i ended up putting most of it away except for the center cake piece and the cats. I would not buy it
just as advertised, very small, very useful, great video, great photos, just what I needed ---  --- this is the second JVC camera I own and both satisfy my needs
I have received so many compliments on this fragrance. I can always pick out the scent when someone else is wearing it. Although a fragrance will smell different on each person, I have not known of anyone this one did not work for. I guess the negative reviewer is the first I have heard of. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes a fresh fragrance
I got this phone in January, and I had to take it back the day I got it because it kept losing service and dropping calls.  They gave me a new one thinking that it was just that phone... but it wasn't.  The one I have now isn't as bad as the first one, but it still loses service and drops calls constantly.  Don't buy this phone
The scales/handles seem decidedly gray, rather than black.  Pen has nice length.  Battery hidden under plastic liner.  Even found a nice thin layer of oil of some tools!  :~))     At the outer limit re carrying in front pants pocket .... unless work jeans
I have always dated men who wear this cologne. Not on purpose but I always seem to find or smell men who wear this scent. My mother calls it sex in a bottle. The scent is light and pleasant but still smells like a man should smell
I think that they are great diapers. I have used other diapers in the past and I am now sitcking with Luvs!!!! I get more for my money and they work great.
This is a good 1st season set for the series of Criminal Intent.  I strongly recommend this if you are a fan
 I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE LIGHT OUTPUT.  I PURCHASED THEM TO LIGHT THE INSIDE OF MY CHILDS PLAYHOUSE.  THEY REALLY ILUMINATE THE INSIDE AS BRIGHT AS A STANDARD LIGHT BULB.  I PURCHASED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AN EARLIER TYPE LANTURN BY RAYOVAC AND WAS REALLY PLEASED WITH IT ALSO.
Only works properly if you are not moving AND in a zero-gravity environment
I love green tea pocky. it's flavour is indescribable! it's sweet, yet light. you can only eat a few though, before it's enough for ya.  ---  --- I'd suggest that everyone try these, they're that good. :D  ---  --- also, the strawberry pocky with little chunks on them are awesome too. ^_^ try them
Used this for a trip from NW of Chicago to Houghton, MI (in the U.P.) and it worked fairly well except through some hilly sections (lost signal a few times). This works best when you have two people (driver and navigator) as looking over at a laptop while driving isn't a good thing! Would have been even better with voice prompts but at the price I wouldn't expect it
I am the kind of person that gets leg cramps or easily gets tired legs after a short walk, yet I need to work and that means that I have to be standing long hours. So when I tried your leg massagers I was ecstatic to find out the relief it gave me after a 10 minute use. I now use it every chance I get, my children use it after their soccer games and love it as well. It is one of the best purchases I have made.  It was worth the investment
I purchased this camera case for my granddaughter for Christmas to go with the camera her parents had bought for her.  This is the first time I have ever been DISAPPOINTED with a product I purchased from Amazon.  It was, in my opinion, not worth the price I paid!  The picture looked much larger that it actually was.  I wil continue to purchase through Amazon but I will be much more careful and definitely return it if I'm not satisfied.  In this case I did not have time to find another camera case.  --- Thanks for giving me the opportunity of expressing my opinion. --- Linda Sutto
If you like strawberries you'll love Crunchies!  Only 98 calories per pouch - I snacked on one pouch all day and didn't finish it off!  Very convenient- resealable.  I have other varieties on order! 
Great concept: protective rubber skin that protects the BlackBerry unit from accidental drops and scratches.  The rubbery material tends to collect all sorts of dust and lint.  It's very hard to get it off (unless you wash it with water or use tape to peel it off).  The protective cover doesn't fit around the screen too well.  Mine tends to be stretched out a little more on the left side than on the right (even if I try and reposition the unit itself).  The plastic screen cover (that can be removed) was already scratched due to the way it is packaged.  All in all, I am pretty disappointed... mainly because I paid over $33 for it.  It's now sitting on my desk at work collecting dust
I love the feel and multiple spaces available the only problem/fear is that I have had things fall out of it when snapped and string tight.  I would give it a 5 star if there was a zipper option to keep items secured
it is the best product of it type on the market and i wish it were more available in stores.i don't know what you mean by give your review a titl
I have been using Frederic Fekkai's glossing cream for a few years now and love it so I thought I would try the luscious curls.  It was very thick, which may be a good thing since there is so little of it, but doesn't spread through hair very well.  It left my hair a little crunchy, and the crunchiness didn't go away for a few hours.  When it did dry, i felt that my curls just kind of hung there, without much body or shine.  I have used Loreal's Professional line prior to this and I will definitely go back to it.  It's cheaper, better quality, and twice the size of luscious curls.
For all of the supposed 'resistance' built into this machine, it enables you to do  many -more- repetitions than you'd be able to do  of simple bodyweight 'core' exercises,(crunches, leg lifts, situps, and a multitude of others). Why is that, and what is the effect? 1/ Why : The resistance is -less- than the resistance supplied by the weight of your own body being moved around without any equipment. The so-called 'resistance' actually -assists- you on the return motion, the exact opposite of exercise.2/The Effect: You must do an incredibly high number of repetitions do get any effect at all, and it won't be much even then. High rep work should be full-body cardio , not isolated ab work. Ab work should be the same as any other muscle-building work : After you can do 15 reps , the resistance should be raised: Exercising the abs, obliques, other core muscles  to strengthen and build them. If an exercise doesn't get difficult enough to make you stop after a minute or so, it simply isn't difficult enough to do you any good. There is no such thing as spot reducing exercise. Modern ads know better than to claim the lie of spot-reduction, but they still strongly imply it. Why do they get away with it? : Because people never stop looking for an easy way out. The re-sale value of these gizmos goes down to around 5 bucks as soon as you own it. Why? : Because the market is flooded with as-seen-on-tv, home-exercise junk that's collecting dust
For those of you who like the addition of briny olives and capers to your sauce, here is the answer.  What a great balance of flavors, and a quick and easy, yet delicious dinner alternative
This is one of the worst-written programming books I have seen yet.  I'm sorry I bought it.  It appears to be written by a man who knows quite a bit about finance, and dangerously little about C++ programming.  Duffy's review correctly describes the main flaws.   ---  --- I would add that (1) The book is not structured to build upon OO, GOF Patterns, or STL design principles; (2) The code does not follow even basic C++ coding conventions; (3) The images (screenshots) are agonizingly UNREADABLE; (4) The code listings are in ITALICS using a variable-pitch font [is COURIER font code listing so difficult to include in a $100 book???]; (5) No over-arching component object model is suggested ANYWHERE in the book. ---  --- Some of the efforts at brevity are just plain WRONG or even DANGEROUSLY WRONG to teach beginning programmers.  For example, Pg 19 Data Types section: ---  --- ---------------- --- int - holds integer numbers up to a little over 2 million, for example, "int I = 2000000;." --- long - same as int. --- ---------------- ---  --- WRONG, PROFESSOR!  This is not only a syntactically incorrect example, but a just plain wrong assertion.  If the reader does not know how to determine the (platform-specific) size of an "int" or "long", then the author has only served to confuse the matter further! ---  --- Furthermore, I consider it a "cheapskate" tactic to ask readers to pay for the code from this book in electronic form (particularly when the book's code listings are so sloppy).  That said, I would not use the code, even if it had been supplied for free ... but it *might* have been interesting to have something to play around with... ---  --- Have any of the reviewers actually USED any code from this book without substantial refactoring? ---  --- The only use I could see for this book is for intermediate-advanced fin-techs, who want to review a few general algorithms for selected derivative calculations (futures, forwards, etc) ... but just be prepared to squint and suffer through reading the code
One of the pairs of magnets that is supposed to keep the flap closed are oriented in such a way that the same polarity face each other. Genius! Not. The result - the flap would not close and leave a gap that just keep on repelling each other. grrr...   ---  --- One more thing, only the screen is protected by a clear plastic. The wheel is not
The elastic in these shoes makes them too uncomfortable to wear. Otherwise, the quality of the lace shoes is good. I'd wear them if the elastic didn't dig into my foot (I have small feet too!)
FUNCTION FOLLOWED FORM On this one!! You can't see anything in the outer window, especially in the sun light. So you can't see who's calling or what time it is without opening the phone. It hurts your ear when talking. The buttons are difficult to push. It's my third Motorola and the prompts are different than others...Motorola should maintain consistency to keep loyal customers. Too many prompts to reply to a text. Thought the functioning of this phone was totally sacrificed for it looking 'cool'. I returned it and got my money back
Great salt scrub and it really does get warm on contact and leaves skin baby sooofft
It can be almost impossible to turn at times.  Instead of moving one to the right, you have to go three to the left, or fiddle with it so it lines up properly.  You can still solve the cube but it gets annoying when it doesn't move the way you want it to. ---  --- I was hoping it'd be better cause it's really cool that it fits in your pocket.  It's just too hard to turn.  I ended up breaking the thing trying to get it to turn one way.  And I cant put it back together cause one of the pieces is missing.  I really like this product (I'm buying another one), I just wish it wasn't so stiff. ---  --- Maybe they made it stiff so it wouldn't turn in your pocket but if you know how to do it, you can finish a rubik's cube in 5 minutes, max, so I don't see the need to prevent it from turning.  Apparently they thought people would solve like half of it and finish it latter
I agonized over whether to buy this cheaper pump or go straight to one of the high-end ($250+) models. In an effort to save money I started with this one. But I quickly realized I'd made a mistake -- it took *forever* to even get one ounce of milk. I ended up getting the Medela Pump In Style and loved it. I just wish I'd gone straight to that one and saved my money on this one. ---  --- For those of you who are trying to decide between this or a more expensive model, here are my two cents: ---  --- TRY THIS ONE IF... --- - You have a very abundant milk supply --- - You only plan to pump one or twice a month --- - You wouldn't mind giving your baby formula if you had to be away from her for an extended period ---  --- INVEST THE MONEY IN A HIGHER-END MODEL IF... --- - You're going back to work --- - Your milk supply is medium to low --- - You plan to pump more than two or three times per month --- - You are opposed to giving your baby any formula, ever (with a higher quality pump you could build up reserve breastmilk to have in case of an emergency) ---  --- Also, it's worth noting that most of the more expensive models can be safely re-used by other people so could be sold to someone else when you're done (unlike this one)
I bought this for my baby who, at 6 months was barely 16 lbs. She didn't hit the 20lb mark until she was past 18 months old, so she was rear facing for a long time. She loved kicking this but the mirror never worked well, I could adjust it and within a day or two it was all over and I couldn't see my baby again. The water seemed to evaporate and now just over a year later has hardly any water in it. We can't find any leaks but there's little water. The little fish inside stuck together right away and we could never get them back apart. Sadly we just gave up on it by her first birthday. It never worked for us as a mirror to see her and the toy part, while it was fun to kick at, was just worthless. My sister in law wanted one for my niece but I am glad she saw how worthless mine was before wasting her money on this
This remington razor is actually too sharp if you ask me.  I used it for a period of several weeks and it caused my face to blister and it actually gave me more cuts than a 10 cent disposable razor. Ouch. However, the shave is very close - expect to use a lot of cooling lotion with this razor.  The design of the shaver mechanically is fine and appears to be fairly reliable - although its a touch hard to clean because the blades are super sharp underneath the foils. I have owned Norelco and Braun for more than 15 years and on the whole found them to be a more agreeable shave
These shoes are cute but not practical at all. I generally wear high heals 4 inches and even more but these are the most painful shoes I have ever tried on. I ordered these and the peep-toe sling back version. These are really narrow in the two, my foot feels so constricted in there, they totally cut off your circulation. And forget about even trying to walk in these. Very poorly constructed. The peepttoe slings however are great, fit true to size and are comfortable.
After researching several cameras in this price range, I bought the Rebel T2 last month. It has met my expectations and perhaps then some. After recently trying out a friends camera in the 150.-ish range, I partially regret spending what I did. It all comes down to what you need, want, and how many bells and whistles you like. For the money though, compared to the competitors, I still think I made a good purchase. After all, if I use it for ten years, which I most likely will, I will have surely got my moneys worth. Bottom line: no complaints with it
I was overall very happy with the performance of this tent for the price aournd $100.  It recently survived well while being used for over a week of backpacking in Denali National Park in Alaska.  The  weight is slightly more than typical backpacking tents, but the price and features make up for that.  It survived over 40 mph sustained winds one night with no damage.  The two doors and size are decent for 6 foot people without being too cozy.  The vestibules are very handy for storing your boots.  On colder nights it did get a fair amount of condensation on the inside of the tent though.  Overall a good purchase. 
Way too sweet for beef jerky. It was similar to drinking a soda
Loved the price but I never actually received the item.  It shipped to the wrong address and I never got it back :-
These earrings are the beautiful deep blue of genuine sapphires and the 1.0 carat size is just the right size (anything larger might tend to look "fake". ---  --- I've purchased from this merchant many, MANY times and always find myself typing in *Sabrina Silver* whenever I need or want a new and inexpensive piece of jewelry...they're the best and I've never been disappointed. 
We just got this bike for my 4 1/2 year old.  It is a very sturdy bike that is easy for him to ride.  He is 45 inches tall and has about 1.5 inches clearance over the center bar.  On the box it said this bike could be used for children much shorter, but I don't see how.  It is a little bit of a struggle for him to get on the seat but once he is on he has no problems riding it.  Overall, the bike is very nice with 2 types of braking, a back pedal and hand brake.  The styling looks very nice and it arrived with no damage.  I would have given it 5 stars but the directions for putting it together were awful.  The enclosed directions were for bikes and features that this bike did not have and I was flipping back and forth trying to find relevant directions.  Putting it together is somewhat intuitive, and I did figure it out, but better directions would have been much appreciated.  
  I didn't want to invest a lot of money in an exercise bike as I plan to use it while recovering from surgery.  This one seemed to be pretty well rated and the price was very reasonable.  It does the job, but only just.  I've had it for about 2 months and the monitoring device has stopped working reliably.  Sometimes it tracks speed/distance/calories/time and sometimes it just won't come on.  At first it worked great.  Also, the seat is not very stable and is a bit wobbly.  Not in danger of falling off or anything, but just not a secure connection to the base.  Overall, the bike works about as well as you would expect one for this price to work, but I did hope for better quality
.....that's the day that the first WIFFLE BALLS (invented a year earlier) went on sale in this baseball-crazy country.  Mr. David Mullany created the first Wiffle Ball in Fairfield, Connecticut after seeing his 12-year-old son struggling to throw a curveball.  Mr. Mullany (to whom we bow down and show obeisance) cut eight oblong slots into plastic orbs that were used to package cosmetics and the Wiffle Ball, an American institution, was born. ---  --- Oh, Wiffle Ball, Wiffle Ball, it nearly compels me to wax poetic.  I'm now 46 years old, but the love that I have for the game of Wiffle Ball will possess my heart long after my body has any capability to throw a breaking pitch!  My Brother and I were born to a beautiful, baseball-loving woman.  Shirley grew up following the Cincinnati Reds, and as a child, she acquired a nickname based on a long-forgotten Big League pitcher.  As an adult, she worked for the Los Angeles dOdGers and the Los Angeles Angels (that was before they became the California Angels, and then the Anaheim Angels, and then the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, and then the Chicago White Sox victims).  She instilled in her two boys and one daughter a love for America's pastime.  (In fact, my sister was the first girl we ever heard of to play on a boys Little League team.) ---  --- But when we weren't on a baseball diamond with 7 other guys, and when we couldn't scrounge up two other guys to play a game of "Over-The-Line" at the park, my Brother, Doug, and I were battling it out in a game of Wiffle Ball in the yard.  We had some outrageously competitive games in our "Glory Days."  We perfected the art of pitching a Wiffle Ball, and baffled many a batter who tried to hit us.  I remember 1990 and a young, athletic college student who, claiming to have played Wiffle Ball throughout his childhood, challenged this old geezer on the UCLA field behind the John Wooden Center.  Well, my screwball was only breaking about 10 feet that day, and after taking it for strike three about a dozen times, he just shook his head, and I concluded that whatever game he was playing as a child, it WASN'T what my Brother and I called, "WIFFLE BALL." ---  --- If you have never owned a Wiffle Ball, you've never really been alive, my dear friend!  Although they do tend to crack between the oblong cutouts after some time (especially if you hang too many curveballs for my Brother who swings with great authority), they will last for countless hours of baseballesque bliss and excellent exercise!  They can be used anywhere outdoors because the Wiffle Ball weighs only two-thirds of an ounce, and if Doug never knocked one through a window, neither will you! ---  --- And although the Wiffle Ball is light, it does not follow that it should be taken lightly.  After San Francisco Giant (man, do I hate the Giants!), Kevin Mitchell won the 1989 National League MVP award, he publicly stated that he had really learned to hit the curveball by playing a lot of Wiffle Ball the previous off-season.  One of the greatest hitters of all-time, San Diego Padre, Tony Gwynn used to hit Wiffle Balls off of a batting tee because he could tell from the spin where he had struck the ball.  Play with a Wiffle Ball and you're in Big League company! ---  --- The Wiffle Balls offered here are the regulation 9 inch variety.  (And SURPRISE!  They're still made in the U.S.A.  The day production moves to Communist China I'll jump.)  Twelve Wiffle Balls are currently going for $14.95, that's only $1.25 per ball.  Do you have any idea how much fun you can have with a Wiffle Ball?  Well, take my word for it, you'll get more than a dollar and twenty-five cents worth! ---  --- Now all you need to do is get the regulation, Old School, plastic yellow ("banana") bat.  Of course, if you really want to splurge you can purchase the newly invented aluminum Wiffle Ball bat.  Funny story : My dear ol' Ma bought an aluminum Wiffle Ball bat as a gift for my Brother on his birthday.  But she wasn't sure what size to get, so she called the company.  "How old is your son?" the representative asked.  When she said, "41", he laughed loud and said, "I think you'll want to go with the heaviest model." ---  --- One of the great disappointments in my life (SERIOUSLY!) is that they didn't think to organize Wiffle Ball competitions until Doug and I were in our 40's.  We scouted out the competition at the "Wiffle Ball World Series" here in Phoenix a few years ago. (Players fly in from all over the country!) We figured that even at our advanced age and with my arthritis, we could still give those young studs all they bargained for and more, if we polished our long-neglected technique over the next year.  Alas, it never happened, what with work, and life, and all the other crap that gets in the way of Wiffle Ball play. ---  --- But that doesn't mean YOU can't fly into Phoenix next year and win the title!  Get to it, man!  Get yourself a dozen Wiffle Balls, a "banana" bat and start practicing.  Hint : the ball breaks in the direction of the solid half.  Want to throw a drop?  Make sure the solid section is on the bottom at your release point.  Then get inventive; there are innumerable variations on that theme!  You can thank me for the hint when you see me.  You'll recognize me because I'm always the guy who picks up the suitcase that comes around on the airport luggage carrousel with a plastic yellow bat strapped across the top of it!     
I had two unworking disks (One a PS2 game and the other a PSX game) so I picked this up and both work fine now! The only thing is you'll have to run it through a couple times. If you run it through once you'll see little difference... But for the price and since it does work... eventually, I still give it a 5 out of 5.
I thought this item came with or you had a choice of color. It did not. It is silver with black trim. It is also not very portible, you have to play it while its sitting on a flat, level surface.
This potty is completely useless.  It is so small that my three years olds' knees are up by his shoulders when he sits on it.  It is unstable on those little plastic legs and it's opening is too small for their little bottoms and it hurts them to sit on it.  This potty only stands about four inches off the ground so unless your toddler is the size of a six month old this thing is useless
(Note to Brian: The WAP54G *can* be configured as a bridge. I have two of them in just such a configuration. Took me about 10 minutes to set them up.) ---  --- Major modes of operation are: ---  --- 1. Wireless Access Point (its default set-up) --- 2. Wireless Client (connect a wired ethernet device via cable to the WAP54G and you now have a wireless ethernet device) --- 3. Wireless Repeater (extend range of wireless coverage) --- 4. Wireless Bridge (connect two ethernet networks without running a cable between them -- acts as one end of a "virtual" cable; you need two to get the job done) ---  --- A pair of wireless bridges is just what I needed but hesitated to buy the WAP54G because of Brian's comment that this wouldn't work. Because of my newness to the wireless world it took a bit of investigation to come to the conclusion that Brian was wrong. I bought a pair and they do work. ---  --- I rate it 4 instead of 5 stars for a few reasons. ---  --- 1. I understand that higher-end, more expensive, equipment can be had with more range than this box. Gotta leave some room to rate more powerful equipment! --- 2. One must dig very deeply into the users guide (a PDF on the CD) to find the default IP address in order to configure this device. Luckily I had read elsewhere what that IP address is (192.168.1.245). Other manufacturers make this info readily available, even going so far as printing it on the device itself. This will be critical info to any Linux user. Also, the users guide says that the default userid for logging in is "admin". Well, it's not. The only allowed userid is an empty field. This had me going for a few minutes. --- 3. Something that 99% of the world won't care about -- I like to have more access to the firmware. For example other Linksys products allow one to telnet to the box and do low-level analysis of the box and the network it's attached to. I think there are third-party firmware loads that enable this
This ashtray is made solid. I like quick extinguishing feature and if you open the lid all the way, the LED at the bottom lits up. I wish the LED was attached on the lid though. Overall great ashtray
How can you go wrong with these two-tone hoops?  They are stylish and substantial, and perfect for both white and yellow gold lovers.  Highly recommended, for yourself or as a gift
This is the best price I found for my second Rechargeable battery for my Nikon Coolpix 5200. It's perfect, and so nice to have a second battery!!! It was shipped so fast, I received it within a few days
This Elmo table will suddenly go off in the middle of the night.  I had to ship the first one back to FP on my own dime to get a new one, that one was broken as well!  The cookie monster did not work on the first one and now the ABC part does not work.  this time they are paying for my return shipping but come on!  what a pain!  shoddy electrical work.  i have the same issues with the aquarium bouncer baby seat.  make sure you get this garbage on sale! 
Use care when you use it as it can be easy to break pins, but it works just like it should and it's easier and cheaper than going to a watch store
This is a teen movie with the endless teen theme of boy seeking to get the goodies from the girl. It is better than the average for this genre due to several factors. Mostly, it is because is well done. ---  --- The subject matter lends itself to course treatment but that is not what is presented here. Instead, the situations are depicted with as much dignity as possible from hormone driven teenagers and is is presented with comedy. ---  --- The time of the film is the 50s. Society was more innocent back then but boys still had the same thing on their minds that they always have and always will. In this case, the school geek has a bad case for the school beauty queen. He is aided in his quest by the cool loner from out of town who has his own heart set on "the nice girl". Meanwhile, the unpopular girl has a bad case herself for the geek.  ---  --- The geek achieves his goal and learns that the decorative aspects of women sometimes cover up the less desirable traits. The loner finds that the nice girl really is a nice girl and that love is something special. The unpopular girl undergoes a hormone miracle and becomes a prize catch. Everyone winds up happy except the town bully/rich boy. It is simplistic in its portrayal but no less appealing for that. ---  --- Kelly Preston plays the beauty queen and she really is the stuff of dreams until the wrapper comes off. Doug McKeon plays the geek who becomes a prize himself. Catherine Mary Stewart is the nice girl that I wish had lived next door to me and Jami Gertz is the metamorphosed hormone miracle. The cast is rounded out by Chris Nash. Each does a good job in the role. Teen angst comes to the fore and a worthwhile story actually results.  ---  --- It was fun and bittersweet in the memories it conjured.
I've had this printer for four years. I print approximately 25 documents each week. This is the first time that I have had to replace the cartridge. It's a great little printer and this cartridge lasts a good long time, too. Compared to ink jet printers that I have had, I get about 5 times as many prints from this laserjet -- and the price of the cartridges is about the same as the ink jets. ---  --- Great buy
This was a perfect fit for my 13" Macbook. Tried a couple cheaper ones, but was never satisfied, usually they were just a bad fit. This is by far the best, holds the computer in place and is light weight. It's true you get what you pay for. One complaint, the extra pocket in front could be larger
I bought this book and was sorely disappointed. Nothing specific. Just lots of references to self analyzation to see what you think you want to do. You could do this yourself without a book
This was the worst purchase of any type of computer hardware that I have ever made. It felt very light and flimsy, the definition of cheap plastic. Not just the construction but the performance was terrible. It would work perfectly for about a half hour and then go on a break and do NOTHING for about 10 minutes. This was very very frustrating. Maybe I was just unlucky and received a defective one, but I wouldn't take that chance again. ---  --- I wish I could give this device a worse rating, somewhere around -4 would be much more appropriate.
:: Davinci Multicolor Tortellini :: ---  --- Delicious tortellini from Italy. Great experience, like being delivered from a good italian restaurant! This product has great taste, texture, and appearance. ---  --- My only disappointment was just upon arrival, first opening the case. The boxes seemed so little. I mean, compared to the 12 oz packages of pasta I'm adjusted to buying. It says 7oz right on the web page description, very clear, but somehow that hadn't really registered in my noggin. However, things got better. I soon found out that 7 oz of tortellini cooks up pretty big, more servings than I'd have anticipated from the little boxes. ---  --- Very happy with the Davinci pastas I've tried so far. I'd be complete if only they also made some pasta sauces for AMZN to send to my doorstep along with the pasta. ---  --- Anyway, I recommend this tortellini. It's great hot...and come spring, will also give it a whirl for cold pasta salad.  ---  --- 
We all know that Tamilee has that body.  Didn't expect her to be the only body in the video.  I am more for a group atmosphere.  So in that regard, I pass on this video.  Maybe next time Tami...
I use these onions for just about everything.  They are pretty mild and really add a nice, light flavor to your cooking.  This is about what I pay for three pounds so keep that in mind too when you order.  But, then again, it is online shopping for groceries so I guess it has to be pricey.  I use these on a daily basis and never seem to have onion breath!  Great, great stuff and I highly recommend them
Like the Backstreet Boys (essentially the same band), and Brittany Spears (their female solo artist - and I use the term loosely- equivalent), NSYNC represented all that went wrong with the music world in the '90's. Sure, there have been completely commercial bands out there for ages, but at least groups like The Eagles wrote their own material and played their own instruments. Not NSYNC, who instead rely on unimaginably boring backing tracks and a stable of professional songwriters who couldn't write a decent tune to save their lives - I bet even their voices were digitally altered.  --- And then there were the inescapable hits - Bye Bye Bye, Pop, It's Gonna Be Me, Tearin' Up My Heart, et al., that weren't even good the FIRST time around, to say nothing of the nine trillionth. No risks taken. No attempts to step out of their winning formula that somehow made this group of no-talents famous. Basically, this band was thrown together by a bunch of record company chumps who saw five or six guys who wanted to be famous (and probably had never previously met), sent them through the assembly line, removed any sense of individuallity or creativity they might've had, and dumped them upon the masses, who they must've brainwashed or something. I didn't even like this group when I was 10, to say nothing of now. Makes you wish Zappa was still alive - he'd have a field day with a group like this, and undoubtedly dish out some of the funniest insults ever in the process.
I was having problems with my second i730 transmitting and receiving, so I decided to upgrade my phones.  (the first 730's speaker grill came off, and i tried to glue it back on myself.  A word to the wise, don't use too much glue.)  So, I went to Nextel to get my new i760 after researching it on the internet.  I didn't need a camera phone, since I have a digital camera that takes awesome pictures.  One bad thing is that since I changed my phone back in April, I couldn't sign back up for two years and get the $150.  I could only sign up for a year, and I had to pay $275.  I don't understand that.   --- But this review is about the phone: --- Cons:  --- super short battery life, especially if you have the web. --- instead of having a separate button for each number key, it has three big keys, with little squares to make it look like there are separate keys. unfortunately, you have to be careful and hit the button fairly close to center, otherwise you'll dial the number above or beneath it.   --- the jury is still out on this one, but i'll list it under cons.  the casing looks like it might break easy since it is mainly plastic, whereas the 730 at least looked like some sort of metal. ---  --- pros: --- huge display --- a whole lot lighter than the 730 --- i enjoy the photo caller id.  it also shows the photo when you call that person --- the sleep mode is a good addition.  if you don't use the phone for a couple of minutes, the phone will power down a little like your screen saver so all you have to do is push a button to wake it up. ---  --- The only thing I really miss from the 730 is the multitude of the lights around the motorola emblem on the front, especially since there were several colors.  This phone just blinks a lot to your ring tone in a light blue.  OH well.  I'll write more the more i explore the phone. 
I think simply put, if you like Bob Dylan and just want to have fun with a movie, then you'll love it. The performances Bob gives are excellent, and it's great to see the ensemble of actors they lined up all together. ---  --- If your not much of a Dylan fan, and like your movies high and mighty, better just pass it up..
This is an HBO remake of the original 50's 50 footer. Naturally there had to be some adjustments for the new era. However it still captures the thrills and chills. You may also marvel at the spandex clothing that stretches for ever (rats.) ---  --- Nancy (the little woman) does not have quite the devoted husband. Here life is not quite ideal. Soon a chance encounter with aliens (the space type) leaves her feeling bigger about the situation. 50 foot bigger. Now it is Nancy's turn for a little revenge. The ending is a little unnerving. ---  --- Be sure to see Daryl in just as serious of a role in "High spirits" (1998) --- 
I just received this phone free as part of Verizon Wireless's "New Every Two" program.  My main gripe with the phone is that, unlike my former phone (Motorola V265), it cannot be set to display the time in the 24-hour format (I do not use am/pm).  Otherwise, the screen is nice and bright, it's easy to use, it's much less bulky than my former phone, and the voice activation is easier
I received "The Piano" promptly, and in pristine, excellent condition.
I've been a faithful subscriber to "America's Civil War" since 1993, and I'd say that it's easily one of the best history-related magazines in existence. I read each issue cover-to-cover, even the letters to the editor. Long after I first started studying the Civil War almost 15 years ago, I'm still learning a lot from this and other magazines like "Civil War Times Illustrated" (which is also great). In each issue of "America's Civil War" you can find a variety of articles in the following categories: personality (which focuses on a specific soldier of officer), eyewitness to war (great first-hand accounts from both soldiers and civilians), men and materiel (weapons and equipment), reviews, commands (focuses on individual units), preservation (of artifacts and historic sites), and of course several articles which can cover a wide range of topics, from battles and leaders to politics and slavery. Although I wish more would be written about the neglected Western Theater, I feel that the articles cover most aspects of the war very well. I love the artwork and outstanding maps that accompany the articles. And, "America's Civil War" is all about pleasing the readers. Back in 1997 I mailed in a questionnaire from "America's Civil War" after writing that my favorite issue had a great article on the famous Irish Brigade. A few months later a new article on the Irish Brigade (by the very same author) appeared in their magazine and I was very impressed by this. Bottom line: if you are a Civil War buff this magazine is just what you need
I have owned several pairs of this very boot since 1990; and the first two pairs lasted many years through winter, spring and fall. Each boot used top quality leather and Vibram soles. I actually had the soles replaced on the second pair as they became worn out before the leather upper portion of the boot. Both pairs were very comfortable and durable, with a look all to their own. ---  --- My third pair, which was recently purchased, were not of the same quality of the prior pairs of boots. The leather was stiff and upon wearing them the first time the top lacing hook pulled out as I began to snug up the laces. The backer on the riveted lacing hook was defective from the factory.  ---  --- Not being satisfied with the quality of the new boots, I sent them back. I did notice the country of manufacture was different on the later pair than the previous pairs. Made in Portugal to made in China... the quality has been degridated and am disappointed in Rockport.
For the price I paid I expected much more accuracy.  The data it downloads from its external monitor to the PC is terrible.   Even though the unit is synchronized with the atomic clock it still seems to get the dates wrong on the data it stores in its database.  It also has a problem with the accumulated rainfall.  The amount of rainfall according to the database is much higher that what the display shows for the accumulated amount.  The hourly and 24 hour period also tend to behave eratically. You might see an inch of rain in the last hour but when you come back later, the last 24 hours shows only .2 inches of rain.  Strange.  How can you have more rain in the last hour than in the last 24?  Seems backwards. ---  --- On the good side, the unit is easy to set up and connects to your PC with existing ports and a cable that is provided.  On the bad side, besides being inaccurate, the analysis software is primitive and difficult to work with.  You are better off downloading a text file and doing analysis in Excel.    ---  --- This unit also gives eratic readings with the temperature swinging up and down up to six degrees within a twenty minute window.  I wanted my son to see how the temps over a 24 hour period form a bell shaped curve.  So much for that.  This is probably OK for a first time weather station for my 8 year old but I would not recommend it for any one else since this unit is not cheap.   ---  --- One other thing, it only takes a reading every 1-3 minutes so wind speed readings are hit and miss.  You could be getting gusts much higher than what this unit happens to read.  I am dissapointed and annoyed that I spent the money and it is not at least semi-accurate.  I will tell you that I have it set up wireless.  If you use the enclosed hard wire connection option then you will get more frequent readings and maybe even better accuracy.  Good luck and do your homework first. 
This is the most deliciuos chocolate! It can be a bit messy, but it's well worth it! If you love chocolate, you'll love Flakes
My 4 year old son loves all things Rescue Hero!  His grandparents got the MACC for him almost a year ago now.  I run an in home day care,so I watch not only my son but 2 other 5 year old boys and my youngest son, 13 mo and a 10 mo old boy!  They all love it!  This thing has stood up to all of their adventures! One of the kids I watch was thrilled when he got the same MACC for his birthday from his parents!  He had just went on and on about it, and they couldn't resist.  It is very large, but we already had the firetruck, police car, helecoptor and about 30 rescue heroes, so,in the words of my son, we just HAD to get this too!  I highly recommend this toy for all ages!  Great imaginary play
Do not buy anything from this company unless you will be able to return it within 20-30 days of the shipping date.  (The receipt says 20 days but the web site says 30 days.) You don't have much time to return an item, and the company does not give any leeway for Christmas orders.  I am stuck with the item my son did not want for his dorm room, and I can't exchange it for another item because he didn't like any of their products. 
Dr Smith and the Robot go hog wild, switching personalities and swapping insults.  This is a great episode
My daughter ordered this to go with The Crib Shield System. It's a nice addition to the System and looks very nice
Outstanding comparitive review of new vehicles for 2006. Combined with Consumers report evaluations, no reason to go into dealership with many questions. December 2005 issue a "must have for serious lookers" contemplating purchase
OK, I know I'm going to get hammered for this; once again, there goes my reviewer rating. But I just HAVE to be honest: this is a terrible story. OK, being that it's Shakespeare, it's prettily told, but it's still a HORRIBLE story, and I can't imagine why otherwise sensible people like it. Perhaps they feel that Shakespeare is telling it tongue-in-cheek (it IS a comedy, after all) and poking fun at the system of fathers marrying off their daughters without any concern for whether they want it or not; that would almost make it tolerable, if I could believe it. But given that it IS a Shakespearean comedy, we must assume that the ending is supposed to be a "happy" one, and the situation at the end is far from pleasant. Or perhaps people believe (I've heard this claimed in all seriousness) that Kate has actually "triumphed" at the end, having figured out how to manipulate Petruchio so as to get her way subtly and underhandedly. Even if this were true, I'd hardly consider it a "happy" anding, and personally, I see little evidence of it. ---  --- No, what we actually have here is a story of a strong woman (some people seem to like it simply because there IS a strong woman to be found in it) being married against her will to a scheming golddigger who "Tames" her by blatent if indirect spousal abuse (he doesn't beat her, simply starves her and sleep-deprives her, as well as forcing her to wear muddy rags until she behaves exactly as he wants, up to and including winning him a bet by lecturing her contemporaries on their duties as obedient wives. Her spirit may or may not be broken, depending on how the part is played, but the fact remains that she's forced to BEHAVE as if it is, and that's not a message that should be bruited about in a "comedy". This is absolutely the WORST of Shakespeare's plays
The aspirator has no suction power and only irritated my son.  The nail clippers are not sharp enough to cut a newborns soft nails.  I use my own Revlon clipper especially since I am comfortable with the feel of it already.  The thermometer is sooo... slow, I get make an educated guess faster.  The case is cute and I am sure the medicine droppers are ok...haven't needed those yet.  But all in all, I threw half of this kit in the garbage
I did buy this grill in a store and now that I search Amazon for acessories I find that it is a lot cheaper here. It is a good grill the way it works but the quality is lacking. Many parts are not as sturdy, corrosion resistant or easy enough to clean as I would expect.
Fits great My Wife likes the bright color as it is easier for her to find in her purse and protects her phone
I liked SSX series, sequel 3 being the best, but I didn't play racers . I bought first NFSU and disliked choppy animation. I got part two just out of curiosity and I liked it so much I beat the game. ---  --- Basically , you are newbie in Bayview City and you race different type of races and build rep and your car. You must tune your car for each type of race and you must check shops frequently . There are various shops, from visual effect and paint shops to ones which improve your car speed, handling etc.  ---  --- Races are also different: you have races on isolated tracks, races in live trafic, Street X races in confined and cramped space without nitro option, with lot dirty driving and hitting; short tracks in which you win if you shift the gear in time, and my favorites, drift races, in which you win if you get most points, not if you pass the line first. Drift races are won by breaking and steering in order to make long trail.  ---  --- I used automatic shifting and I set game difficulty to easy since I don't play racers. I was about 93 percent and I got into race which was unmarked on map. It was 6 circuit race against boss and that was final one. ---  --- SOME ADVICE FOR BEGINNGERS: --- If you can't find races on map, go to garage and check out world map option and you'll get list of all races per level. If you beat them and can't find any more races, upgrade your car or get some stars on visual rating by getting 'cosmetics' (new parts like spoilers, lights, new paint) and you'll get an offer for magazine cover or DVD. If you are still stuck, cruise the town to find unmarked races
what i mean here is about 3 and a half stars which in my little scheme of things means the good pretty clearly outweighs the bad and i recommend it with a bit of enthusiasm. 4 star games are very rare for me and this game made a good run at it. i can't even imagine a 5 star game. i've come to think there are too many inherent problems in games for 5 stars. ---  --- anyway, ahem, this is about gun. a very nice game i looked forward to a lot. i played it just after it came out and hopefully havent forgotten too much about it. ---  --- the positives: ---  --- graphics! this seems to be a bit controversial as some people complain about them, but frankly i sometimes think people overrate realism and detail. gun's detail was not like, i dont know, half life 2 or something. i didn't repeatedly go "wow, unbelievable todays technology!" but i really enjoyed them. they were pretty to look at, they set the scene well and they were extremely refreshing- bright, colorful, open western vistas instead of dark, gloomy, tense, industrial, claustrophobic and filled with horror creatures and commandos like, i don't know, 95% of all shooters. it was lovely to ride my horse around spotting buffalo and hot springs and such. i appreciated that quite a bit. ---  --- difficulty: well, i can't remember if this game had difficulty levels. but i like difficulty levels and make a bee line for the easy choice! i do not like dying! even if i can reload right away, and i am not too great at these games. well, so, up until the last part of the game (more about that later) i had no real problems and generally felt clever and talented but not coddled and unchallenged. the poker was too easy though and i could not get the hunting and gave up on it part way through (i thoroughly completed everything else). ---  --- characters/voice acting: pretty good characters helped by superb voice acting. i don't want any spoilers here so i'll just say the quality of the characters was let down by the storyline, but i still liked them. and they looked pretty good to me. ---  --- gameplay: it was quite fun and varied. it had some of the best bullet time ever (called quickdraw or something). i loved how you could flick target to target with a single button which not only made me feel more impressive but also raised the speed of mowing down enemies in a way that made it less ridiculous that i was beating 11 people in a gunfight. the horse riding was done very well and it was nice to pony express. i liked that poker was in it though found it a bit limited, and both the ranching and mining were really nice and helped fill out the world and the variety of things you do. ---  --- length: i may be an exception, but the vast majority of games go too long for me. the feel of them and the things i do in them become redundant and i don't finish, so i like that gun seemed manageable. for the most part i was pleasantly full when i finished though perhaps finishing things was a little too cut and dried, like the way you can get every upgrade possible. ---  --- the negative: ---  --- story: it should have gone a bit lighter, i mean, it seemed to think it was some powerful clint eastwood directed western but unfortunatly computer games are not capable of pulling off anything nearly that sophisticated. they just have too much on their plate vis a vis gameplay and choice. the cutscenes and acting were nice, and it started solidly, but storywise it progressively deteriorated, or i guess was completely unable to fufill its set up. it gets a little hard to discuss without spoilers but, well, more romance would have been nice and the boss battle that goes on and on was not just difficult for me (remember how i hate that!), but it was irritatingly stupid, and senseless to the reality of the game. ---  --- conclusion: wow, only one big negative, but the huge, long, ending boss battle really bugged me. really, good game though. oh, and by the way, i have a pretty midlevel computer (and fading fast) and didn't have any real technical problems, maybe a couple of ugly frame slowdowns, but mostly it was smooth. that's just, you know, for what that's worth.  ---  --- anyway, if some of what i am talking about makes sense to you go try this game out
We registered for two of these mobiles for our twins.  We recieved both of them.  Upon putting them together, we realized that the mobile can't operate without the pieces hitting the bar that holds it to the crib!  How annoying!  We returned them both
The armoire is very pretty but please show pictures of the inside of the furniture pieces because I was expecting something else. I still like it very much but I wanted a part to hang clothes and it doesn't have one. It is very pretty and from the outside it was everything I was expecting!!! ---  --- Thank you
Purchased this phone as an upgrade from the i530, which I loved. I was at the end of a 2 year contract, and felt that I would get something with a few more bells and whistles - and was excited about the color screen with the icons.  Two of my family members have higher end Nextels and all work well. I would have purchased one of those, except I didn't really care about a camera for my phone, and this one was reasonably priced...and I found out you get what you pay for!  The i560 felt almost cheap in construction compared to the i750, i870 and even my old i530.  I had it for a couple of weeks when I started having trouble with the clarity of my calls - I could hear them, but they couldn't hear me.   ---  --- A couple of times, I had the screen go to Airplane Mode, even when I hadn't touched it.  The fact that you had to take the whole phone out to see who is calling was another downside, too.  My previous phone had to be flipped open to see who was calling, but I had a holster that could hold the phone without disengaging it.  Not a great design for this holster. Another problem is with the power supply. When charging the phone, it is especially important to make sure the plug is seated tight - and to check that is says device attached - it comes out easy and stops charging even when it appears to be plugged into the phone correctly.  ---  --- Then I am on a phone call on speakerphone and the whole speaker just stops working.  Living in California apparently gives us an advantage - 30 day risk free guarantee.  Fortunately, we were on day 12, and after 54 minutes, one accidental disconnection by Nextel and 6 customer service agents, I finally received a return authorization and placed a new order.   ---  --- Terrible, terrible phone.  Stay away from it.  Hoping the new one on it's way works much better! ---  --- Michell
When this jumpdrive was plugged into my Windows 2000 system, the software that it loads corrupted the boot sector of my hard drive. The Lexar "technical support" was no help at all. They told me to reinstall my system. ---  --- Luckily the computer repair person I hired was able to recover my data files before the OS was reinstalled. Lexar would not cover one dime of my repair cost. ---  --- I will never purchase one of their product again
There is a reason there are 247 used ones of this book. ---  --- We used this book in for our men's study group and every one of the men, and every one of the wives agreed, that this was a worthless book.  It was written for a 1950's wife that no longer exists. ---  --- Now 3 truly wonderful books to help you with your wife are: ---  --- Discovering the Mind of a Woman by Ken Nair ---  --- If Only He Knew by Gary Smalley ---  --- Together Forever: How to Overcome Problems and Rekindle the Love in Your Marriage --- by Anne Kristin Carroll  ---  --- They are truly inspirational as to how to be a good husband
First I would like to state that sooner or later every computer --- user will come in contact with some problem with an Internet --- Security program. They are human made and not 100% fault proof. ---  --- I study and work in the IT field and was first introduced to --- PC-cillin through Trend Micro's product Housecall. Soon after I --- tried out the trial and have finally bought the product. I LOVE --- IT! ---  --- I have used several of the other "major" anti-virus suites --- available and have had tons of problems with them. McAfee after --- one uninstall had bedded itself so far into the computer that I --- had to completely reformat the PC to gain functionality again. --- Norton to say wasn't much better. ---  --- If you are installing on a "clean" PC where these other software --- suites have not been, I have not had a problem. I have --- installed/uninstalled PC-cillin many times each time running --- smoothly. ---  --- The software has been a valuable asset protecting my PCs by --- alerting me to virus threats and even hacking threats that were --- not even on my network but on my ISPs network. As well as --- protecting my network from one single computer that received a --- virus by shutting off traffic to that PC.  ---  --- I can understand where some of the other problems reported with --- this software may occur if the person a beginning user or just --- unfamiliar with the framework of the software. But if you already --- have some experience in how to set this type of software up I --- really do recommend you give PC-cillin a try.  ---  --- It is a sleak program, easy to install, easy to customize, and --- really goes above and beyond with alerting you to possible risks --- and threats.  ---  --- With all its competitors out there I would choose PC-cillin over --- the rest any day of the week
My six month old grandson loves these toys!  They are perfect for the teether and he loves the colors and noise.  They hold his attention for much longer than some of his other toys.  They are easy for him to hold and shake.  I would buy them again in a minute.
I bought three of these at once - and they all were fine for being an adapter to a 3.5mm headset for listening to music, but they didn't handle calls at all - everything is full of static, listening and talking. I just placed a call with it, and the person who answered immediately told me to call back that the connection was terrible, but it was the adapter that was the problem, full of static and echo. I would never use these for calls
Nice replacement for my Oprah Magazine. --- Like the concise and to the point articles.  Good suggestions sprinkled in magazine.  Very heavy with the advertisements...but then the ads rip out quickly, leaving a more simple Real Simple read.
I bought the Avent Breastshells because of my sore nipples, and a way to collect leaking milk while I was not nursing, and relieve some engorment. ---  --- 1. It is very messy when removing the colleting cap --- 2. My nipples are still sore --- 3. And the only way to relieve engorment pain is to nurse or to pump ---  --- If I would have known about these factors I would not have purchased this product
The thule 450 foot pack is quick and easy to install, fast delivery, On a scale from 1 to 10,this whole transaction is a 10+++++.
Extremely pleased!  We received the entire Strathwood Bainbridge Collection within 2 weeks and the packing job alone seems to be worth the cost of the product(s)!!  The patio furniture is both beautiful and solid. Hope it will last for many years.  
Size was true. I just did not like the
Inspiring? No! Pleasant? No! Entertaining? No! Worthwhile? No! ---  --- What are you folks sniffing out there anyway? Whatever it is, please consider passing it along, because other than the single authentic and melodic track by Patsy Cline (i.e., Back In Baby's Arms, which is available on a zillion other collections including some of her own), this CD doesn't have an ounce of redeeming musical, lyrical or social value in my view. Nada! Zip! ---  --- Even the Dylan track is junk! The entire CD is essentially drivel, put to the dull, homicide-provoking sound of endless, droning noise, with an overall signal-to-noise ratio of about one (1.0)!!! What a WASTE of an A-to-D converter
I originally bought another Motorola charger from a Verizon dealer which was twice the price of this one. I returned the other one because this one worked just as good if not better! It actually fully charges my phone in less time and I can swear my battery life lasts even longer. It's a great product for a great price! Delivery was quick too.
I recently returned from almost 3 weeks of treking around Italy. I'm not a runner (or a walker, or even mildly aerobic) and I have baby-tender feet, so I was very concerned about blistering. On the advice of some runner-friends, I bought BodyGlide and coated my feet with it EVERY DAY before I put on my socks and shoes. My feet were tired and achy every night, but NO BLISTERS!! This is an amazing testament to the power of BodyGlide because sometimes I can have blisters wearing normal shoes during a normal, low activity work-day, and I was walking for hours at a time over bricks, cobblestones, you-name-it. If you are going to be traveling where you will be walking more than usual or on a differnt terrain then you are used to, buy a big, ol stick of Bodyglide and coat your feet every day
Wasn't anything special. You can go to any beauty supply store and get a similar oil that's half the price.
This book contains the childhood memoirs of Peter Reich.  As the son of psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich, Peter led a bizarre life.  He lived with his parents on the family estate of Orgonon in the backwoods of Maine.  Not only did his father develop a unique form of psychotherapy, but he also was a theorist who experimented with unknown forms of energy.  As Wilhelm's only child, Peter was one of the first recipients of Reich's therapy methods, which involved special forms of touch, energy channeling, "softening the stomach", and inducing vomiting (in Peter's account). Peter was also made lieutenant in his father's defensive squad that protected the earth from UFO attacks through the use of "accumulator guns".  The elder Reich eventually got in trouble with the FDA for manufacturing and promoting medical equipment without proper testing for safety and effectiveness.  The court case involving his work eventually landed him in jail through contempt of court.  Not long after being sent to prison, he passed away, apparently of heart failure.  Upon his father's death, Peter found himself at the tender age of 13 forced to confront his father's legacy of brilliance and madness.  Up until the time of his father's death, he had believed everything his father told him, not knowing enough of contemporary scientific theories to understand how different his father's version of reality was from most other people's, nor having established an identity of his own through which he could objectively choose between his father's explanations and standard scientific approaches.  In this book, Peter tries to sort out for himself what is real and what is not, what is his, and what is his father's. ---  --- The book reads like the proverbial onion-chapters move in a dreamlike fashion from one period of time to another.  Sometimes it's hard to tell if what Peter is describing actually took place, or whether it was all an imaginative game in his head.  By the end of the book, the reader will have some inkling of the confusion in Peter's mind, but, like Peter, may not be capable of saying what really happened.  In any case, this is very much a book about Peter Reich, and not Wilhelm Reich, although readers who want to learn more about Wilhelm Reich may find some clues to his ideas through the interpretation of his son, who experienced them first hand and without question
I LOVED "Never Cry Wolf"!!!  I saw it years ago on video, but can only imagine the DVD is as good or better.  I was disappointed to see that it was listed with 'The Bear' to buy together....  I love Anthony Hopkins, and the Bear was one of the worst movies I have EVER seen.  Don't let the pairing with 'The Bear' scare you off.  "Never Cry Wolf" is excellent! --- Sorry Tony :-)  Okay, I just realized that 'The Edge' was the one with Anthony Hopkins... my apologies to the Bear!   Anyway, get "Never Cry Wolf"!  You won't be disappointed!!
I love The Who, a big part of my youth, probably in my DNA, but let's not kid ourselves: This is professional rock and roll made by professional rock and rollers. Is there any lyric here that Pete hasn't written before? Still writing about getting your first hit single?! And sadly the music sounds like Face Dances and All the Best Cowboys..etc, but not The Who Sell Out or Empty Glass. The band itself sounds faceless, generic. The only redeeming features are the raspy passion in Roger's voice and Pete's right hand.  --- I hope the complete album makes garbage of this review, but unless Pete has written truthfully and passionately about something or anything of what his life and the world has been like in the last twenty years I'm afraid, like Wire & Glass, it will only be a rehash of previous works, no matter how good it sounds. Here's hoping I'm wrong
I just received this watch and I have to say it's very sharp looking not to mention has some weight to it. This is not a flimsy watch by any means. It's all stainless steel and the clasp is the easiest I have ever had to negotiate of all the watches I have gone through over the years. It's very secure lock yet simple to unclasp. I would recommend this watch to anyone. Also, it's dressy and casual ~ all purpose watch
This camera case fits the camera perfectly and the extra battery is a MUST.  The price of the two items together is the same as the battery alone in local electronics stores.  So, I look at it as getting the case for free!
Apparently you need to "know" your technical specs -- Universal does not mean Nokia, so after getting the product and on the packaging reading clearly there that it doesn't work with Nokia, I get the expense of sending it back. This should be on the technical specs which are crap on this site
This item is advertised as boufant and oversized. It is anything but.... --- The shower cap is so tiny, it would fit on a grapefruit.This kind of false advertising is what discourages us from ordering on line
It has a samsung logo, but it looks fake after I bought it. The belt clipper tore of the phone holder with no reason
Decent quality, and no issues with interference at this frequency. Cannot be beat for the price
Well after all the media attention Bully has arrived. It would seem that all those nutty parental groups were wrong again. May be now they'll focus on some real problems facing our poor children. Not only did this game prove not to be a "Columbine" handbook it tries to show a better way to deal with the problems facing teens.Well the rant is over now for the rave. The game mechanics are excellent. Like many of Rockstar titles they've improved on the GTA engine allowing smoother play. Stepping away from the mission types in the GTA series Bully had to have better ideas without falling back on the GTA typical T&A/wholesale killing. Now don't get me wrong I enjoy the GTA series, and most of Rockstar's other releases.  I never passed shop class though. Seeing the GTA open ended engine applied to another series just shows me the various directions they can go in as far as game creation.The mini-games are fun and addictive. I wish they would have other classes represented. With Bully you get to not only play a great game, but some of us old folks will travel back to a simpler time. Overall this is an excellent game, worth your time, and a is a fine example of how stupid the media and those parental groups can be.
I don't know what was wrong w/ the other reviewers machine, but let me assure you, this is NOT an inferior product. I got it on Clearance @ Target for $69.98. I have been looking for a long time for a good portable DVD player. I have used it and had NO problems with it whatsoever. Plus if anything does happen in the first 90 it is fully returnable to Target. Good Deal all around. Highly reccomended.
Very nice scale, worked wonderfully for a family member of mine with poor eyesigh
I had a difficult time finding the sanding sugar.  There are no stores in my area that carry it.  I was very surprised to find it on Amazon.  The store I bought it from was quick to deliver and I was very pleased with the price of the product.  I received a generous amount and was able to "dust" all my sugar cookies! Thank you
It made my breasts look funny, it made my nipples more irritable & it left painful marks on my breasts. Hardly ever used it. :
I subscribed to this magazine for a year and found it a waste of money. Every issue has a girl in a bikini on the front (can't a woman look sexy in anything but?) And every issue claims to have "the best ever exercise for...." ok..what about the last 10 issues that claimed to have the same thing..those exercises are no longer "best ever?" I didn't like the fashion sections, and I also don't like how there really aren't any articles. When I subscribe to a magazine I'd like to be able to read it, not just look at pictures. The only thing I liked about it were the success stories..and even those seemed repetitive...are we only allowed fruit and grilled chicken?
All men can do anything, if they will seems to be the final statement of this captivating picture, carefully directed by Agnieszka Holland, one of the major female directors in the world. ---  --- This absorbing drama turns around the lives and times of three children who will meet each one another and exchange livings and fortunate encounters.  ---  --- On one hand, our little girl will know the world is not turning around her; and her initial solitude will be rewarded when she found out a hiddden that will make her dreams come true, and finally she will the one in order to impluse and bring back her cousin to the life. ---  --- A triumph of the cinema and definitively one of my top twenty best films of the Nineties.
Ordered 2lbs based upon the positive reviews. I am happy with the quality of the jerky and taste of the product, I will buy again. My kids love the stuff, not a bad snack
I am fortunate enough to have met Ms. Elaine Stone herself and find her style to be that of great elegance, sophistication, grace, and poshness.  She is by far the most fashionable person I have yet to meet.  Reading The  Dynamics of Fashion as my textbook for my FM114 class I found it very  informant and recommend it to everyone, even those who are not a student of  fashion
I purchased this game for my son and he loves it.  He plays for hours and really enjoys racing the cars.  I'm glad that we selected this game for him, he also has Underground - Hot Pursuit and he enjoys that one also
This bench was the best combination I could find that did both sit ups and hyper back exercises.  It works suprisingly well for what it costs.  The lower leg holder can be set low for back exercises, and set higher for sit ups.  The padding and covers seem decent.  Lots of adjustments.  It's not as heavy duty as the ones at gyms, but for at home I am satisfied
It took so long for this to come out...I hated the little hints they gave us hardcore NDers on the Dare to Play message board. I had extremely high hopes for this game--I adored Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon and waited AGES for this game. ---  --- Now, besides the absurd level of difficulty in this game [it was seemingly VERY hard in my eyes--I could not make it the first time through without the assistance of a walkthrough], I LOVED it. The flight to Paris and the travel about the city--it was also a LOT easier to make money in this game than in Secret of the Old Clock. ---  --- I did not like how hard the puzzles were, but all in all it was an amazing game. There was a lot of talking, and that can really slow down gameplay and frustrate a gamer. And puzzles like the darkroom, the paintbomb and the cookies were absurdly difficult. But otherwise it was worth it
Purchased this for our grandchildren.  IT DID NOT WORK! Unfortunately we had thrown away the original packaging, so I assumed that it could not be returned.  It gets zero stars from this household even if the form does require at least one star be entered.
The main appeal of the Grand Theft Auto franchise has always been the freedom it gives the player to explore vast amounts of territory and cause mayhem as he sees fit. San Andreas contains by far the most audacious expansion on the landmass available to you. This time the action takes place in California inspired locales such as Los Santos, San Fierro and the Las Vegas inspired Las Venturas, all within the enormous state of San Andreas. The main inspiration this time around is the fascination with ghetto culture that was so predominant in the early 90's. This provides a great opportunity for Rockstar to take advantage of the setting and implement some new challenges for the player to conquer. New to Grand Theft Auto is the concept of territory control, as a member of a street gang the player has the opportunity to take over every available territory in Los Santos later on in the game. Perhaps the most notable additions to the franchise are the ability to customize your character's appearance and improve his varied skills throughout the game. These may seem like rather superficial additions but they are surprisingly satisfying when implemented properly. The character's skill growth happens naturally and rarely interferes with the freeform exploration that players have come to expect from the series. The customization of your avatar varies greatly and encompasses most fashion styles found during the early `90s in California. The lower tier stores offer the usual assortment of baggy pants and sports jerseys while the more expensive stores offer suits, expensive jewelry and trendy fashions. Your characters appearance can be as varied as you want it to be and it does not stop at just clothes and tattoos, his physical fitness can also be changed. ---  --- The Grand Theft Auto franchise has improved in almost all aspects with each subsequent release and this one proves to be no different. As the last game in the series to use this outdated engine it pushes it as far as it can go in terms of graphical prowess. The graphics are slightly improved over the previous installment but they remain sub par to the standard featured in most games released around the same time. Nonetheless the visuals are quite effective as the sunsets fill San Andreas in an orange tint and the game's color palette faithfully replicates the feel of the early nineties California culture. ---  --- The soundtrack aptly replicates the time period which San Andreas draws its visual style from and perhaps the one complaint on this subject would be that Rockstar seems to try and encompass far too many genres of music. The expected genres can be found, such as Hip-Hop and Alternative Rock, both of which had a strong presence in the early nineties pop scene. However, some stations seem oddly out of place in the game world's era. Dance music and Funk each get their own stations yet it hardly seems worth it, although too much choice is never a bad thing. Making a welcomed return are the various radio station DJs, who each pepper the time between tracks with hilarious chat and amusing observations. For those that would prefer to listen to nothing but banter there are two radio stations with a talk radio format, one public station holding discussions on the day's political events and another with light talk shows. Either one of these stations is more than enough to keep the player amused for hours but just in case the PC version gives you the added bonus of playing your own MP3 tracks by adding them to the game's music library. ---  --- The sound effects themselves seem appropriate but never particularly impressive. There is the usual banter among pedestrians and the complaints from motorists as you pull them out of their vehicle and run off with their ride. All these things add a little bit of life to the game's large cities and the voice work varies enough to cover all the different geographical areas that San Andreas contains. The thick southern accents of the countryside inhabitants and the snobbish tone of the civilians in the rich neighborhoods are all present. The gunfire and explosions sound average, with not much improvement present since Vice City. ---  --- Despite the controversy that seems to follow every release in the series San Andreas is a praiseworthy title in and of itself. An engrossing action game that continues to expand its limits while continuing to deliver what fans of the series have come to expect
For the English-language reader Wedgwood's book, which has been in print for over sixty years, is still an excellent introduction and synoptic narrative of this lengthy and turbulent period of European history.  It gives brief and judicious biographical sketches of the major political and military actors of three generations:  The principal antagonists at the outset -- Ferdinand II of Austria and Frederick V, Elector Palatine;  the condottieri-style generals - Spinola, von Mansfeld, Tilly, Wallenstein, Piccolomini, Christian of Halberstadt, Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar, the duc d'Enghien (Conde); the contentious minor rulers --  Maximilian V of Bavaria, Johann Georg of Saxony; the northern monarchs -- Christian IV of Denmark and Gustavus Adophus of Sweden (and his daughter Christina and prime minister, Oxenstierna); the "spoiler", Cardinal Richelieu; the new Emperor Ferdinand III and his cousin, the warlord Cardinal-Infant Ferdinand of Spain; and many others.  This book is written in a traditional English historian's  prose style that is clear, eloquent and totally lacking the jargon of concurrent and later social and economic histories, while still covering these aspects of the period.  In spite of some reviewers' claims of a "Protestant bias" in her interpretation, the author seems extremely fair when assessing responsibility for the long-running disaster of the war, taking the position that it was the self-serving political interests of  the participants (dynasties, rulers, generals and paymasters) that kept the war going at the expense of the social and economic welfare of the vast majority of inhabitants of Germany and Bohemia. ---  ---      Although I am not familiar with this new edition (and Grafton's introduction) I emphasize that any reissuing of this book should have a brief scholarly introduction which supplies more details on the constitutional arrangements and crises of the Holy Roman Empire during the sixteenth century, with a special emphasis on the composition of the Bohemian estates and the conflicts between the estates and the Habsburg king-emperors.  The extent and internal organization of "the Bohemian crown lands" should also be outlined.  A succinct review of the political status of Lutheranism, Calvinism, the Bohemian Brethren, and other Protestant confessions throughout all of Europe around the year 1600 and  a note on how their status had altered by 1700 would also be useful in "setting the stage" for the events of 1618 and understanding the relgious-denomination consequences of the war. ---  ---      The author supplies sufficient details on the major battles, but this is not a work of military history.  As Wedgwood knows, battles were only significant in the larger view as a result of their  political consequences.  And it is in the elucidation of the underlying politics of the war (including how political prospects shifted with the waxing and waning of military fortunes) that Wedgwood excels.  In her analysis of the general European situation at the outset of the war she proposes that there were three sets of  forces which underlay and drove contemporary events.  Each was a source of conflict and each might cross-cut the others, complicating the declared interests and objectives of the dynasties and nations involved.  In brief, the forces were: (a) Religion, with three major competing factions (Catholic, Lutheran, Calvinist; she notes that the conflict between the latter two forms of Protestantism was often as extreme as it was between each of them and the Roman Catholic Church).  (b)  Nationalism (French, German, Czech, etc.), which was a new force on the scene, crystallizing the idea that political entities might be defined by nationality (which here equals some combination of ethnicity and native language) rather than conceived of as polyglot territorial agglomerations brought about by dynastic interests. (c) Monarchic-constitutional issues, which were especially complicated and ambiguous within the "constitutional" grouping of major and minor powers known as The Holy Roman Empire (HRE). ---  ---      The constitutional problem was twofold.  Within the small arenas of developing nation states and the yet smaller ones of traditional rulerships throughout Europe (duchies, counties, "free-city" areas ruled by town councils and mayors) contests over the basis and extent of the rulers' powers and privileges were taking place.  Aristocrats, oligarchs and merchants had traditional corporate bodies (estates) reluctant to cede their own powers (taxation, the organization of military service) to a central authority.  The same conflict was also being played out on the larger scale of the  Hly Roman Epire, that loose grouping of special obligations and exemptions  which was the final residue of an earlier system of vassalage binding together the elected Emperor (who had been a Habsburg for several centuries) and the smaller rulerships of Central Europe.  The religious reforms, rebellions and wars of the sixteenth century had produced a system that appeared to resolve some of the potential problems through the won privilege of cujus regio, eius religio ("whoever rules, his religion [is the religion of the ruled area]").  In the year of the war's inception, 1618, this new balance was very fragile, comprising four Catholic and three Protestant imperial Electors.   In Germany the special arrangements regulating relationships between the Emperor (resident in Vienna or Prague) and local rulers and guaranteeing a great deal of political autonomy to the locals, especially the Protestant Electors, had been somewhat codified by the Augsburg Treaty of 1555, and were known as the "German Liberties".  These would prove to be especially important to the three Protestant Electors at the outset of the war. ---  ---     In the developing continental war one could be pro- or anti-Habsburg based on any one of the above factors or any combination of two or three of them.  For example, a Catholic ruler (including the papacy) might seek Protestant allies in order to combat Habsburg territorial expansion in his direction or to combat constitutional changes in the Empire which affected his position adversely.  Or a Protestant power might accept the Habsburg "program" in any given case because it did not wish to disturb constitutional arrangements that were to its advantage (this  characterization is apt for Saxony and Brandenburg during the first twelve years of the war.)   ---  ---      As Wedgwood notes, all three considerations (religion, nationality, constitutional relations) could be and were used cynically to advance the positions and interests of individual rulers and factions.  From the point of view of rationality or predictability, political choices and commitments were often self-contradictory (e.g., a Catholic power supporting a Protestant venture; a German Liberties party accepting occupation by the army of a foreign power, etc.) or  temporary expedients that made the overall European situation more chaotic.  The war began locally in Bohemia, but its complications and consequences radiated outward as far west as Spain and England (even farther, to the Caribbean naval theater), as far north as Sweden and northeast to Poland, as far south as Italy and southeast as Transylvania; in other words, it was a European continental war with global impact. ---  ---     When the war broke out in 1618 it was over the Habsburg violation of a "constitutional guarantee" of religious freedom in Bohemia (the concessions stated in Rudolf II's Letter of Majesty).  And here is where individual personalities and beliefs played an important role.  Ferdinand II, who had knowingly violated the terms of the Letter soon after being selected by the Bohemian Diet as King (and therefore the first in precedence of the HRE Electors) was determined not only to expand the political powers of the Habsburg dynasty in Bohemia and elsewhere, he was firmly committed to the goals of the Catholic Counter-Reformation (i.e., re-Catholicizing all of the areas within the HRE which had become Protestant during the last one hundred years).  When he was deposed by a special convention of the Bohemian estates (the defenestration of his deputies in Prague being the signal event of this deposition), the crown of Bohemia was offered to the Elector of the (Rhineland) Palatinate, Frederick V, who considered himself a champion of the Protestant cause.  The religious zeal of these two antagonists led to extreme fixed positions at the very outset of the war. ---  ---     Given the other major conflict hovering in the background  -- the Spanish Habsburg determination to recover the now Protestant area of the Netherlands which had become the successful and defiant (Dutch) United Provinces - the war soon became international. While the entry of France and then Denmark followed by Sweden, into the war during the 1620's changed its nature and extended its duration, Wedgwood concentrates much of her analysis on the behavior of the two Protestant Electors, Johann Georg of Saxony and Georg Wilhelm of Brandenburg and one Catholic ruler, Maximilian of Bavaria.  It is her contention throughout the book that Johann Georg and Maximilian in particular could have prevented the war's spread and forced Ferdinand into a compromise very early in the course of events that acquired their own dynamism once they got out of hand.  Despite their religious differences these two were always strong "German Liberties" proponents, and each had the same view of the Austrian  Habsburg rulers:  they should be kept for the broader protections they offered, but kept in place with respect to encroachments on the traditional rights of local rulers.  In the end both of these rulers survived the lengthy war in spite of numerous diplomatic and military reversals (Saxony switched sides and joined the Swedes for several years, while Maximilian's position was constantly and secretly supported by  his nominal enemies, the French, as their potential foot in the Habsburg camp.)  Wedgwood believes that the price of their survival was far too costly for the rest of Germany. ---  ---      Wedgwood's gloss on the changing nature of the conflict is that by the year 1635 the war had become one of great-power politics, and that the earlier religious and ideological causes were losing their ability to motivate the antagonists.  Her summary of the changes emphasizes the following: ---  --- (a)  Religion had  discredited itself as a plausible source of political programs and a legitimate cause for war.  Religion was becoming more interiorized and private, and losing ground philosophically and ethically to the new prestige of empirical and applied science (this was the era of Galileo and Kepler, with Descartes, Harvey, Hook, Newton, Huygens, etc. on the near horizon; a time of laboratory science and scientific societies.)  As the basis of a political program religion was viewed cynically by those who saw the devastation it had brought about. ---  --- (b)  For thinking men, nationalism began to fill the emotional void in public life left by the withdrawal of religion as the underlying motive for political and cultural action.  This was very obvious in France, but even true of Ferdinand III, for whom the new main cause was the construction of an Austrian-based hereditary monarchy whose additional obligations as the Holy Roman Imperial  protector of  far-flung  German Catholics were no longer perceived as worthwhile.  In the minds of both Germans and Austrian Habsburgs the Holy Roman Empire was becoming an honorific entity with ambiguous and weak political commitments in Germany.  The Elbe-North German-Pomeranian ideal empire of Wallenstein was never again revived as a dynastic program.  Austria began to move south and east (toward Italy, Croatia, and Hungary) in its expansionist aims. ---  --- (c)  The control of immense polyglot, multi-religious, mercenary armies and their huge camp followings had become a pressing matter of concern for all of the political authorities that hired them - they were neither religious nor national in their motives and aims and were in fact independent "mobile states" unto themselves, cynical and rapacious and often as dangerous to their paymasters as to their foes; whenever their immediate prospects for pay and maintenance looked bad, they changed sides.  The most successful mercenary generals had become mini-sovereigns.  Officers were all "out for themselves" and for their troops (rather than for the cause or nation of their paymaster), since without troop loyalty they had no means of personal advancement  -- the most famous commanders, Ernst von Mansfeld, Wallenstein, Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar, the Swedish general Wrangel, all expected (and some received) grants of territory and titles of nobility as their rewards for service. The "national" armies of conscripts that came to the fore in the 18th century was the answer to this problem.  ---  ---      The pace of the war wound down during its last five years (although there were several major battles fought even then), which was a period of extended negotiatons in Münster and Osnabrück, with the "final treaty" being signed late in 1648.  For the next five years a series of conferences met at Nürnberg to implement and enforce the peace treaty and to deal with difficult problems raised by demobilizing huge armies. Many of the loans of this period, which were raised to cover the demobilization costs, were not paid off for a century.   Individual rulers such as Charles of Lorraine and the Duke of Savoy (who got nothing from the treaty) refused to vacate various fortresses for five or six years, but the war did not break out again.  France and Spain continued at war with each other, but not in Germany.  Numerous soldiers, especially officers, went into mercenary service all over Europe.   Others took to the hills as professional bandits - for the next 20 years merchants traveled through certain parts of Germany and Bohemia in armed caravans. ---  ---      Wedgwood accepts the more recent (1900-1930's) historical estimate that the population of the Imperial German lands (excluding Alsace and the Netherlands) dropped from about 21 million in 1618 to 13 million in 1648.  The number of dislocated people was also substantial.   While she acknowledges that the number of towns and villages destroyed and other "infrastructural" and economic losses were very large, she feels that all contemporary sources (e.g., the pamphlet literature of the next 100 years) exaggerated local losses, since all parties in the war continued to seek indemnities and restitution.  The free peasantry benefited briefly, since landowners were desperate for manpower to restore their estates  - prices fell while wages rose for a number of years, which increased the standard of living of peasants and artisans.  But within a decade of the peace treaty the landowning gentry was pleading with Imperial, royal and local rulers to impose legal  restrictions  which would re-create bonded, serf-like conditions for peasants. Town councils now became pawns and bureaucrats of  the dynastic courts of their rulers and also implemented restrictive legislations on peasants (e.g., prohibitions against mobility, domestic industry, and household craft production  -- a trend which later historians refer to as "neo-serfdom").   Class stratification was as rigid as it was before the war started.  There was a new, large class of mobile petty nobles and gentry seeking court-backed military and bureaucratic appointments, at the expense of town and peasant taxpayers.   ---  ---      Germany and the Austrian-based monarchy and empire were totally excluded from the international competition to establish overseas colonies and from the developing "Atlantic trade".   For a number of years the outlets of Germany's major rivers (Rhine, Elbe, Oder, and for Brandenburg-Prussia, Vistula) were controlled by  foreign powers, reducing Germany's commercial strength.  Hamburg was the exception, becoming the major maritime merchant city of the North Sea coast, at the expense of the other Hanseatic cities and the Scandinavian powers.  The only medium-sized German state to emerge with positive prospects was Brandenburg, soon to become the administratively efficient and militarily powerful Prussia.  The peace, while ending the "wars of religion",  set the stage for a long series of "nationalistic" wars that subsumed dynastic and religious sources of conflict.  France replaced the Habsburg Spanish-Austrian coalition as the menacing and tyrannical continental power willing to disturb the peace.  Austria turned to the south and east and Spain lost its great power status and became an economic and cultural backwater.  There was no politically or culturally unified Germany within the boundaries of the old Empire (French culture began to reign supreme) and the cosmopolitanism (its openness to outside influences) of this area during the 18th century, instead of being a source of pride over its achievements, became a source of lament for later cultural and ethnic purists of  revived German nationalism. ---  ---      Author's Judgment and Conclusions:    In terms of  responsibility for the overall disaster, Wedgwood points to the futility and self-destructiveness of sincere religious zeal in the cases of Ferdinand II and the Elector Palatine.  But, from the point of view of failures of practical (and ethical) politics, she highlights the behavior of Maximilian and Johann Georg, who could have prevented the spread of the conflict in 1620 and could have brought the war to an early end in 1635 if they had agreed to work together on a "unified German program" which would have forced Imperial compromises and concessions had they both stood behind it.  Between these two she sees the Saxon as the greater victim of military circumstances (pressed by the Swedish juggernaut) and therefore less culpable for the mess, while she judges the Bavarian as too subtle and too ambitious in pursuit of his own dynastic and territorial ambitions at the expense of a general settlement good for his fellow Germans, thus identifying him as the more culpable.   ---  ---      Beautiful in its style and concision, Wedgwood's final summary is also gloomy (as one might expect of a work completed in 1939, on the verge of World War II):   ---  ---      "As there was no compulsion towards a conflict which, in despite of the apparent bitterness of the parties, took so long to engage and needed so much assiduous blowing to fan the flame, so no right was vindicated by its ragged end.  The war solved no problem.  Its effects, both immediate and indirect, were either negative or disastrous.  Morally subversive, economically destructive, socially degrading, confused in its causes, devious in its course, futile in its result, it is the outstanding example in European history of meaningless conflict."
Blend a little apple cider mix into your Tazo Passion Tea and see what happens. This creates a magical apple cider experience with hints of cranberry and hibiscus flowers gathered in an ancient land.  ---  --- Snuggle Up Spiced Cider is a good choice because you can then spoon in the exact amount you desire, but packets of cider work equally well. This is the type of tea you would expect to enjoy after skiing in some distant forest where you are also munching on homemade brownies or eggnog cookies. Apple cider also works very well with the Gypsy Teas, especially the Lemon Jasmine.  ---  --- The deep purple/red color and hibiscus fragrance of Tazo Tea is enough to make anyone passionate about tea. Yet, is this really tea? It looks like tea, but it is really an herbal infusion made by steeping hibiscus flowers, orange peel, licorice, cinnamon, rose hips, lemongrass and red poppy in a swirling of hot water. ---  --- The original flavor is also slightly reminiscent of hot apple cider or hot cranberry juice which is why it is extra delicious with a cider mix. Tazo Teas are a mysterious experience into which you can lose yourself with a sense of abandon. So far I've tried more flavors than I can count and have always been impressed. ---  --- ~The Rebecca Review 
These are the best! They remind me of rice crispy treats. They're so chewy and delicious. I recommend these to anyone who loves peanut butter products
This was just a boring movie...can't understand the other --- review's saying it's good. Wouldn't reccomend it
For someone who knows nothing about Guitars and how to tune them, this tuner is a "must have"!  Came w/batteries (AAA) and clear instructions. 1)Turn on 2)pick string 3)adjust until you get the correct note.  Once I looked up the correct notes, it was simple.  It will even tell me if I'm playing the correct cord.  I tried to tune by listening to a Beginner CD and trying to replicate the sound as they suggest, but on computer speakers, it just doesn't work.  This little tuner ROCKS!
A difficult item to find in department stores.  Found some at twice the price in a leather goods store.  The Fossil leather key cases were of equal quality.  I purchased two and am very satisfied
Finally - a grill cover that actually stays on the grill and protects it in the worst weather.  The velcro straps keep it secure but it is very easy to remove when ready to use the grill.  This has to be the 4th or 5th grill cover we've tried and it will be the last one we try.  I would recommend this product to anyone investing iin a grill.  Why not spend a couple bucks more so that your $400 grill doesn't rust out in two seasons
My kids have tried I think all the gluten/wheat free ones and by far this is their favorite.  They stay hard in milk and I, an adult, even like them
Great for if you are not near a computer and need to charge your Ipo
We had purchased another hair beader where you placed a clasp at the bottom of the beds to keep the beds from falling out of your hair. The idea of this product where you could place a single bead on your hair was very intriguing.  My daughter was excited when she opened the box and  she had decorated her hair with multiple beads and it looked nice.  The problem started when we attempted to remove the beads from her hair.  The directions tell you go gently pull the springs apart and slide them from your hair.  Well, we pulled the springs apart but to get the beads out of her hair we needed to destroy the bead because the hair was tangled in the springs.  None of the beads could be reused and my daughter is afraid to use the product again because it pulled her hair when we removed the beads.  She has very long hair with a lot of wave so I guess if you had short, straight hair, this product would be fine for you
this is good for when you go on a trip you know it will keep your streetpilot going. and it isn't bulky. and it's made with quality just like the streetpilot itself
Now, I have been playing tennis for 8 years and I must say, this is my favorite racket I have used. I have been using it for about two years or so and plan on using it for many more. It seems Head Liquidmetal rackets are gaining alot of popularity and I have seen more players using them within the last year or so. For me, the strings break roughly every 3 or 5 months. However, if you play at a less competitive level. They will break twice a year maybe. If you're just starting to play tennis, I don't think this would be a good racket to begin with, however if you play for a while and find yourself enjoying the sport and wish to play long term, this is the racket you need. Enjoy
These slippers are typical of Daniel Green products, beautiful, comfortable and affordable. --- Thank
Oh, how I wanted to love Devon's book! He was such a charming rascal in "Wicked..." and such a bore in "Sinful..". There was no meat to this story. The back of the books summarizes it nicely. What would have made a better short story in an anthology was dragged on for over 300 pages. I admit I only made through about half before skimming and realizing it wasn't going to get any better. ---  --- There's no sizzling tension, the love scenes weak, and the mystery is predictable. I had such high expectations for this Boscastle book since Drake's was brilliant and Devon's character seemed such a lovable rogue. ---  --- Not a keeper for me. ---  ---  --- 
This is my favorite cereal ever. Since I started eating only organic, I picked this up one day and I love it. I eat it every morning for breakfast
GOOD: Bought watch Feb 1 2007 --- BAD: First watch showed up dead - not working. Battery?  --- GOOD: Amazon replaced next day --- BAD: Second watch showed up dead- not working. Battery? --- GOOD: Worked fine when I had the battery replaced.(+$10 out of pocket) --- BAD: First time in the shower, filled with water --- GOOD: Amazon sent another watch the next day --- BAD: was the same exact watch, I had returned first time still not working --- GOOD: Amazon agreed to refund money when they recieve the watches --- BAD: April 10th still waiting for refund ---  ---  --- I had a very similar watch from pulsar that I bought in 1991 - that watch lasted over 15 years with no problems. the LCD stopped working so I finally broke down and bought a new watch. I was shocked and disappointed with amazon sending me 3 dead watches - esp after talking to them asbout making sure it just works before sending it. the final watch was the exact same watch I returned for NOT working.
I bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it, or have already bought it--it's size.  It is amazingly small, it's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera.  I take it with me everywhere,literally, it is so small that I am able to keep it in my pocket, and I don't have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable. There is also a small covering for the lens, so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched. --- The picture quality surprised me, when I first saw this camera I saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good--but I was wrong!  The picture quality of this camera is outstanding (taking its' size and price into consideration). ---  --- However, I do have a few things to complain about... ---  --- First off, the battery.  This camera uses a lithium battery, I find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient; because what if you are on vacation, where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station--there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there.  Not only is it inconvenient, but also the battery life span is short.  The longest I've had it work was about 1 hour and 45 minutes.  This isn't uncommon in cameras, though, just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries, you should be fine. ---  --- Another problem I had with this camera was the zoom function.  Such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in...wrong!  Very wrong.  The zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet.  Even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little, resulting in a noisy start-up. ---  --- The flash is very weak.  Really dissapointing. If you are inside, you can't be any farther away then 10 feet in a lit room. ---  --- The last problem I found with this camera was the macro function.  The auto-focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject.  To make matters work, there is no manual override to overcome this problem.  The focus is great, though, if you are not taking a macro shot. ---  --- These are all the flaws I found in the camera, it's not my first choice in cameras, I have come across many other beginner cameras that I prefer over this camera, but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size.  If you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times, then this is a great camera choice. 
I am quiet satisfied with the T10.  --- 3 cons:  --- no reset button, AA battery type (I prefer litium ion) , primitive menu. ---  --- 3 Pros:  --- mp3 + voice record + fm radio --- good sound quality --- belt clip ---  --- Overall success: 80 %
I have had this camera for about a year and a half.  I got so fed up with it that I just bought a new one.  I admit, this camera takes decent pictures in good lighting when the zoom isn't used.  However, this camera takes horrible pictures if the zoom is used.  I would only recomomend this camera to someone who just wants to take pictures of of thier surroundings or to a younger person who is getting their first digital camera
The title of this product is a joke.  It should be called "Not Easy CD burning".  Roxio version 5 was much easier than this one is.  It is way too complicated for burning simple CDs
I read some other reviews that were poor, but I disagree.  My son loves this toy.  He smiles when he sees the turtle from across his room.  It plays music continually for 12 minutes. So, in the middle of the night when he wakes up, I turn it on and he's asleep by the time it runs out.  We have moved it twice and the straps seemed sturdy.  However, it is recommended that this toy be removed when the child is 5 months old or is able to get on hands and knees. This completely contradicts the interactive play mode, since the baby needs to be both physically and mentally developed to a stage beyond 5 months to reach all the buttons.
I love this product. I had a sample version of it prior to that expired, and I NEEDED to have the full edition. It came in a timely fashion as well. I am very pleased
Great little case we have two. I like the inside pocket for extra memory/battery.  
I was looking for a crispy crunchy, not too sweet, flavorful biscotti.  This prduct certainlyn fills the bill
When I saw this tub, I thought WoW this is great.  It had everything.   ---  --- Well after receiving the tub as a gift for my shower I decided to try it before the baby came.  I am so glad that I did.  The pump for the spa and shower was super loud and had a leak. The shower was very difficult to operate, I had to press really hard.   ---  --- The only thing that I loved about the tub was the sling.  It is very nice. I think when it comes to buying a tub for a baby simple is better... in the beginning speed is key, the baby gets to cold to really enjoy the features of this tub.  In my opinion get a simple tub and splurge on something else.
I love fairy tales!  I was so excited to see the author of Beauty had another retelling.  Spindles End has me very confused.  I am plugging through it and hope when I am done with it a second time I can give it more stars.  I would not recommend it for younger readers
IT IS A HORRIBLE ITEM.  IF I COULD HAVE GIVEN THIS HAIRAGAMI A NO STAR RATING, I WOULD HAVE, AND TO THINK I WASTED ALMOST $20 FOR THIS JUNK. IT SNAPS UNEXPECTEDLY ALL THE TIME, AND ALWAYS WHILE YOU ARE TWIRLING THE HAIR.  IT TOTALLY TANGLES THE HAIR. IT IS A NIGHTMARE TO GET OUT OF YOUR CHILD'S HAIR. --- MY OLDEST, 12, REALLY WANTED THIS HAIRAGAMI AND WAS TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED. --- SHE TOLD ALL HER FRIENDS NOT TO BUY IT
Since I bought the Grado Signature HP-2 headphone in 1992, the only complaint I had was that the cord was not long enough.  The same is true with today's Grado lineup and most competitors.  I could not find a quality extension cable for under $100 and even then it degraded the sound. ---  --- But this $39 15 foot exention cord from Grado really does the job big time.  I now also own a new pair of SR-60's and both headphones sound great.  I can sit anywhere in my living room and enjoy the sound.  Grado made a great product at an affordable and reasonable price.......but this describes all of Grado's products...doesn't i
I spent the extra on this alarm because I wanted a projection feature. ---  --- The projection feature lasted 2 weeks. ---  --- I also had a wall clock made by LaCrosse that does not accurately reflect either the temperature or the humidity. ---  --- Save your money, folks. ---  --- Hopefully, Amazon will refund my $$
I know that no book can cover every topic, but this book left a lot out. It went into great detail about what I should do if I got some pretty rare diseases, but barely touched on the subject of Morning sickness, which is much more common.  --- And some of the information was just plain wrong. I trashed the book when it made me freak out in the 20th week because I couldn't feel the baby move. It advised that I should call the doctor. When I did, I found out most women don't feel it move until 21 weeks. Unfortunately I found this out after I had cried my eyes out thinking something was wrong. --- I would not suggest this book to anyone
These lollipops are intense & delicious.  My kids love them, and so do my co-workers
I purchased this at my 10 year olds request for a birthday present.  I was skeptical, but since it was the only thing requested, I bought it.  We've had it 4 weeks.  What a great pool toy!  Kids love it!  We have a 22 foot above ground pool, and it works fine.  I have bought floats for upwards of $25 dollars, so for the cost of the Wave Cruiser you can't go wrong.  It seems to be well built and sturdy.  I wouldn't hesitate to get on it.  Takes 8 "D" batteries that are in a water tight case.  It will tip over as will any pool float when the rider gets rowdy, but that seems to be part of the fun for the kids.  Overall great gift idea
I bought this camera for my girlfriend and she loves it. It has all the basic functions her older Coolpix had abut more and they're a bit more user friendly.  --- Pros: Compact and easy to Hold. I've had a few other Point and Shoots and they feel like they are going to jump out of my hand. This one feels pretty good.  --- Cons: Before buying I read the reviews and a few were stating that the focus was not everything it should be. I will agree. That is the cameras only real big down fall. Though my girlfriend may not notice it so much, to me it's a little more aparant. --- For the most part, overall I really like this little guy..
This Electromate 400 saved me serveral times I will never be with out another one. Love it. I ordered this from Amazon one day and the next day it was here Very fast shipping. Well pleased Thank yo
Call me a traditionalist, but I prefer the original, jam-filled Pop Tarts with none of the overly sweet frosting on top. As a child, I liked it right out of the toaster and would take it with me on the way to school. This portable variation seems to me like a misstep from the outset. The moment I ripped open the flimsy packaging, the Go-Tart bar crumbled out of my hand and onto the floor. Apparently the manufacturers at Kellogg's decided to use the same bread-like consistency they use for their standard Pop-Tarts on this bar. Especially with the shipping aspect introduced by Amazon, I think this is a mistake since I assume the whole idea behind this iteration of the snack is the portability aspect. ---  --- On top of the bar is the same execrable, sprinkle-laden white frosting I avoided once it was introduced as an enhancement so many years ago. Without the ability of toasting the bar, I find little point to the frosting except as a purposeless sugar-rush. Consequently, I cannot agree with its description as a "ready-to-eat bar". One bar, a little over an ounce, is 140 calories, thirty of which are fat. Even though there are more fattening bars you could eat, it still has an excessive-sounding 140 mg of sodium. I only tried the "Frosted Strawberry" variation because it was part of a free promotional package I received from Amazon to promote their new non-perishable grocery line. I think I'll just stick with a granola bar if I get the kind of munchies this bar is targeted to satisfy
This bowl is extremely cute but it does not suction to the high chair.  I can get it to suction to the counter and my glass table but not on my baby's highchair, so it really doesn't serve the purpose it is suppose to
A MUST HAVE !!..Well,you can live without it,but if you don't mind spending $20-$25 bucks for a skt. holder,this is the one.Well made,versatile,and it does what its supposed to....HOLD the sockets in place.Magnets make it handy as a shirt pocket
This foundation provides a flawless finish and natural look, while also giving a good coverage.  I've been using this foundation for years, all year long, and it is one of my favorites.  Not too heavy and not too light, it's the perfect foundation.   ---  --- Being Asian American and with a light complexion, finding a good color match had always been a problem unless I spent $40 for a bottle of makeup.  Zhen is one of the best deals around - clean but stylish packaging with a superior product inside
Wow is all there is to say no problems with it perfect for a casual picture take
Well, this is the expansion for Settlers of Catan, and a lot of things have changed. The ability to build military forces adds depth to the game, as does the city improvements. The abundance of new cards is worth it if for the beautiful illustrations alone. The expansion makes the game a little bit longer to play, but it still should finish out well inside two and a half hours. My only complaint is that in several games, the Barbarians have not beaten us once, they are way too easy. However, this is minor and can be remedied with a house rule of your own. All in all, this makes a great game TOTALLY AWESOME
Great product, has more features then just CD/DVD burning, system backup, numerous audio recording, editing features, lightscribe and it's also Vista compatible. The only downside is it's learning curve some features and options are complex, but once mastered you will be more then pleased with this product. 
Thin cloth...aweful insulation factor,,,,does not look good on me..
this watch changes the background color from red to black, is great and the leather belt is soft but resisitance
These days, classic game shows aren't really as popular as reality shows like Survivor and American Idol. However, with the surprise Summer show, Game Show Marathon in CBS, many clssics had the opportunity to breathe a glimpse of new life, like Press Your Luck, Match Game, and Card Sharks. Another classic which was revised, Let's Make A Deal. With Monty Hall's benchmark into pop culture revisted, many have wondered whether the classic game of trading will ever come back onto television again. Thankfully, those who easily own DVD actually don't have to wait for the show to return. They can just trade in the comforts of their own living room. ---  --- The Let's Make A Deal DVD game, recaptures the classic trading that Monty Hall made popular from the 70's and 80's into a great fun game. In this game, Monty Hall puts traders to the test where you can trade your chances for big nostalgic prizes like classic cars from Datsun, and Cadillac, to trips and fur coats from Dicker & Dicker of Beverly Hills. On top of that, there are classic quick deals to play for extra cash. For example, if you have a pair of scissors, Monty will give you $700. Also, there are the classic booby prizes, Zonks!!! Although they are fun to receive, you get absolutely nothing to show for it. There is also the anticipation of getting the Big Deal for big bucks. Unlike DVD editions of shows like Family Feud and The Price Is Right, the game really delivers a great job from Monty, and each of the great concepts from the classic game show. The mastering really thrives with classic clips of Carol Merill and Deal's announcer Jay Stewart on each of the prizes. ---  --- Although I just wish there could've been more games to play, I am absolutely impressed with the way Let's Make A Deal was put into a DVD game. If you haven't seen this classic game show, Monty Hall hosted, you have to buy this great game. I absolutely recommend this, and that is definitely not a zonk! ---  --- Price: B 1/2- ---  --- DVD Mastering: A- ---  --- Fun & Enjoyment: B 1/2+ ---  --- Overall: B
This is a beuatiful dining set.  True, it doesn't come with the pony as it clearly states in the product description, but we have too many already.  Anyway, I would recommend it for the crystal princess castle or you can even use this with other doll houses
I bought this battery in July 2004. I charged it as soon as I got it. I put it in the camera and then used the camera about 10 days later. The battery was dead. So I charged it again and put it in the camera again. I used it and it seemed to work fine. But the next time I went to use the camera (Approximately 2 weeks to a month later.) it was dead again. As I write this review I am sitting in a hotel room in Prague. I charged the battery ten days ago. I used it once 7 days ago and took approximately 15 to 20 pictures(Did not use the flash). I then used it again today. I was able to get another 15 to 20 pictures before it went dead( Did not use the flash). I bought the lithium rechargeable battery because they have the longest life and no memory. So now I have to charge the battery everytime I use the camera. This was a big disappointment. I get better life out of the standard Duracell alkalines. It appears that this technology hasn't been perfected or that Belkin has not perfected their quality control. Beware when buying this product
I was pleasantly surprised that this product had pop-top lids. The chicken is packed in water, but not soupy. It was a pretty good buy, because I also bought another product and got a $10 discount on my $49 purchase.  ---  --- I actually bought this chicken to mix with my dogs' dry food from time to time. I was buying canned dog food, but it stank and I was finding shards of chicken bone in it. After reading about dog food ingredients on Paul Newman's "Newman's Own" website, I switched to his dry food. I have to mail order it, so I don't buy his canned food. ---  --- Despite the fact I bought it for the dogs, I did try a can of this myself. It was better than I expected. I was afraid it would have a funny taste to it from the can, but it didn't. It has an expiration date of 9 months from my purchase date. ---  --- The cats liked it, too, so I'm sure I'll be buying it again
Does anyone know whether this set will become available on SACD or DVD Audio format?  How would you contact GRP records to ask? I only give it four stars until multichannel format appears.
one of the most comfy chairs i own. just delightful to sit outside on the patio. i love my chair.  in fact i've got two. i can't say anything more then these are beautiful relaxing comfy chairs
I've been using Cross pens since I returned to my fountain pen roots several years ago but I decided to try this model because of its gorgeous design.  There are aspects of it that I like better.  The cartridges are longer, unlike the smaller Cross ones that run out much quicker and never seem to drain completely.  It was also ready to go as soon as the cartridge was inserted unlike the Cross which seem to be stubborn to get started.  It has a nice feel to it ergonomically and I nice feel to the nib on the paper. 
I just finished up my first bag of this coffee, it's great. I normally buy Starbucks Breakfast Blend, just so you know for comparisons purpose- --- but I am switching to this brand. It's just the perfect blend for me, smooth but strong enough to wake me up.
It's a pretty fun game.  It doesn't have a whole lot of songs, maybe around 30-40, but the ones that it does have are fun to sing and are songs that generally a lot of people know, or would be willing to learn.  There are also several different modes to play in, so you can play the game over and over and never get tired of it.  Perhaps one of the best features is that up to 8 people can play without any extra expansion packs or controllers; all you need is one controller and the USB headset and you just pass it around for everyone to play. ---  --- I agree with everyone else, though, when they say the headset is very flimsy.  I originally was going to get a separate headset but bought the package deal.  Bad idea.  You practically have to eat the thing to sing, and it IS small and will get caught in long hair.  Plus, you don't get the fun karaoke experience.  My advice: buy the game separately, then get the handheld mic.  As soon as I get some more money I'm gonna get the handheld mic myself, it picks your voice up better. ---  --- Overall, a good buy!  And lots of fun, especially if you have a lot of outgoing, un-self-conscious people
Normally the prices on here are competative but I agree they're off base here --- Deep Disciunt DVD is over $100.00 less for  this set and free shipping --- C'mon Amazo
Absolutely no trouble installing on 2 computers,(I use Windows XP)!! Total Protection, plus you can block many websites very easy, which is great for the computer the kids use. Came with 3 licenses
Home Business Magazine is a publication aimed at those members of the general populace who either already own a home based business or who have an active interest in the subject and would like to pursue it further. This magazine contains articles relating to all facets of home business ownership from the initial setup all the way through to the payment of taxes at year end.  ---  --- I read several different business magazines and many of them have to do with entrepreneurship. Home Business is the only one I read that is specifically devoted to starting a business in the home and, unfortunately, it has many flaws that prevent it from being the enjoyable and informative read that it otherwise could be. Probably the most annoying feature of this magazine is the articles themselves and their tendency to be written in a list- type format rather than in a user- friendly way. I realize that people like lists but Home Business takes this a little too far. It makes the magazine seem callous and unfriendly- something you would consult in the same way you would an almanac. For example, it is common to find a one page article with a title like "Effective Ways to Design a Newspaper Ad", or "How to Obtain Quick Financing". In each instance, these articles will have a short opening consisting of a paragraph or two followed by a numbered listing of different methods/suggestions to solve the problem or answer the question. This makes the magazine read more like a reference guide than a piece of reading material.  ---  --- Another thing that is annoying about this magazine is the endless advertising. Not only does it get out of hand, it also includes all sorts of ads that emphasize money- making schemes and other similar material. Advertisements with titles like "Really Lazy Guy's Incredible Little Secret Idea Can Make You Rich", "Free $9.95 Report Shows You How to Make a Fortune", and "Six Figures in Six Months" clutter the pages of this magazine with get- rich quick garbage that everyone knows is unlikely to return even the cost of the introductory package.  ---  --- Some parts of this magazine are more bearable than others and it's this handful of positive attributes that prevent me from giving this magazine a one- star rating. I like some of the success stories because they depict ordinary people who have succeeded at making a living with a home- based business. But even here, the stories are inconsistent. Some are educational in nature while others have little valuable information to share. And to make matters worse, they are far too short- usually covering only one- half page each with a large advertisement taking up the space at the bottom of each page.  ---  --- Speaking of the advertising, this magazine wrote the book on advertisement excess. Advertisements cover about 75 percent of the pages in each issue and it is rare to see even two pages in a row without some sort of advertisement. The ads are posted everywhere, often right in the middle of an article, and they distract greatly from the already limited enjoyment of the magazine.  ---  --- This magazine is assembled together in such a way that it reads like a collection of articles taken from people in different parts of the country that were shuffled around and published in one magazine. In other words, this magazine has no continuity to it. It's like taking short articles from different business newspapers around the USA and then piecing them together into one magazine.  ---  --- Starting a home- based business is a goal that many people set for themselves and there is always a need for some good, timely information when you find yourself in this situation. Home Business, unfortunately, doesn't perform its mission very well. If you dig deeply enough you can find a few good articles. But the majority is too impersonal and too shallow (not to mention smothered in advertisements) to make this magazine worth the trouble. 
I have every single (that I know of) Math Blaster game out there. My kids love them all. I saw this one and couldn't resist buying it. My 12, 10, and 7 year-olds all play this version. (It's too simple for the 12 year old, but he plays as a reward for piano practice - so I'm not too concerned about his refreshing earlier math skills.) My thought it to have each child play the grade level above theirs, and that's ususally right where they're at. Yes, there are a few annoying glitches in the way some of the characters can and cannot move around (I don't play them myself to know well) but I would hope that children are not so whiny that it matters too much. I think every family should have Math Blaster Geometry, Algebra, and all grade levels. If you can make math fun, and use it as a POSITIVE REWARD...that is called a "win win"! :
My husband is an in between size in waist and these new jeans allow that little extra umph that he needs to be able to be comfortable in his clothing.  We love them.  I gave him two pair for Christmas and he had me to order two more pair recently...seems he has decided to throw out the old ones and replace with these.  They look great too
The controller range is less than 40 feet.  This car is much too fast for the short range.  It is very easy to outrun the contoller.  There is also a delay between control input and vehicle response.  All batteries were new and fully charged, checked with a meter.  A scanner verified that nothing was causing frequency interference.  The older Tyco turbo cars had a 100 foot controller range and no delay.  Tyco apparently changed the design to the new digital control to allow multiple cars to run at the same time
Sony continues to exhibit the highest quality in their product design and manufacturing process. This case is very slim, compact, well made, and has a very luxurious feel to it. It completely enhances the look and attractiveness of the Sony camera it is designed to hold
I have straight hair, and this products makes my hair insanely smooth and beautiful...the smell is strong, but I like it, though everyone won't.  Use very little of the restorative treatment, or your hair will be very oily
I am extremely dissapointed with this new edition of the text and have one advise only: If you own 2nd ed., do not indulge in this new edition for even the errors (spellings for one) are xeroxed onto the new edition. ---  --- Therefore, for a review of the text itself, you may, without any compunction, refer to 2nd ed.'s comments, of which there are many
I didn't use mine for the first two weeks of my daughter's life because it was waaaaaaaaaaaaay too complicated! I figured it out, sort of, but to this day when I push the diaper in the film rips. Then when it comes time to change the film, the top doesn't cut the film so I have to use scissors. My sister-in-law told me to register for it. Why did I listen to her! --- Don't buy it! Dont register for it! It's not worth it! I want a refund
We subscribed to this magazine for our 7 year old.  Our 3 and 5 year olds like it as well.  We all enjoy sitting down together to read it as soon as it comes in the mail.  I enjoy flipping through it myself.  You're never to old to learn fun facts about nature!!  A perfect gift
the film is pretty lightweight on a whole but it has a nice charm with a well known Hollywood cliche in film making.I applaud the effort.the chicks in this Film are Happening Babes Fo SHO.but there ain't much to the Film but it has some fun to it
I was looking forward to get the massager, which I was for a while searching. But I regret to inform you that I could use this item for only 2 times @ 15 minutes. After the it didn't work. (the light on the adapter do not work) I'm glad that I can express this.
This book is pure fiction, nothing more. The problem is that is presented as fact - albeit little known fact. ---  --- I won't repeat the good points made by some of the other reviewers, except to say that I also concur with the criticisms of the book.  ---  --- It makes for difficult reading.  It really is not worth the effort, as you will not have any worthwhile information in the end. In fact, if you are a historian or scholar, stay away from it
I haven't worn pierced earrings in years;I thought they were sealed. When I discovered that they were indeed open, I sought some simple gold post types to wear. When I saw my March birthstone set in a simple gold setting, I couldn't resist it. The actual earring is so elegant! 'Tis exactly as described, and more! Wearing such graceful simplicity in my beauty-starved lobes makes me feel like royalty! And for such a small price with the security of Amazon! --- What a joy!  --- Sincerely, --- Miss Agnes Crosb
Almost useless! Tried it for several days of photo shoots and finally gave up in frustration. Went back to using the viewfinder without this magnifier. --- Professional medical photographer
i just recently bought this pistol and am very proud of it and i was wondering if the lighter .12G bb's will damage the gun because on shorty's  [...]  it says only use .2 can you guys help me out
I didn't like them, too sweet and sticky. My dog likes them, though. These just didn't do it for me.
I would agree with the translator that Imitation of Christ ranks very close to the Bible. I read it over and over. It is shocking clear and concise. It forces you to examine your conscience and admit that you are a sinner and encourages you not to be afraid to carry your cross and aim, yes, to be a saint. ---  --- Thomas a Kempis's words cut to the heart and ring true over and over. In the normal state of human depravity, deception, duplicity, relativism, and excuse-making no one could write such a book without a transcendant, almighty, omniscient, omnipresent and infinitely merciful Lord. ---  --- Each chapter feeds the hungry and thirsty soul and feeds the fire to seek our Lord more and more. ---  --- I wait patiently for your return Lord Jesus for your judgement and the new heavan and earth
We haven't had any problems cleaning this chair--occasionally we need to use the crevice tool on the vacuum, but that is simple enough.  Most of the time, we simple take a wet paper towel or wet wipe and run it around the seat sides.  (We'd do that with any high chair.) The tray doesn't fit in our dishwasher, but that too has been easy to clean in the sink.   ---  --- We love the neutral and plain color of the oatmeal vinyl.  Our daughter is very happy in her chair.  She is only 16 months, but very big for her age she has no problems fitting in this seat at all.   ---  --- Our only complaint is that we have to push the tray release handle in when we put the tray on in order to lock it into place or else our daughter can push the tray almost out.  that may be a defect on ours rather than a design flaw--we just live with it since it isn't that big a deal. 
I have used a lot of software, but I do not remember using much that is as difficult to use or learn than Quickbooks.  I have learned it over time, but there seem to be several functions in it that could be done in fewer steps.  I would not upgrade unless I absolutely had to.  The program is usable, but I am not interested in investing a lot more money in it.  It works for my small business, but I could still probably get by with Quicken, as I do not write checks on it.  I do kind of wish I had stayed with Quicken.  The most annoying thing about the program was that I was going credit card data downloads in Quicken, but when I changed to Quickbooks, it would not let me download data from my Quicken credit card, it wanted me to switch to a Quickbooks credit card, or ask permission of all my credit card providers.  I appreciate the security, but since both programs are made by the same company, this just seemed like a scam
My boyfriend always got ingrown hair on his neck, and he was very skeptical about using this. Now he  doesn't get any ingrown hairs and he doesn't pick at them anymore.  He will not live without it now, and we both recommend it!
It is, in my opinion, the second best Anne book! Its Anne's wedding! The whole thing is soaked in romance! Leslie's story is so amazing and sweet that you have to love her. Captain Jim is so sweet and perfect, you can nearly see him. Miss Cornelia is funny and Susan is great. Anne has to deal with tragedy and joy that makes the books so wonderful. The only thing I don't like, is that i wish Marrilla and all the Avonlea people would be in it a little more. In my opinion, this should be where the series ends
I purchased this seat because of the safety factor that Consumer Reports reported on.  In comparing the seat to Graco Snugride, however, I am very disappointed on the tough, very dense foam on the low back/sacral region of the seat.  The foam goes down to a certain point on baby's low back, and then disappears, leaving a dip for baby's buttocks.  Just imagine sitting in a recliner with support only down to the low-back region (with buttocks not supported) ...not comfortable.  I wonder how a baby's backside would stand up to a traumatic jolt in that seat...well, I'm not going to take any chances.   Baby Trend should have consulted a Physical Therapist (like me) before designing this seat.  
I tried to listen to samples of the songs and you have them all wrong. I click on one song and get another from on the list. What gives anyway
Grand old movie, well acted, will watch many times agai
I have used Synmatec products for many years and have been fairly pleased by them.  However, don't buy the upgrade or renew your subscription until AFTER your current subscription runs out because Synmatec will not give you credit for the un-used portion of your previous subscription.  I asked and they said "no way".  That aspect of "customer service" is very disappointing
Someone told me to look on Amazon to locate this product. It's great as a broth but also for gravy and jazzing up beef and poultry entrees'. The taste is OUT OF THIS WORLD and so easy to make. I inject the turkey broth into the turkey before cooking and it enhances the flavor... added bonus since the holidays are just around the corner.  Thank you for having this product on Amazon
For anybody, who wish to learn about the Orthodox Church, and Christianity in general for that matter, this book is "must-read".
I love the bag for all the reasons others did not like it.  The product is listed as a gadget bag and that is what it is good at.  The S2 IS is a large camera for a point and shoot and it fits in very few bags.  This bag fit the camera easily and had space for all types of extras including batteries, chargers and extra media cards.  There is also enough room for another small digital camera or a film point and shoot.   ---  --- The correct way to advertise this case would have been for up to two bodies or four small lens.  Given that limitation, this is a great bag. ---  --- The bag is very well made and holds my Canon Powershot S2 IS very securely.  I lay the camera on it's back and that means that even if I accidently power it on the lens opens harmlessly.  The material is great and the waist belt is very practical.  The strap is well padded and after a day of use I believe it is one of the most comfortable straps I have used.   ---  --- Buy this bag for the correct camera and you will be very happy with it.   
We bought this salt in the south of France where it is available in every supermarket. It is crunchy and delicious. It has been consistently rated as the number one gourmet salt.  Sprinkle on anything and your meal will be transformed. Yum
Even if you don't know much about Donny Hathaway, this collection of songs is a fun mix and it's very moving.  It includes some classics with Roberta Flack that are terrific.  I enjoy it tremendously
The Pixel Chix 2 Story House was suppose to intertwine with other Pixel Chix products - I had bought my granddaughter the car that you were suppose to hook up to the house so that the person could come out of the house and get into the car and vise versa - did not work - returned this item
It's October 8th, 2006.  The Detroit Tigers have just defeated the New York Yankees to advance to the American League Championship Series.   People counted the Tigers out.  Everyone thought the Yankees would walk into Comerica Ballpark and put a serious damper on the success the Tigers have produced all season long.  Nope.  Didn't happen.  The Tigers won 95 games this year.  No one thought the Tigers advancing this far was possible, but when you have excellent stars such as Magglio Ordonez, Curtis Granderson, Ivan Rodriguez, Marcus Thames, Craig Monroe and Kenny Rogers, you can't lose.  The manager Jim Leyland also played a major part in helping to reshape the Tigers as a team, and give them much-needed direction.  He was probably the main reason they won so many games.   ---  --- The Tigers are now a team EVERYONE can love- not just Detroit fans.  TV stations are now playing Tigers games again and reminding people that yes, the Tigers are still around.  The fact that the Tigers haven't been mentioned for the last 10 years shows that the fans may have forgotten all about the team, but beating the Yankees last night was solid proof the team is back, and threatening.  Proof that the Tigers can hang with the big boys.   ---  --- The celebration after the final out in game 4 was wonderful.  Everyone on the team lifted Jim Leyland on their shoulders and proudly walked around the field, while the fans celebrated and cheered indicating they still remember those successful championship years a long time ago, and obviously still support their home team.  It got extremely crazy when the team decided to spray champagne at the audience, and they enjoyed it!  Even a cop wanted to be sprayed.  The celebration supposedly lasted an hour.   ---  --- This Vintage Crest T-Shirt should PROUDLY be worn by you.  I want you to take a trip to New York City wearing this shirt and walk down the street so everyone can see how much of a proud, loyal Detroit Tigers fan you are.  The days of watching them lose game after game are finally over.  Long live the Tigers.  Make sure you buy this shirt to celebrate the wonderful run the Tigers had in the season of 2006.  You need to wear Orange if you live in the Detroit area. 
Absolutely no power whatsoever. If you have true back or shoulder pain you are better off with a hand massage or standing under the shower. No power at all in this machine.
FM transmitters of this size don't last forever. That is a fact I accept but I had hoped it would last longer than 2 weeks. I bought my first one from Target before a road trip in a uhaul without a cd player. The sound was marginal at best and by the end of the three day drive to Oregon it was extremely noisy. I plugged it in to my computer to transmit some streaming stations and it had trouble hitting the receiver (direct line of sight) no more than 40 feet away. Two more days and it crackled its last and died. I exchanged the transmitter at Target for a new one and a week and a half later I was returning that one as well. Spend a few extra bucks, save yourself the hassle and get a Belkin.
I love this toothbrush, its easy and it really imporoves your gum health
I am a huge Thomas Hardy fan, and I was not disappointed with this book. At first all the technical astronomical information was slow, but the love story started and that was forgotten. My only complaint about Two on a Tower is the ending. It seems very rushed - everything comes crashing together in about 10 pages. It wasn't realistic for Viviette to age so much and no longer be beautiful 4 years later, considering she was only 33 at the end of the story. Sir Constantine was possessive, jealous and terrifying but she still kept her health and beauty after suffering with him. The bishop was full of himself - how is that worse? A few years with him and all of a sudden she's an old woman with a heart condition? Swithin comes back and says he'll marry her, she's overcome with joy and BOOM! She dies in his arms. I also find it strange that neither Swithin or Viviette acknowledged that the boy was his. Didn't people in the village realize who he looked like, since people were already suspicious of the lovers? What will happen next, Swithin takes his son in and marries Tabitha Lark? A very good, sad, complicated romance
A passionate home cook that has been honing her cooking skills for the last 25 years, concentrating on Italian cooking for the last 10 years, writes this review.  My favorite cookbooks are "The Professional Chef" by the Culinary Institute and "Culinary Artistry".  With more than 500 cookbooks in my collection I am typically disappointed by food magazines. ---  --- If you like watching America's Test Kitchen you will love this magazine.   The editors cover equipment reviews, cookbooks, develop new recipes in their test kitchen and pass along reader's tips.  If you love to cook, give this magazine a chance.  I think this magazine is better than the original that it emulated. ---  --- In the June 2006 issue this magazine features the following articles: ---  --- Weeknight Grilling --- Rich, Fudgy Brownies Two Ways --- Make Room for Basil --- A Shortcut to Juicy Chicken --- Chopped Salads --- Making the Best Quesadillas --- Cuisine:  Vietnam --- Berry Tarts ---  --- For those cooks that like to make everything, they even include a recipe for homemade tortilla shells (a foreign process to those of use without Latino heritage). ---  --- The editors include an easy to use recipe index in the front of the magazine that is segmented by type of recipe (appetizers, meat & poultry, desserts, etc.). ---  --- In short I have enjoyed every issue of this magazine that I have read.  I would highly recommend this magazine to anyone that is serious about cooking or eating.
Product performs per specifications and is easy to use.  Would like to see fuse easier to replace
When mated to a Sony wide-angle lens, the on-camera flash becomes partially blocked causing a dark area in the photo. A major flaw in my opinion. ---  --- Sony makes no mention of this on the packaging
Good grief.  Where do I begin?  We upgraded two computers from 6.0 to ACT 2007.  Prior to the install, we totally reformatted our hardrives and did a clean install of Windows XP.  We performed an XP update, installed MS Office and basically had two smokin' clean machines - more or less brand new.  Then we we installed ACT! 2007 expecting perfection. Our problems with the software have been: ---  --- 1) Miserable, buggy installation - barely worked. ---  --- 2) Inability to convert our old ACT 6.0 e-mail database into the new version of ACT 2007.  ---   --- 3) Slow, slow, sloooowwww performance. ---  --- 4) e-mails will delete themselves for no apparant reason.  This is the worst of all. ---  --- 5) Terrible syncing with the Palm.  Sometimes it works, other times it doesn't, overwrites data when it is not supposed to and vice-versa. ---  --- 5) Useless Sage tech support. ---  --- Don't buy this product.  In fact, I would never buy another product from Sage ever again.  My colleague has already ditched ACT! and switched to using the Palm Desktop and Outlook Express.  This was after losing all his e-mails.  If I lose all my e-mails again - I will uninstall and ditch my copy altogether. ---  --- I would love to reclaim the hours of my life lost to this poorly written loser of a program.
The ideas for the bottles interchanging is great. But unfortunately the nipples cause too much gas.  When they're using the bottle, you can hear constant air sucking in around their lips.  Every time my little girl uses them, it seems as though she just can't get comfortable with them.    I would recommend Dr.Brown's or Playtex VentAire bottles over any of these.  ---  --- Ultimately, the convenience and features aren't worth the massive amount of gas the avent bottles cause
I was surprised at what a good size this rug was.  It matches the bedding perfect.  The only negative thing I can say about it, is that it tends to scoot around a little bit when you walk on it.  I put it right in front of my son's crib and by the end of the day half of it seems to have scooted under the crib.  It could probably use some kind of gripping material underneath it to keep it in place
How come all the fun is for Chubby Bunnies like WHOLE milk? Don't skimmy girls have more fun? Then what about SKIM milk? ---  --- Why not 128 fluid ounces of Tuscan WHOLE milk, instead of SKIM milk? To get the full benefits of milk's yummy yummy eternal goodness, I'll let these experts tell you why. ---  --- "Less is more." Mies van de Rohe. ---  --- "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler." - Albert Einstein ---  --- "The absent are always in the wrong." - John Bull ---  --- "My illness is due to my doctor's insistence that I drink milk, a whitish fluid they force down helpless babies." - W.C. Fields ---  --- "Things are seldom what they seem, / Skim milk masquerades as cream." - William Gilbert ---  --- "Two percent black; that's like skim milk." - Own Smith
Like others, I was very pleased (initially) with the very quick installation of this router.  Since I am very familiar with Linksys products, working through the web utility to configure the router is a snap.  I was up an running inside 5 minutes.   Signal strength was awesome, and I had an iMac connected wirelessly with WPA security and an XP machine connected through the ethernet port.   Life was good......... ---  --- After a few days of blissful surfing, I tried to connect a Mac PowerBook pro to the network.   Bad idea -- would not connect unless the wireless security was turned off completely (another bad idea.)  After resetting the router a few times it made the whole system very unstable.   The iMac now loses it's connection every 15 minutes or so.   ---  --- Soooooo, once again I'm resigned to spending fruitless hours on a tech support line to a faraway land.   I purposely stayed with 802.11g because this technology is several years old and SHOULD be rock solid.  I found a forum at [...] that proved to me that many others are having DHCP problems with these routers.   ---  --- There's no excuse for having to spend this much time setting up a very simple network!  If I hadn't already tossed the box, I would be returning it for a refund. --- 
This remote is so hard to use and setup. The Xpress functions don't work properly and when used switches to different inputs each time. Most of the interaction with the remote is done on the touch screen so you have to look for the buttons, instead of being able to memorize their locations with your fingers. Get something else
The construction is shoddy, very bad quality leather, made in China. ---  --- My phone (Cingular 8525) would not even fit in it. ---  --- The design itself seemed awkward. ---  --- It went straight back to the Boxwave
While the book covers some interesting aspects of mid and high model rocketry, it is not as comprehensive as other books and dated given the advances in the hobby of the past years.  If you are looking for a book to complement your model rocketry library, this will be a useful addition.  If you are looking to take the step from basic model rocketry into mid or high power model rocketry, there are other books that better describe "how to". 
I had bought this before as a snack at the store and i love the combination of the beef and the white cheddar.  I figure i would try to buy it bulk instead of paying $2 a pack at the store.  However, I'm not sure if it was stored too long in the warehouse or if it was too hot in the warehouse, but the cheese was disgusting!  it was dry and crumbly and had this awful taste.  I even opened a second and third pack to see if it was a fluke, but all of the packages were like this.  The beef stick was good, however, if i had to order again, i'd order the product without the cheese.  It just was not fresh.  (and yes, i did check the expiration date and it wasn't expired
I love trying out new products for my hair and also happen to have slightly thinning hair on the top of my head (with receding corners).  After seeing this set at Sephora I tried it for a week and found the results mediocre.  ---  --- My hair, which is thin and not very abundant, did feel slightly thicker and had a plump look at the roots (especially the crown) but I am sensitive to smell and didn't like the man's cologne like scent.  The shampoo lathers up nicely but the conditioner is dense and doesn't spread well over the hair.  The mouse is interesting.  It definitely seems to make a difference in volume.  The overnight liquid makes hair a bit messy to sleep in.   ---  --- As is the case with any product, it may work for you but it didn't for me.  I believe in changing the body/hair from the inside out works better than rubbing niacin (vitamin b) topically to the scalp and hair. ---  --- I would recommend you try it.  You can always return it if you're not satisfied
These were on my mom's wishlist, so I bought them.  They just arrived and I'm totally disappointed.  I'd return them if it wouldn't cost me and I wasn't so lazy.   ---  --- They look pretty darn cheap, for starters.  Also, they came in a little, plastic zipper bag inside of a little, pseudo-velour bag, with a price tag for $3.30 on it. ---  --- Save your money.  It's best not to buy jewlery sight unseen
I love this Adobe product.  It works very well for me - only a couple of minor glitches - it keeps asking me to re-register - but that's only a minor annoyance.  Overall it is a very good product

I really like this peel.  It is very easy to use and I have noticed a difference in my skin.  It is clearer and the redness and discoloration is fading.  I even noticed my clogged pores are diminishing.  I recommend this peel to anyone.  I have very sensitive skin and it did not cause irritation.  I use this one about twice a week. ---  --- I also recommend the microdelivery vitamin C peel.  That one I use once a week. ---  --- Jennife
This bench went together quickly.  All the parts fit well and the instructions were decent.  Anyone with a simple set of tools and about a hour can handle it with no problems.  There are a few steps where a second set of hands help.  Craftsmenship of the parts themselves seems to be pretty decent. ---  --- However, this bench is simply not built for much weight.  It will wobble and flex.  It doesn't feel safe at all.  If you are serious about lifting you will quickly out grow the weight capacity of this bench.   ---  --- There are alot better benches out there for just a little more money
This cable did not fit my camera as stated.  Because of the cost factor, I chose not to return it.  The shipping was more than the cable was worth
I bought this after fidning my 2nd child who is 4 months old caught under the headboard bumper that came with his bedding.  This is my 2nd child & I have never been told of this danger.  I highly recommend this bumper.  It comes in 2 pieces, the shorter one goes across the front railing that you move up & down, the longer piece goes from the last slat on the headboard to the last slat on the footboard.  There are only 2 gaps which are where the handles for the railing are.  I was also able to weave a few places along the sides to make sure he couldnt get underneath.  I love that it's wide so that it reaches down to the mattress, it velcros at each end across both the top & bottom for a tight fit, it will collapse if an older baby tries to step on it but is still very tight & that it's very breathable but still has a little cushion to it. --- I just wish that I had known of the danger of traditional crib bumpers.  Thankfully I heard my son screaming when I did.  HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT, or one like it to avoid suffocation hazard from stuffed bumpers
The performances for every sonata and every partita are wonderful. This is the kind of material one can expect from Deutsche Grammophon. Wonderful music, a wonderful violinist, wonderful interpretations, and wonderful sound (not just for its time). There are also very few "squeaks" and he is almost always right on pitch! Often called definitive, this is the one to get. Highly recommended
I've had a subscription to PC World over the past few years (as a gift) and I love it.  The articles are very insightful and relevant.  I can always find at least one article in each magazine that helps me with a computer issue I'm having at the time or provides me with reviews on electronic devices that I'm looking to buy
It was awful! The reproduction of the music was grainy, scratchy and virtually impossible to listen to
I burned my hand, but it was ok. I got to keep 3 of my fingers. They work fine, but they're a bit too hot
This cd has alot of tight hits including: Nann by Trick Daddy and Who Dat' by J.T. Money. There are too many good songs to name for this cd, those are the biggest I like and I like all the others too. I can practically just  listen to the whole cd without stopping it, which usually never happens  with other cd's b/c u buy it for about 3 good songs and all the other songs  are junk. But this cd has all the Hip Hop Hits that it proclaims. I suggest  anyone looking at this review or cd, to buy the cd. It's worth it,  definetely!  One last word is that you will have no regrets buying this cd  at all I think in my own opinion.I am from St. Louie and I am telling ya'll  to look out for a new group called NELLY also, there hit single is already  out "Country Grammar" and cd soon to be out. Get that when it  comes out to. Peace out ya'll
I love House Beautiful!  It gives so many wonderful ideas.  This is a collection of ecclectic styles, patterns, and methods that will suit anyone's taste.  And these ideas aren't hard to follow.  With the smallest effort, anyone can follow the look they have in the magazine
Loaded easily, no glitches. the online account access feature became functional after running the software update. ---  The program is fully functional and I have suffered no inconvenience running this on an Intel-based Macbook.
The mouse itself is very nicely designed and cool looking. I use it with my Apple Mac G5. The optical tracking is great, no moving parts. The scroll wheel is indispensable for browsing the web and scrolling through documents. I just wish the software that comes with it would be more stable, less buggy. I had to uninstall it and use another mouse driver with more options, functions and less bugs
I had to repurchase this product, because my first one broke, the hinge that they use to attach the battery door to is pathetic, seriously a design flaw. However, with some Epoxy glue and a different type of hinge you can modify the origional product to be something better. In this case you really get what you pay for... Its dirt cheap plastic and it breaks easily. I wouldnt recommend getting this unless you need something dirt cheap and only plan on using it a few times.
Peter Balakian's book, "Black Dog of Fate," tries to be too many things --- and sadly fails at many of them. In essence, it is an attempt to tell a  --- sort of Armenian-American story which I find not overly interesting or ---  compelling. I wish the author had done a bit more in-depth work to learn  --- about his people and their rich heritage before embarking to represent it --- or explain it or share it with non-Armenians, for he has much more to absorb --- and understand himself first. I find the Armenianness in this book to be  --- tentative, unengaged and unconvincing. Pity, since the author seems to  --- have a lot of passion in his pursuit of other aspects of his life such as  --- football, the Yankees, modern poetry, and exposing Turkish attempts to --- buy (among others) Princeton professors to act as mouthpieces giving --- legitimacy to their vile historical revisionism, practiced by the  --- "modern" Turkish state and its organs. ---  --- It seems to be all the rage these days to elevate personal histories and  --- family testimonials into the realm of fiction and novels. The "I" and "we"  --- and "us" occupy center stage and the reader is invited to enjoy the  --- intimacy that must surely be in place via this artifice. But is it realy? --- Since in order to make this legitimate, the writer must distance himself, --- at least initially, from all this old world exotica, and like the reader, --- question their validity or relevance in present day North American  --- society. What are all these old world, old fashioned ghosts and traditions?,  --- is the first cry of writer and reader alike, only, ofcourse, to be followed  --- by a sharp bank turn where the writer steers the satisfied and in-place --- reader towards the opposite viewpoint wherein *this* culture and *this* --- lifestyle become suspect in light of some tentative spotting of cultural  --- wealth that has been traded in or abandoned in order to swim swiftly towards  --- materialistic, memory-free, self-redefining, "comfort" seeking and buying  --- mores. ---  --- In the Balakian tale, one encounters suburbia instead of substance,  --- worldly goods acquisition instead of deep roots that steady the soul,  --- immediate family and relatives running away from their true identities either --- towards surrealism, the abstract and unemotional, or else towards medicine, --- respectability and detachment. Young Balakian observes but never --- understands "the grandmother" for she is shielded culturally from being --- able to reach him by her very offsprings who can not and will not instill --- the Armenian identity he will eventually seek but never quite find. Their --- crime is self-denial and a march to the tune of America's mixmaster --- piper. "Be unlike your past and your future will be brighter," seems to be  --- what America promises, at the very least. The intermediate generation listens --- and adopts this credo and Peter is left to find out but never quite --- understand just what cost his ancestors have paid to remain Armenian and --- to preserve our culture before the final denials on New Jersey pateos while --- enjoying, as if to serve sweet irony, full course Armenian meals and the --- mixing aromas of delicacies from the old country every Sunday. ---  --- Peter is lost alright, but as the book sadly shows, he remains lost. --- Paraphrasing or quoting Ambassador Morgenthau does not an Armenian genocide --- expert make. Personal family testimonials of the Turkish atrocities does --- not a genocide history make (For that, read Vahakn Dadrian's "The History  --- of the Armenian Genocide"  Berghahn Books, 1995). Episodic accounts can be  --- dismissed by the Turks as hear-say and as mere isolated incidents, leading  --- to more harm than good (for if better evidence existed, the arguement  --- goes, why would anyone resort to such flimsy fare?). For the story to have --- worked, for the story to have *really* worked, as I would have liked it to, --- Balakian's life and lifestyle would have had to have changed --- significantly and his child rearing practices would have had to reflect  --- it, and his relationship with his wife who, like him, is not leading a strongly --- Armenian existence, would have had to have changed, solidifying his roots, --- celebrating his new found identity, and nurturing the metamorphosis by --- sustained community involvment and grass roots movement participation --- which, alas, never appear on the pages of this book. How else to explain --- the lack of a turning around of the tide of assimilation to which Balakian --- is a grand personal witness, except that the transition has not occured? --- The ship of Armenianness sails by Balakian. He is finally aware enough to --- be able to identify the ship and wave it goodbye and write about it, but --- not resolved enough to climb aboard. That is how the book fails and that is --- how his story fails. This is a story of assimilation and loss with a bit of --- mid stream self awareness thrown in. For a real story of an Armenian --- finding his roots and letting them take root in his own life and future, --- read Mark Arax's book, "In my Father's Name (Simon & Schuster, 1996)," --- where the transition is real and the early youth of disaffection is --- replaced by a profound adoption of our essence revealed in exquisite --- frankness and power by Mark Arax. One can only hope that Balakian's --- partial reorientation towards our culture and traditions and essence will  --- somehow continue and that some day he will wish to live with a more meaningful --- attachment to our cause and needs than merely as an able observer (not --- withstanding his laudible actions as an April 24th -- Armenian genocide --- commemoration speaker and an exposer of Turkish infiltration in the US --- academic arena by buying spokesmen turned professors who mascarade as --- unbiased researchers). This criticism I direct to the predecessor of this --- genre of American Armenian writing first and to Balakian second. I speak --- here of "passage to Ararat" by Michael Arlen (Hungry Mind republication, --- 1996) where a disinterested soit-disant Armenian goes to Armenia in the --- 70's and by the end of the short trip is somewhat more closely touched by --- this strange people's woes and dreams. Too little, too late, and always --- detached, is all I can say to these meagre displays of ethnic or cultural --- reorientation. Much more needs to be absorbed before the essence is --- transmitted to future generations to take and behold. ---  --- However, I remain hopeful that future transformatory stories and ethnic --- identity survival stories *will be* written which will show that the tide --- of assimilation and cultural abandonment are not the only outcome of this --- experiment of transplanting peoples and cultures to this continent we --- proudly call our home
Well, I just tried the Bundle Me (toddler size) with my 20-month old in our jog stroller for the first time today and I am disappointed because it is definitely already too small. He really can't sit in the bag unless his legs are bent, which he hates. Plus, when I have the bag pulled as far down as possible in the stroller (the only way I can get him in at all), then it only zips to just above his waist -- definitely not high enough to really get warm and snuggly. ---  --- I'll keep the bag for baby #2, but I'm really disappointed I can't use it with my not quite 2-year old.
When we first got the stroller, it pulled to the left significantly, but we got on the phone with Tike Tech and they were extremely helpful and accomodating. The stoller works great now.  I have taken it running with my two girls - it is very stable and drives smoothly
I expected something better from Godiva Chocolatier. ---  --- I am a big fan of both chocolates and coffe, but ---  --- Godiva seems to be making coffee that tastes like something ---  --- in between vanilla and chocolate. ---  --- I could endure chocolate creme and vanilla hazelnut, but  ---  --- this creme brulee coffee is just awful. ---  --- Godiva has to focus on their chocolates. ---  --- True coffee-lovers/connoisseurs will hate this coffee
I've had this camera for about 1 1/2 years now and it's been a tried and true companion.  I've easily taken over 10,000 shots with it and produced some really exceptional photographs.  The features that really set this camera apart are the 12X zoom, the image stabilization (a must with such a large zoom), and the rotating screen (great if you want to take a picture of yourself :)).  I also love the macro mode, I've gotten some great quality close-ups.  For most situations you can just stick it in auto mode and get great results, but the different scene modes are fun to play with as well.  Performs extremely well outdoors -- wildlife, sports, landscape, beach, etc.  ---  --- My only real complaint is its performance in low-light situations.  Pictures are grainy and the camera is very slow to respond, sometimes not responding at all.  Also it can eat through batteries fairly quickly -- regular AA batteries lasted me about 2.5 hours of continuous shooting (around 200 pictures) or less if I was shooting in cold weather.  I would definately recommend rechargable batteries. ---  --- Overall I've really enjoyed this camera.  I've used and abused it and apart from low-light situations (which I was rarely in anyway) it never let me down.  Both my grandmother and my great aunt bought one within the past 6 months and they rave about it
I love Glamour!  This has to be my favorite magazine of all times!  Granted the ads drive me nuts but I love the Do and Don'ts and all the clothes.  I am a shopping mogul!   This magazine is great for showing new trends and I love layering and almost always they are showing new ways of layering clothes and teaching you how to wear your clothes in a different exciting way.  I also enjoy the articles and life lessons as there is always something that I am interested in.  I read Glamour almost from cover to back!  I rarely skip articles!  If you like fashion and just articles on every life issues this magazine is for you! ---  --- **I have noticed a change over the last year in the magazine, but it is not terrible.*
Made in 1959, Douglas Sirk's Imitation of Life is still just as evocative and as gorgeous to look today as it was almost 50 years ago. It's a real cinematic treat, shameless tearjerker, and an unabashed melodrama that dares to confront head-on issues of racism and the problems of motherhood at the stage when one's teenagers - in this case daughters--are growing up and preparing to enter the world. ---  --- Lana Turner has never looked more ravishing as Lora Meredith, a young New York widow who will do anything to realize her dreams of Broadway stardom. Together with her young daughter Susie, they live in a squalid apartment eking out a hand-to-mouth existence, their futures fuelled by unfulfilled dreams.  ---  --- One day at Coney Island, Lora and Susie meet another a white girl Sarah Jane, who is being taken care of by a black woman, Annie Johnson (Juanita Moore), whom Lora mistakes for the maid.  When told by her that she's the mother, the surprised Lora falters but then accepts it without a question as if it were a natural thing that a black woman has a white child.  ---  --- The angelic and virtuous Annie asks Lora if she can come and help out around the apartment. Lora is initially hesitant - not because of Annie's race but because she's struggling and doesn't have any money to pay her a wage. Eventually, however, she relents and tells Annie that her and her daughter can stay for one night.  ---  --- At the same time, Lora meets the extremely fine-looking wannabe photographer, Steve Archer (John Gavin). Steve takes an instant liking to Lora and offers to marry her. But Lora is far too concerned with realizing her acting dreams to be stifled by a man and by marriage. Meanwhile, the saintly Annie is troubled that her daughter is ashamed of being black and tries to pass herself off in school as white. ---  --- Imitation of Life follows these characters throughout their lives, with Sirk piling on the sentiment and melodrama every chance he can get.  Lora does indeed become a famous Broadway actress, yet neglects her growing daughter in the process. Steve goes on to become a president of a large photographic organization, but has trouble relating to Lora's need to be independent and famous.  ---  --- Annie's heart is eventually broken, gradually worn down by years of emotional abuse from her daughter. Sara Jane is so angry at being labeled as black that she repudiates her mother and ultimately runs away. Annie always stays the subservient and loyal maid; whilst her best friend and employer goes on to bask in a lush and international success. The contrast of the mother's compensations from their conflicting daughters is the story's ultimate paradox. ---  --- Lora, Annie, Steve and the two girls seem to be victims of each other. They all want to follow their own dreams and forge their own paths in life even when it doesn't seem to be doing them much good. They are also surprisingly oblivious of how manipulated they are by the world around them.  ---  --- Lora gets her career but she's unlucky in love and terminally insecure as a mother, Whilst Sara Jane - perhaps the most damaged character - achieves her ambition to pass herself off as a white girl, but at great personal cost to both her and her aging mother.  ---  --- Under Douglas Sirk's accomplished direction, Miss Turner et al acts ornately and elaborately, everything is over emphasized to within an inch of its life, especially Lana's gorgeous outfits, yet the film - clocking in at over two hours - is always compelling and is never boring.  ---  --- The screenplay is sophisticated, the themes are brave and tempting and the look of the film - the brilliant surfaces, audacious colors, and the spatial complexities of 50s moderne architecture - bring to the forefront a bittersweet world of fantasy, entrapment, and emotional anxiety, and where the price of following one's dreams eventually comes at a harsh and desultory cost. Mike Leonard June 06. 
There are enough reviews of the main movie story so I don't need to add anything in that regard.  But, what on earth does a lesbian sub-story (in both regards) have to do with the story as a whole?  Nothing.  So, we have another movie that would be great to introduce the whole family to blue-grass music and the Appalachian way of life that, instead, heads for the trash bin
Reincarnate can be a hard shampoo to get used to, especially if you're not already using LUSH products. It doesn't 'sud up' much, and feels a little bit muddy and grainy. Don't fret though! It will certainly clean your hair, and will also leave it smelling like wonderful spices (almost as good as "Arabian Bright"). The highlights are not something that come with one or two washings, but with many many washings, and they are /very/ subtle but there. The only reason I don't give this product five stars is that it was not as conditioning as it states it is, and I needed to use another conditioning product with it
We ordered this case/auto mount for our Philips PET710 7" Widescreen Portable DVD Player because it was the one recommended by Amazon.  I needed the auto mount for long car rides with my toddler.  I eventually got this thing to work (failure was not an option if you get my drift), but it has a number of drawbacks. ---  --- -In order to mount it, you have to remove the top half(huh?).  Having two parts makes it harder to install and easier to lose.  I accidentally left the top part on the top of the car when I drove away. ---  --- -It's too small.  The Philips portable DVD player is too long for the case and the headphones and car/ac converters also pull the player out of the case.  Plus (and this is really amazing), it does not have enough space to hold the most basic accessories that came with the DVD player.  I have to carry the headphones and sleaved DVDs seperately! ---  --- I chose my last DVD player b/c it came with an auto mount case, and even though I like the Philips DVD player, I'd do that again if I had it to do over.  Having the right case/mount for your DVD player is that key
I know it takes eight weeks and maybe longer but I do appreciate the information that I've gained from store bought "Maximum PC" magazines.  I don't build computers but when I do order one, it is nice to be familier with the workings and attributes of the new computer. --- Yes... you can find much information on-line and generally faster than the amount of time it takes for the magazine to reach your mailbox, however, is great to kick back away from the computer in your favorite chair and 'read' about it :) --- A very good magazine... but 'adult' language used at times does not appear to me as professional use of the english language. --- Thus the 4 rather than five stars
This is one of the best semi-futuristic movie ever.  And for all you Shadowrun lovers out there this movie has the same type of erie-ness and finess to it.  By far Keanu Reeves' best performance to date
great shirt for working out in. Clears away all the sweat and is loose fitting
Though I was daunted a little by the reviews stating problem with installing the game I went for it and I don't regret. I bought the Platinum Edition and it installs all right. The good thing about the platinum edition is that you get three games at the same time.  ---        Would not say it's one of the very bests available in its category but it's interesting and fun. About graphics, though the details are not great, still I liked the 3-D view, specially the view through the eyes of the main character(Hero). ---        Story is so so. Dialogs are specially bad. But the fact that you have to follow certain clues and talk to people and find out useful information is good idea. A sort of combination of RPG and RTS. ---              I like the units and the way they fight. Also picking up artifacts or weapons is good.  ---         Overall it's a nice game. And the platinum edition is specially good as you get lots of hours of gameplay
I use the extension cable that came with the adapter to extend the GPS-360 device further down the dashboard. This adapter apparently can't sustain the weight of its own extension cable leaning against the clear plastic cradle. I've only used it twice - first time, it snapped off the back half of the cradle and the second time finished off the front half. The connector sticking out of the adapter still works with the cable, but I'm going to try and super glue the cradle back together before using it again. I don't want the connector to snap off next
when it comes to buying camcorders, i personally like the one with the build in memory. but after using this camcorder i was forced to change my mind.  --- unlike other sony camcorders, first of all, it offers upto 40x zoom which is a lot. its a good use of your money. you can have it for under $400 and still works better than a lot of choices out there. easy to use, touch screen, takes still photos, has a good speaker so it's easier to record video and voice, fits into your palm so to speak, and if you use rewritable mini dvds, you wouldn't have to worry about go out of memory.  ---  so when it comes to sony camcorders, i would say the better quality of this one would get the job done properly.
His basic thesis is that a liberal empire can be a greatly positive force in the world, and that the United States is already an empire, but that our inablility to acknowledge the fact leads us to waste our opportunities to be the afore mentioned positive force. Ferguson writes that America is plagued by an attention deficit disorder and too much love of the good life. Thus, we get distracted too easily from important events overseas, and when we do try to intervene, we want quick fixes and low costs. ---  --- I couldn't agree more with most of these points. As an American, I'm greatly ashamed of our collective ignorance. I hate feeling like a foreigner in my our country because I watch the news or can find Sumatra on a map. Also, the book strikes a chord with me because of my frustration with half measures in foreign interventions. Countless times, I believe America has done more harm than good by, if you will, talking the talk but not walking the walk. If we commit to something, we need to follow through. This is as true in Iraq today as it has been in the past. We've claimed to support democracy in Latin America, but then turned bannana republics into bannana autocracies. We greatly prolonged and increased Vietnam's suffering without changing the end result at all. ---  --- With all this commonality, however, there are a few leaps of logic that Ferguson makes that I can't bring myself to agree with. Basically, he didn't sell me on the thought that the imperial model is the best way to develop the world. How are we supposed to know what is best for everyone? Won't our own biases and self interests inevitably distort even our most altruistic efforts? ---  --- When Ferguson hold's up the British Empire as a model of success, I can't help but notice that the best results came only to those places of British colonization, with horrendous consequences for each of the native populations there. And the two greatest examples of beneficial American imperialism - Japan and Germany - were already highly developed before World War II, so it probably wasn't that much of a wonder that we were able to help them return to such a state. ---  --- Even if the positive power of empire is conceded, there are important differences between the state of world during the British empire and the state of the world now. It's a concern of immunity from repercussions. In the golden age of imperialism, Europe was in a kind of splendid isolation from its empires. Not to say that there were no reprercussions, but, with the only modern navies in the world, Europe was immune to any very serious threats. On the other hand, in today's world, as an effect of globalization, power has become more decentralized in some respects. Think WMDs,terrorists, and foreign investments in the U.S. economy, for example. Can America as easily afford to make enemies in the developing world as the British could? ---  --- In the end "Colossus" didn't settle any agruments for me, but raised new and interesting questions. It is a book that makes you think, and that in and of itself is worth four stars.
This item is not as functional as I thought.  I miscalculated the size which is not big enough for my purpose.  Also, the brittle like surface is cracking and peeling off. I was going to exchange or return the item but the packaging was discarded too soon
I purchased these shoes as a Christmas gift for my husband.  He's been wearing it a lot.  He says it's comfortable, and he has not experienced the squeeking from the shoes as some other reviews had pointed out.  I was hoping it has more of a dressier look.  It really looks better with jeans and not as good with kahki's
Up to you, but I would buy a generic branded battery of the same type (Lithium BP522).  I bought a generic battery and it works just as well -- saved me $50 
The Lands End 60/40 Oxford is THE dress shirt to own!  It is the end of the line in your search for an excellent product!  I buy nothing but this shirt, and have multiple shirts in each color made.  I've worn a shirt and tie nearly every day since I was 16 years old in prep school (35 years now), and the Lands End is the best.  I highly recommend this shirt
The shipping for this product cost more than the product itself.  It was packaged in a medium sized box and would have fit easily into a small padded envelope. 
This game is a great way to pass twenty to thirty minutes.  It is very easy to learn and does not have any pieces to lose, or money to count.  The strategies, however, are numerous, and there is an equal amount of luck as skill involved in good gameplay. ---  --- I really liked how the game could ONLY be played with two people, as I was tired of games that COULD be played with two, but which were really meant to be enjoyed by three or more... ---  --- Game Contents: 1 deck of game cards, and one small board.  Note: If you want to make this game really portable you don't even need to bring the board.  It is just a place to put discarded cards and a way to help organize your cards.  As long as you have a pencil and paper for scoring at the end of the game, you can play it everywhere that you have a table.  (I figure you need as much space to lay down your cards as the size of a typical Monopoly board). ---  --- Playing Note: One thing that was initially a little confusing to us when we were reading the instructions, was that the instructions do not explain that you are to place your cards on the opposite side of the board as your opponent.  You can each play all 5 expeditions, in a head to head manner.  We were sitting on a couch at a coffee table, and we had turned the board horizontally to face us (instead of vertically) and the instructions were confusing until we moved the board 90 degrees.  The game designers assumed that you would play the game as one would play a game of checkers, sitting across from one another, but you don't actually have to play this way, even though you DO need to turn your board for the same effect. ---  --- This game is really fun and I would highly recommend other games from the same manufacturer (Rio Grande Games).  They really have a knack for publishing great strategy games.  They even release expansion sets to their popular games, and they credit the players who gave them the ideas for the expansion cards.  Pretty neat
When I got this product out of the box (I hadn't seen one in a store before), I was surprised by how lightweight and cheaply made it appeared, particularly at the price they charged (about $80 at the time).  The box I received was also missing the insert for the iPod nano, and the nano won't sit securely in the iPod socket without it.  I returned this product, and for about the same price, I got a much more solid--and better sounding--boom box with an auxiliary input jack that allows me to play songs from my nano (though admittedly without the remote that allows you to scroll through your iPod songs).  This wouldn't be a bad iPod speaker set if you could get it for $20, but at $80 it's dramatically overpriced
Still have not received an issue yet. Please give me an update as to when the first one will arrive
I bought a 3 user Zone Alarm Suite for far less than Zone Alarm offered for a single user upgrade. It pays to shop around, and Amazon is often where it all winds up
This paper offers a wonderful broad perspective, and great national coverage. Doesn't take too long, but always has plenty to read. Every american should read this paper. And every adult should check out the "New Sex Now" dvd
I love this magazine,it is my favorite of all of the scrapbook magazines out on the market.  It has an all-around appeal with great and creative ideas, ways to delve into your creative mind, tips and tricks, and of course beautiful layouts to look at. This would make a great gift for a beginner or advanced scrapper.
I never received this magazine so how would I be able to rate it??  I cant even find a way to let them know I never received it
I've been wearing Philosophy's Falling in Love as a regular fragrance and liked it so much that I decided to give some of their other products a try... Pure Grace has been a lovely find! I spray a little on a blouse or jacket and have that lovely fresh-washed scent lingering all day. It compliments the Falling in Love scent nicely, as both are fairly light, but I love it on its own as a nice change of pace as well. So far it has been just as advertised-- clean, soapy and crisp-- and I'd add that it's just one of the most comforting smells around... makes me want to curl up in a pile of warm towels fresh from the dryer and take a little nap
I have been in the housekeeping business for six years. I ran out of my stainless cleaner today and used my clients. It is the best I have seen there is absolutely no effort to apply this product and the results are fantastic. Two thumbs up for sprayway stainless steel polish. You have my business from now on
I picked this up because it's considered a classic and I knew it had been made into a movie.  I tend to think that if a book is made into a movie, then the book must be pretty good.  Not so with Howard's End.  The plot in Howard's End doesn't progress much outside of an early death and later marraige.  You have to have some interest in the characters, but they just weren't very believeable.  None of characters convinced me that they could be people from the real world.  I kept waiting for someone to say anything that might border on being interesting, but everyone babbles on and on about nothing of any substance.  The story is clearly dated and doesn't hold up well so many years later.  Living in today's world, it's hard to understand what attracted Margaret to Henry.  There definately is an audience for this book.  I'm just not a part of it
I purchsed this video a few years ago and was also very disappointed. I have nothing more to add to the other reviews posted here; just to agree that the sound was poor and the viewing quite fuzzy. I remember watching not only the first broadcast on NBC but several broadcasts years after that, with different casts. It was and still is my favorite Christmas story. I will certainly purchase the Schippers CD and hope to see another video or DVD in the future
I'm going to start this review by saying that I came to the Wii as a lifetime PC-only gamer. I have never felt the need to buy a console until the Wii and its fun controller system came out. The aspect I was most excited about was controlling first person shooters just as precisely and intuitively as the mouse and keyboard, together with the added entertainment of using it for other motion-activated actions within the game (rowing, throwing grenades, close combat, etc). As a result, after spending the night out in the cold to get my console, and flushed with excitement at seeing all the merchandise, I grabbed three games: Zelda (a no-brainer), Trauma Center, and Call of Duty 3. Of those three titles, I'm sorry to say that CoD 3 was the one to leave a bitter taste in my mouth.   ---  --- As I have stated before, I am a PC gamer; I'm really into my hobby, and love the satisfaction of building a PC which can manage all the latest games. I played CoD 1 and 2 on the PC, and greatly enjoyed both. By far the biggest problem with the Wii version, however, especially as someone accustomed to playing on the computer, are the graphical shortcomings of the title. I literally had no idea what was going on. I could barely tell which direction the enemies were coming from and the only reason why I was going in the right direction was because of the linear construction of most of the levels. Added to this, I had no idea how to get rid of the first German to engage me in hand to hand combat (a much advertised feature, which is actually just an interactive cut-scene). I followed the instructions to wave my controllers around wildly, and although I worked myself into a frenzy (causing my dogs to panic and think something really was attacking me) that inevitable German (I tried throwing all my grenades into the room he hides in) kept clubbing me to death. Even beyond this setback, I found that the controls were often quite poorly implemented. It is also disappointing (yet speaks volumes) that the grenade 'throwing' function that involves you actually 'throwing' the nunchuck (without letting go, by the way, unless you've got a backup TV) is disabled by default; trying to use it usually gets you to miss your target/get cut down/ blow yourself up. For the record, I know that the Wii controller works. I've played many hours of other games already (as the system conveniently informs you). This just seems like a shoddy implementation of it. ---  --- I can definitely tell you that there is a lot of ambition here to convey the frenzy of war, with some obvious strong attempts at creating absorbing combat scenes. Nevertheless, it essentially boils down to being a messy soup of blurry pixels which, even to my gameplay-over-graphics mentality in buying the Wii, blocks the enjoyability of this title. To be honest, it has made me think that WW2 isn't the best-suited area for the Wii. After all, these historical titles tend to rely a great deal on cinematically portraying the visceral splendor of war, rather then pushing exciting new gameplay elements. My advice on the FPS front: wait for the Wii 'Far Cry' game and see how that turns out. In the meantime, there are countless hours of other great titles more suited to the Wii graphics waiting for your attention.  ---  --- Before leaving you, I'd just like to clarify on thing: this is the perspective of someone who has very little experience with consoles. Perhaps you're reaction to the game will be very different if you come to the Wii straight from a gamecube instead of PC/high definition gaming. ---  --- Oh, and if you're still determined to buy it, keep an eye out for my used copy of the game; I'm going to need the money for 'Banana Blitz'..
this album had two good songs at the most. ralph was good with new edition. it's apparently obvious that he can't stand alone. bobby should have been the lead for new edition. then we may never have seen this terrible album. ralph isn't that good of a singer. this shows that just because your the lead singer in a group doesn't mean you are the best. ralph is miles behind bobby

I like this product a lot. My hair type is curly and frizzy specially after the hair gets dried up naturally after the head bath. I used this product and my hair looks good now. It looks smooth and straight now and I can feel the softness when I touch my hair. I definitely will recommend this product to my friends.....
We had to move it about our place in a few different windows before we found one that actually got the radio waves (and we know our directionals here).  So, if you get it, just be patient and leave it overnight in a few different places before you give up
LONG TIME LOYAL COSMOPOLITAN READER RATES 5 STARS ---  ---  ---  --- I've read COSMOPOLITAN and HELEN GURLEY BROWN since the 60's and never miss a month.  Along with skads of other magazines I enjoy, Cosmopolitan manages to have some fun fashion, fun & hip dating articles, fiction and true stories, and lots of quick reading ideas.  I've never thought of it as a "health" magazine as another reviewer thought of..it's been an iconic reading for the EARLY SEX in the CITY set.   ---  ---  ---  --- "Sex and the Single Girl" by Helen Gurley Brown was a breakthough book in its day, letting women in the 60's know that it's perfectly okay to chose career and other paths in life than the one society forced on the women in that day.   ---  ---  --- Cosmopolitan has been the singles bible that confirms that it is okay to be single and thriving and adventurous in your life.   I can see where this would irk men that want to REPRESS women, --- or WOMEN that have subdued to their REPRESSION, but if that's not you...then keep the COSMOPLITAN's coming.  Catch up on some great women and what they're doing.  Educate yourself on women's health issues, --- Find out what men like...a few tricks..check out the fashion, new make up tricks, and new products, and never stop learning. ---  ---  --- Personally, I plan to read it forever.  There's something for everyone in it.  And it has inspired me for decades. --- Thank you, Cosmopolitan
I really enjoyed this coloring book--as in my very early yrs., I had kaleidoscopes to play with.  I was always intriqued with the color spectrum in them.I was hoping to find more on line with the illustrator of this book.  Sadly disappointed.  Will keep looking at other book sites. By the way, I am 56 yrs. old--and I love to color.  It's wonderful therapy for relaxing and bringing back some childhood fun
I must say I enjoyed the book, but the ending was so sudden, with so many things left hanging, that I was disappointed.  I wish one more chapter had been written to clear up- how did Manderly catch fire, what did they do when they got to the burning house, and how did they pick up their lives. All we had at the ending was ashes. Also, the narrator, who never gives her name, was sometimes very odd- hiding behind doors in her own home, sneaking food, hiding behind chairs. The book is worth reading, but I wish that, instead of spending so much time describing the trees and the sea, Du Maurier had written a better ending.
I was really disappointed with this entry even though Jason Takes Manhattan isn't much better! The DVD treatment is way to good for this film. If you want to complete the Friday series it should be seen as it does set up for the Freddy VS Jason movie.
Just wanted to let others know this info that I found out after reading the tip given by the reviewer about getting the table for a lot cheaper at Costco ... ---  --- I called Costco and they carried the KIDKRAFT art table with two stools back in January of 2006, and will no longer be carrying it.  You can find it at Walmart for $66 plus shipping, just check the website.  The table is not the same however -- the dimensions are different, the sides of the tables is slightly different (on one side of the Kidcraft table has two cups and a mesh basket in between the two cups, and the other side has a space where little legos can snap onto).  The stools are also tiny compared to the ones that come with this table. Overall it looks a little less substantial, but since I haven't seen it in person, I really can't give my opinion. ---  --- Hope that helps someone
Why do some people call Bratz dolls 'sluts/slutz'? Are you guys mad? They are just dolls. They are made of plastics. So what they wear SHORT mini skirt? They just DOLLS. If you hated mini skirt soooo much, well don't wear them. --- I saw many teenage celebs wear mini skirts. --- THEY ARE JUST DOLLS, okay? No need to argue if they wear short mini skirts.  --- Anyway, about this doll I am totally adore her. She is very pretty and very ROCKSTAR material (I don't know how 2 spell.I don't care about her having tatoos. Lot of celeb got tatoos and she's a rockstar material.
I can hardly express in words how I feel about these bears.  Haribo Gold-Bears are absolutely charming.  They're a little taste of heaven.  I like them frozen
I have tried many different wiper blades on both my car and my wifes. I thought I take a chance on these after reading some of the reviews. All I got to say now is, WOW! These blades are whisper quiet and clean the glass so well I am very impressed. We had an overnight sprinkle and when I got into the truck the next day the spots were all dry, a few quick wipes with the washer fluid, and it was almost crystal clear!! 5 year warranty, these have to be the best blades out there!
Well, nice cinematography as set-designer work: nicely interiors and well dressed actors. Maybe, visually it is enough to keep you watching this movie once, but not enough to consider it as a remarkable  movie of year, as other reviewers trying to assure
This is why sony is hot! This sexy little (yes its really small the size of a pack of cards) it takes perfect clear and crisp pictures and the battery life is a long 320mins perfect for a vacation, make sure to get a memory stick with it though, because w/o it it only holds about 15 pics. This is my first digital camera and I would definitely buy sony again
I love this movie as I have seen it many times.  Audie Murphy did a great job in playing himself, although it must have been really hard to relive. ---  --- A movie that I would highly recommend.
I had an Amazon reward certificate and was looking for something practical to use it on.  It so happened that I needed new tweezers.  I read the reviews and thought I'd give these a try.  Wow, I can't believe the difference in quality from any other tweezers I have ever owned.  They almost seem to adhere to whatever your are trying to grasp.  It is so easy to precisely and almost painlessly remove even the finest eyebrow hair.  Tweezerman Tweezers ROCK!
wow this scope goes great with the UTG Master Sniper. It works very well when you tune it in
Same thing happened to me as the person from the previous review.  They sent a pink pillow instead of the crib set, and will not honor the same price for the bedding set.  I have to send it back and they will give a refund.  What a hassle
I just recently bought this game for about $10 dollars.  I had always heard is was awsome but had never even played an xbox(I've been a PS2 fan for a while).  After I played the first couple of levels I was not dissapointed.  This game is simply amazing even today, I can't possibly imagine how good it must have seemed back when it came out.  The gameplay is terrific, and so are the graphics.  The sound and music to the game is awsome.  I highly recommend that this game is bought and not just rented because it is well worth owning
Avobenzone 2.0% , Homosalate 15.0% , Octinoxate 7.5% , Octisalate 5.0
This is hands down the best star wars game i have played or seen. Just the fact that you can use almost every hero and villian in the star wars movies makes this a blast to play. The addition of the space combat is what really tips the scales on this title. When you're flying through waves of tie fighters and you land on an Imperial star destroyer and begin fighting through control rooms, you begin to realize this game is really special.
My daughter is 2 1/2 years old and I often find myself surrounded by some loud toys that jingle or sing.  After dinner I find that this book is a wonderful transition into our bedtime routine.  She has learned how to button, use a zipper and problem solve by using this book.  Also, I find that this is a great toy to keep in the car when rush hour traffic becomes horrible.  I have bought this book for many of my friends children and would recommend this to anyone who has a toddler since the it holds up extremelly well no matter how hard your child plays with it
It is the declining days of the Great War (WWI), the Germans are leaving a small French town but are leaving a little present for the advancing British troops.  They have buried the munitions in the town square.  When the town hall clerk strikes midnight the bomb will be exploded.  The town's people evacuate.  During this the barber sends off a message to the British. ---  --- The British decide to send a man to check this out.  They choose the bumbling Scottish Private Plumpick (Alan Bates).  Located on the outskirts of town is an asylum.  The sisters who run the asylum escape with the town's people, leaving the inmates to fend for themselves.  They return to the town, resuming their lives before being commited. ---  --- Plumpick arrives in town but doesn't know that the towns people are actually the lunatics from the asylum.  He meets the beautiful Coquelicat (Genevieve Bujold) and falls in love with her.  He finally puts everything together and defuses the bomb (of course it's more complex and hilarious than just that.)  He also finally puts together that there is something wrong with the town's people.  The funny part is he feels the lunatics have a better grasp on reality the sane people.  So shall he return to the war or stay with people he loves. ---  --- This is half fairy tale and half fable.  Alan Bates gives a great performance and Genevieve Bujold shows great whimsy. ---  --- DVD EXTRAS: None
This book helps toddlers put into context how they fit into the animal kingdom, and the natural things all animals do. It teaches them to be comfortable with - without shame - the move from being a diaper-clad baby to a big kid. The drawings are charming! I bought this book for a friends who runs a day care center and got a very positive reaction
Truly this is the magazine of the warmongers, the neocons, who would gladly repopulate America completely with non-Europeans, except for the neocons themselves and their cohorts, who are of  "a race of the mind," as one wag put it, by and large. ---  --- Pro-war and anti-American people (and certainly anti- Euro-American people), this magazine is truly one to be boycotted.  If you are an American of European descent THE AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE will more likely be for you.  If you are racially aware and don't wish to see your people vanish from the Earth, I would also recommend THE OCCIDENTAL QUARTERLY. ---  --- To give the devil his due, TWS does carry some interesting book reviews at times. ---  --- If you love your people, as long as they are not from "the race of the mind," do not buy this magazine, and if you already subscribe do the smart thing and cancel for a refund, as I did a few days ago. ---  --- Highly recommended as antidotes to this warmongering propaganda are two outstanding collections, NEO-CONNED! and NEO-CONNED AGAIN
This was a gift and was lovely and beautiful. Not too big, not to small. Delivery time was great. Strongly advice to buy this
I am very happy with the Emjoi Compact Epilator that I purchased.  It does exactly what it claims to do and works wonderfully. Until I asked a salon for advice on the best way to remove unwanted facial hair, I didn't even know something like this exhisted.  I just wish I would have known about this product years ago. ---  --- A. Davis
I bought this watch because of the stylish looks, the reported reliability, and the fact that it was a watch that would never need batteries.  There were also other functions advertised that appealed to me.  I have owned Casios before and they took extreme wear while still maitaining their function.  This watch I have now will not allow me to go more than five days without the solar battery running out - usually at inopportune times where I really need a watch!  It has become very unpredictable.  Please do not get me wrong, it is a nice watch, I have gotten many favorable comments.  But I want a watch I trust to work day-in, day-out and not one I am constantly worried about.  I guess for someone who has the time to set the thing out in the sun on a regular basis, it would be a good purchase
All of these people complaining about horrible picture quality must have some pretty crappy TV's. ---  --- I mean, it could be that I have a 20-inch Sony Trinitron and the Halo special edition XBOX, too, but.... ---  --- I have had absolutely no problems with it and neither have any of my friends (in real life), or anyone in my CounterStrike Clan (on XBOX Live) that have old TV's and regular XBOXes ---  --- RECCOMENDATION: If the picture is crappy, buy a new TV
I never buy stuff like this on line.  I like to play with/feel wallets before getting them.  But I couldn't find a thin, bi-fold that I liked, so I took a chance. --- It's great.  The ID feature is super handy (it comes all the way out if you're wondering).  And the brown leather is soft and nice.  It is really nice for the price. --- (By the way, personally, I don't think it's thick at all)
Got it for 20 bucks on cyber moday. Easy to configure and use. Nice sound quality. Only con being a loose fit around your ear and has to adjust it constantly to fit correctly
This movie is not a war movie. It is not remotely related to history either. Guadalcanal was not like this as anyone who knows the people who fought there and the history. Since when did American troops in WW II carry pliers around to extract gold teeth from dying enemy soldiers? This depiction is just simple minded and pure excrement. Enemy soldiers all hugging around and teary eyed over war is hell? Can we spell Bushido? Mallick can't.  ---  --- Now, if you like touchy, feely, not the real world aesthetique, have at it. The scenery and photography is quite good. 
HAD TO SEND BACK THE FIRST PAIR BECAUSE I NEEDED A BIGGER SIZE. RECEIVED THE SECOND PAIR AND CREDIT FOR THE FIRST PAIR PROMPTLY. THIS PAIR IS JUST RIGHT!!! WILL DEFINATELY --- ORDER AGAIN. THANKS
I have owned a pair of these boots for three years now and they are still going strong. I work in construction and find these to comfortable boots whether I am on site, at home, out on the town, etc. These are really incredibly made considering their 40 dollar price tag
good shaver lots of battery life quick charge lots of trim setting and gives a good uniform cu
I bought this camera to replace my 35 almost a couple years back.  I am an avid nature photographer so most of my work is taken in the outdoors.  After hundreds of pictures and all kinds of weather here's the lowdown... ---  --- Pros ... Picture quality is amazing even after zooming the full 10X (I never go into digital zoom because of low quality of pictures, although this camera isn't too bad after complete full optical and digital zoom).  Prints that I've made up to 16X20" (haven't gone larger, but I know I can) are extremely impressive and are as crisp as viewing a 4x6.  It is easy to use and the functions are easy to get to with the use of the joystick.  The stabilization at full 10X zoom is incredible also.  It appears really shaky through the window, but pictures continue to turn out crisp.  Close-ups are clear and reveal amazingly clear details.  The movie feature works better indoors than the regular camera portion (read cons). ---  --- Cons ... Indoor shooting is limited because the flash isn't strong enough.  When at a school chorus concert, the pictures turned out fuzzy and unclear.  Award ceremonies, the pictures turned out once again unusable in my standards.  The zoom is fixed when using the movie feature so you need to have the zoom set before beginning a movie.  This camera seems to eat batteries, especially in the winter months.  I am always on the go, and when I go to pull out the camera I find the camera lens cover has fallen off yet again.  It comes off way to easily causing smudges and smears on the lens so I must always have lens cleaner wipes on me.  The viewing window cover has also come off and is lost in the woods somewhere, but that also is minor. ---  --- Most of the cons really are all minor things that don't interfere with the amazing quality of the pictures as long as you are properly prepared for those minor issues.  I tried to be as precise about this camera as possible.  All in all, I would highly recommend this camera to the avid photographer.  If you plan on using a camera on mostly indoor activities, just keep in mind for the flash to work good, keep your subjects close.  It's been bumped, jostled, and droped a couple of times and the camera still works like a gem
I am a coffee afficionado! I'm a pickey coffee drinker and only use a french press to make my coffee from the freshest beans I can find. I keep my coffee beans in the refrigerator and grind them fresh moments before making my daily cup of coffee! This coffee was great and I have tried a million different brands!!! Organic and fair trade is important to me!!! Thanks for the extra effort! I wish the big guys would make this kind of effort!!!
I bought this as a gift for a friend and she loves it.  It is a great color and texture and really like the mesh cut out for breathability.  I think I may order one for myself
I have seen Al Jarreau 20 times in concert (and recently saw Al and George perform at the Hollywood Bowl) and am a long-time fan from WAY BACK. There are a few Al CDs that you just play forwards and backwards (and back when they were cassettes, you wore out the tape) because they're just PERFECT. "Breakin' Away", "Jarreau" and "Heaven and Earth" come to mind. Well, add "Givin' It Up" to that list. If you're an old-school Al fan and you're wondering whether to buy this CD, BUY IT. It will live up to all of your Al expectations. There's a "Look the Rainbow" feel to it, there's a "Breakin' Away" feel to it, there's a "Jarreau" feel to it. There's even a "Glow" feel to it (when you think about tunes like "Milwaukee" and "Have You Seen the Child?"). Grassroots Al. ---  --- It's got the production values of "Heaven and Earth" and "Tenderness". FABULOUS production, arrangements, gathering of talent. There is not one song on here that you will skip as you're listening to it driving to work or whatever. In fact, if you're throwing a party and want to instantly get people in a jazzy party mood, put on this CD because between everybody from Chris Botti to Jill Scott to a SOULFUL Paul McCartney, people will stop and say, "Wow, listen to Jill and George tearing up 'God Bless the Child.'" And "Is that Paul McCartney tearing up 'Bring It on Home to Me'?" [Yes, it is.] Meanwhile, Al and George are working their magic the entire time, and guests will say, "Listen to George right there." And, "Al is jamming right now." It's a conversation-stopper provided by the best thing that can stop a conversation at a party: fabulous music that people must comment on. Of course, that's where the conversation picks right back up, so you win either way. The blend is perfect: Just a touch of scatting, just a touch of voice-beat, with lots of fabulous jazzy vocals by both Al and George, tons of great music solos, and George playing a perfect guitar. ---  --- If you're a George Benson fan, you will be THRILLED with this CD because George provides a fabulous through-line to every piece. He's ever-present with every wonderful thing he ever did on a guitar. He fronts many of the pieces, and he's not in any way relegated to "background guitarist." He IS the music in every piece, with few exceptions. As much as I love Al, this CD is MAGICAL because of the blend of George and Al. ONLY THESE TWO CAN PAIR UP TO MAKE THIS KIND OF CD. There IS NO OTHER TEAM who could have pulled this off. You need Al's voice and George's guitar. Period. In fact, I'm guessing much of the jazz music world is a tad jealous right now of how simply GENIUS this CD is, as in, "Dang. These two are GREAT together. Wow." ---  --- Bottom line: This is a perfect blend of these two greats' talents. George takes care of the music, while Al provides the wide gamut of vocals he's an expert at (and that only he can provide). If you've been a long-time fan of either of these two, you won't be disappointed. It's not lopsided. And it's OLD-SCHOOL in every good way.  ---  --- My prediction: This CD will sweep the Grammys. If it doesn't, there is no justice. Like another reviewer on this page, I intend to buy this CD for about EIGHT people. It's just THAT perfect
I bought this book before my first trip to Austria. I had a  --- sinking feeling while reading it that it was mostly a  --- pastiche of unusable generalizations. That turned out to be --- true. What shall we do with a paragraph that tells us that --- Austrian women are strong-minded and independent and  --- organize their homelife well, although many go to work? ---  --- This book might have some value for a person who had never --- left their english-speaking homeland before and needed to  --- be warned that people are sometimes naked in the sauna --- or at the beach. It also provides some amusing anecdotes --- about language (especially viennese) and useful info about  --- festivals. ---  --- Mostly, though this book was good for reading aloud to --- Austrian friends. I would quote it as an iron-clad  --- authority when their behavior didn't quite match the  --- book's version and thereby amused them tremendously. ---  ---  --- --Lynn Hoffman, author of THE NEW SHORT COURSE IN WINE and --- the forthcoming novel bang BANG from Kunati Books.ISBN --- 978160164000
This clip is great and it doesn't just work on UTG guns it works on smith and wesson shot guns. Any one with a shot gun from UTG or smith and wesson should buy this ---  --- Ps. I'm 1
I realize this isn't an expensive bra, but I expected it to at least FIT! I've never ordered a bra that was sized this crazy! The band was way too big and the cups were way too small. Needless to say I'm returning it. Save your money, ladies! ---  --- On top of that, it took almost a month to receive it because it was out of stock. Even though Figleaves displayed the item as IN STOCK. This is the third time Figleaves has done this for Amazon items. I think I'll skip buying from them in the future
It's not the best grill in the world, but for the price it does the job well enough.  It cooks unevenly.  The front and the back of the grill are hotter than the center. 
The figure was sent back for a replacement because the legs did not fit into the body, it was defective.  The same problem with the replacement and it was returned as well. 
One of the nicest things someone did for me when I lost my husband to leukemia was to send me this book.  The selections are sympathetic and inspiring.  Also, they're short at a time when the mourner really can't concentrate on long selections.  This book has helped me through the most difficult time of my life
I previously wrote a review for this and only gave it 3 stars. But after watching it again, I realized I liked it better (I do agree with the reviewer below me in that it does grow on you). I do not consider all of the performances goth. Martiya Possesion are more tribal than anything(at least on this video) and I really dislike the expression, or lack thereof, on their faces while they are dancing. They either look completely bored, pissed off, or smug. I skip right over it.  ---  --- I also did not care for Asharah's dance to the drum solo by Solace ("Opaque"). The dance mood does not match the mood of the music at all. The music is saying "fast, big, upbeat" and she's standing there doing taxim moves and small quick moves. ---  --- And of course, we all love the S&M piece...excuse me, S&M is NOT part of the Goth subculture, and has no place on a bellydance video. Jehan may be a great and accomplished dancer, but she didn't dance much on this and I didn't want to see what WAS on her part. ---  --- Another thing I would have liked to see is more GOTH music. I like Solace and all, but there were a lot of songs by them on this video and it would have been nice to see some more pieces done to music from the Goth genre. There were a few, but not enough for my liking. ---  --- My favorites on this video were Tempest, Ariellah, Jeniviva and Ayshe (for wierdness factor). For all of its faults, this is a good video to be inspired by and I will use it for that purpose
Monkey Business looks pretty good on DVD 50 years later.  The restoration comparison on the DVD shows the change the restoration brought, a bit darkly tinted, and more defined.  The wild plot keeps you glued to the screen throughout.  Marilyn Monroe who is the star on the DVD box has more of a supporting role here.  She is great as the secretary Lois Laurel who shows up early because the boss doesn't like her punctuation.  Cary Grant as the addled Professor Barnaby Fulton turns in a great journeyman performance, getting appropriately loony when experiencing the euphoria of youth.  His driving sequence with Monroe had me turning in my chair with laughter to avoid the trucks!  Ginger Rogers as wife Edwina gets pretty wacky when returned to youth.  If all youth were as lighthearted as these comedic versions, it'd be a laugh and guffaw every time the school bell rings.  Hugh Marlowe as the straight-laced attorney Hank Entwhistle does a nice job of standing stoic during the crazy Indian game.  Oscar winner Charles Coburn (1943, The More the Merrier) does a great job of appreciating Monroe's assets as Oliver Oxly, the CEO.  Kathleen Freeman as Mrs. Brannigan gives a fine performance. The DVD offers perviews of many Monroe films.  This is a great little piece of cinematic history.  Turn back the clock & enjoy
We bought these because there was an online coupon for them.  My children (ages 11 and 14) take lunches to school and I was looking for something beyond the usual chip choices.  The price was right and with the free shipping when going over $25, it was hard to resist.  The fries are light and airy, like a thin cheeto but with a more delicate flavor.  They are a nice change and we're really enjoying them
Walzer's historical approach to examining just war theory is, I think, the most useful way to understand morality in war. That is so because empirical facts back up all the philosophical evaluations. Walzer describes experience and draws conslusions here; he is laying a philosophical foundation and implying, if not prescribing, moral norms from which the rules have been extracted. Be forewarned, he does not cut the reader any slack. This book requires some serious attention to the author's train of thought.   ---  --- Just war theory has two categories: the justice of going to war, and the justice of fighting once in a war. Walzer's discussion usefully and clearly separates the two and examines via historical events what we regard as right and wrong within each sphere. In doing this he has done the modern world a tremendous service. His logical breakdown speaks to thousands of years of tradition about what thinkers have considered right and wrong in war. One of the best outcomes of this landmark work is the complete debunking of the notion that "all is fair in love and war." That is the path of least moral resistance (or as Clausewitz would say, "friction"), yet we all know that soldiers are honored for fighting well and loathed for behaving like armed thugs and murderers. What is amazing from the discusion is the realization that Walzer knows he has to attack that age-old notion, something our collective sense of justice has historically always rejected.  Yet it remains a prevailing idea for many.  Originally coined by the Romans it seems (Walzer quotes them, "In war the laws are silent"), they themselves were self-consciously contrite over the fates they inflicted on the Greeks and Carthginians.  The book rates five stars for rigorously addressing this issue alone. ---  --- Some make the mistake of thinking Walzer is a pacifist--far from it.  On the otherside some critics find his argument about "supreme emergency" a moral failure and a cop-out.  The case of Nazi Germany is his paradigmatic case of supreme emergency, one where normal rules may be relaxed, if ever so little, because of the especially pernicious nature of state-sponsored genocide.  The same relaxation of restraints would likely apply to Islamic terror. In contrast Walzer does not see Imperial Japan, for instance, as having represented a supreme emergency, and so the atomic bombings and the fire bombings of cities could not be morally justified. Readers may want to compare his view to Paul Fussell's perspective in the essay "Thank God for the Atom Bomb." ---  --- Significantly for current events, readers interested in the distinction between pre-emptive and preventive war will find a well articulated argument here. The US attack on Iraq was and still is often justified as pre-emptive.  That impulse on the part of the neo-conservatives who devised or whipped up the casus belli reflects, I think, a need to cloak a morally questionable war in the robes of legitimacy. There is no way that attack can be justified under the historically accepted norms of "pre-emption." Michael Walzer's well-thought distinction between pre-emption and prevention makes sense even in the milieu of asymmetric warfare against terror and Islamic radicalism, and it clearly shows why the Iraq war was a moral mistake from the start, regardless of its practical success down the road, if we are fortunate enough to see that. The moral precedent of engaging in preventive war will continue to haunt America long into the future. The fact that Iraq was not even on the spectrum where the fine line between pre-emption and prevention exists is a telling aspect of the overall ongoing strategic fiasco.  Where one fails to recognize the moral high ground, one is doomed to moral failure. Walzer was vocal about the run-up to war in 2003, and those who read his book would do well to find his comments about the Iraq invasion; they are edifying in terms of understanding the overall argument and where we are going in this role as the world's police force
I did not get the crossover tube in the box like the picture shows. I had do modify one of the tubes so it would work with my old crossover. Go to weber in the future to get what you need , its worth the extra money
So this movie is made of 2 stories.  The first one is quick and involves Takeshi Kaneshiro and Brigitte Lin.  Both have their stories and I actually found Kaneshiro more interesting.  So this thing ends and the movie should have also.  It should have been a 30 minute movie.  So for the next hour or so we get to watch Tony Leung Chiu Wai sit around his apartment in his nothing but a white tank top and his briefs.  Wow, what a movie.  The only positive to the second story is the girl who listens to the same song all day.  She was fun to watch but I still wish I wouldn't have seen this dumb movie.   
The toy is a lure to a social networking website for little kids.  They play games against "friends", who are strangers on the web.  They "chat", but only with preapproved messages.  There is always a reason to come back to the website tomorrow and play some more. ---  --- I don't think teaching little kids to keep coming back to a website is particularly healthy.  I REALLY don't think teaching them to interact with strangers on the internet is a good lesson, no matter how sanitized the interactions might be on the Webkinz site. 
I just received the gauge and I'm returning it after trying it for 2 minutes: ---  --- - The hose didn't seal well on the tire valve --- - WHen bleeding air, the display didn't update. You have to remove the hose, wait 10 seconds for the display to turn off, then plug it back to the valve stem and get a reading. This is ridiculous. --- - The display is on for 10 seconds and then it turns off itsel
Excellent book - telling a shocking but real story of genocide on an unbelievable scale.

I bought this drive from PCuniverse on Amazon and I am generally happy with the service I received and product quality, I have not used it for long time yet but have managed to fill up most of the drive. The speed looks good even over wireless network. I also like the Truecrypt encryption software bundled which is actually freeware; seems to be quite capable an usable with any drive (USB flash or disk drive, look at [...]It seems much better than the software that comes with many flashdrive in terms of capabilities. I am surprised that there is not a lot of competition in the 8GB flash business yet possibly because people don't need it. I had a Corsair 1GB drive from 2 years back and it worked quite well; upgraded to 8GB as my data requirement grew
From the moment she glimpses her idol on Broadway, Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) strives relentlessly to upstage Margo Channing (Bette Davis).  Cunningly, Eve steals Margo's role, smashes Margo's best friend, Karen Richards' (Celeste Holm) marriage, and becomes the toast of Broadway!  Great performances all around with some of the juiciest, wittiest, and oh so quotable ("Fasten your seatbelts, it's going to be a bumpy night") dialogue ever!  I don't know if the film would have worked as well without the suave and sophisticated performance by George Sanders (Rebecca (1939), he is truly remarkable as the story's narrator and Broadway critic, Addison DeWitt.  This film also marks the screen debut of legendary beauty, Marilyn Monroe, who plays a bit part as Addison's lovely date at Bill's welcome home party.  Even here Marilyn's astonishing screen presence and simmering sensuality (of which she would later ride to fame on) is clearly evident. ---  --- "All About Eve" has been hailed as "One of the smartest pictures of all time....a picture for any era" by the L.A. Times, and Variety put it simply best as "Captivating!"  It's interesting to see Bette Davis and co-starring romantic lead, Gary Merrill (who play's Margo's lover Bill Sampson) play out their scenes together, for in real life they actually marry and similar odds ends their relationship.  It's all told in the included Special Feature, AMC's "Backstory" telling all about "All About Eve."  Anne Baxter and Celeste Holm are featured in the interviews and give some interesting insights on the film and it's "behind the scenes" antics.  Bette Davis and Gary Merrill should also not be missed in the 1952 suspense classic, "Another Man's Poison."  A new dvd release of this picture would be much appreciated, for the current release is discontinued.   ---  --- Also included in the Special Features is the film's Gala Premiere footage / 1951 Academy Award footage, in which "All About Eve" won 1950's Best Picture / Theatrical trailer for "All About Eve," "Gentlemen's Agreement," and "How Green Was My Valley," are also included.   ---  --- If you're a classic movie buff, you don't need to be told anything about "All About Eve," you will have already discovered it a long time ago.  I don't have to tell you how essential it is to add it to your dvd library, for you either have it already or have placed it on order -click "add to cart" NOW!
The camera fits perfectly. The case is very stylish.  Best of all, its Pink
This pasta is very good.  It works great in salads, casseroles or regular pasta dishes.  I've only been gluten free for a few months and I think this tastes very similar to wheat pasta.  Granted, I've only tried one other kind of gluten-free pasta (made all of brown rice) but this pasta is FAR better and I like it enough that I feel no need to keep shopping around and trying other kinds
I sent this to a friend and with free shipping who can beat the price. My mom saw it and said it was wonderful.  I will definitely purchase again
I LOVE Destiny's Child...BUT this CD...big disappointment. The best songs on the entire CD were probably Lose My Breath,Cater 2 U and Girl...big disappointment...i just wasnt feeling the CD when i bought it..
I'm not sure why I never watched "Ghost" before until last night.  For some reason, I didn't pay much heed to it when it was first released and never thought it was worth watching on TV.  I'm glad I gave it a chance because this is a GOOD movie.  What makes it good is its' skillful mixture of suspense, romance, comedy, and the supernatural.  That would seem to be too much to tackle for one movie but we get it all in the right balance.  I was drawn rather quickly into the movie and got to where I couldn't wait to see what was coming next.  There were a few "convenient" capabilities that these ghosts had that were necessary for the story to work.  I'm a rather pragmatic person but, by the time these things came up, I was so caught up in the story that I WANTED these things to be possible.   ---  --- Obviously, the writer and director deserve accolades for their work and the actors do as well.  I wanted to make note of the quality of acting because it was probably the cast that left me uninterested in watching "Ghost".  I was prepared to be unimpressed in particular with Whoopie Goldberg so I want to confess that I thought her Best Supporting Actress Oscar was well-deserved.  I figure that I was one of the last persons in America to see "Ghost" but if there are others of you out there who still haven't seen it, give it a look; it's well worth it
very excited to get an alarm at a good deal with free shipping but that all changed when i tried installing two beeps and then nothing i have spent over an hour of tring to get this to work and i tried new fuses but "no go" to sum it up the two orginal beeps is all i got from this product besides stress. NO GO
This is by far the best design magazine anywhere. The price might be daunting but, beyond being on the bleeding edge content-wise, issues are typically loaded with custom papers, finishes, a fold out poster, postcards, and other generally inspiring material. If you are tired of yuppie design rags and are looking for great work that spans an incredible range (every month), this is it. Not for "8 ways to better drop shadows" types. This is the real deal
The Best of Taste compiles material from their 4 official albums released from 1969-72. The albums consisted of two studio albums "Taste", "On The Boards, and the two live albums "Live Taste", and "Live At The Isle Of Wight".  This band was a power trio led by Rory Gallagher before he disbanded the group to embark on a successful solo career.  The band led by Gallagher on vocals, guitar (electric, acoustic, & slide), harmonica, and alto sax specialized in hard hitting blues rock.  The music has much in common with Cream.  However, the Richard McCracken and John Wilson could not compete with the stellar musicianship of Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker.  The undervalued Gallagher is an unsung guitar hero whose work compares favorably with that of Eric Clapton.  Like Cream the band favored extended versions of tunes like "Sugar Mama" and "I Feel Good" included here.  The music included here is varied.  It ranges from the slow gut wrenching version of "Catfish" to the more acoustic cover of "Leavin' Blues".  The cuts from "On The Boards" become more jazzy at times.  Tracks like "On The Boards" and "It's Happenened Before, It'll Happen Again" highlight the band's more improvisational approach.  Hard hitting tracks like "Eat My Words" spotlight Gallagher's outstanding slide technique.  Two cuts I miss from this period which are not included here are "Dual Carriageway Pain" from "Taste, and "Morning Sun" from "On The Boards".  The live concert favorite "Sinner Boy" provides a bridge to Gallagher's solo career as the studio version was included on his first solo album "Rory Gallagher".  This anthology provides a great overview of the early work of Irish blues-rock guitar hero Rory Gallagher and his battered Stratocaster.  It is even more essential as the four original albums are only available as imports
Jack doesn't pop up after only a few weeks of owning it.  Don't waste your money
I bought the 4600 for my parents in 2005. A seal in the lens housing broke in November and we sent it to Nikon.  When Nikon recieved the camera they said it had "liquid" damage to the lens shutter area. My parents didn't send the camera in that condition, yet Nikon claims that it is "impossible" for that kind of "accident" to occur at their facility. Two months later I am still arguing with them over this. One of their service represatives, Rob Mustard, told me (paraphrasing) "I have 70 service orders in front of me and our facility gets hundreds of repairs each week; I've heard every excuse imaginable for why it isn't the customer's fault." Besides being rude, doesn't that scare you about his facility getting in hundreds of repairs each week???? Don't buy Nikon is my recommendation.
We gave this set to my Dad for Christmas and he was very impressed.  It has plenty of sturdy, all aluminum tools and the case is awesome, too
I love this bottle dryer.  It was a little pricey but worth it! It holds a lot of stuff and is not in the way on the countertop.  I never put bottles, binkies, etc. away anymore.  I just leave them because it is so convienent
Since I had never purchased a watch by Croton, I did not know what to expect.  The watch came in 2 boxes, the first being a black cardboard box detailing the Croton brand in silver on the top center of the lid.  Inside of this box, the watch itself is encased in a nice padded black leather case with the Croton name embossed on the top center of the lid.  On the inside of the lid, there is a "pocket" that stores the instruction guide and a warranty card, which is neatly concealed behind a black piece of material with the Croton logo in silver text.  Needless to say, I will feel good presenting this gift to my boyfriend. ---  --- The watch itself has substance to it.  The shape of the watch face is unique as it looks like a more rounded rectangle. The face is blue, and what is nice is that there is a bit of light texturing on the face.  The blue color seems to change from dark to lighter depending on the lighting in the room.  The numbers are clearly visible, but the date is a bit on the small side, but not terrible.  When I took the watch out of the case, I noticed that it was not running and at first, I feared that the watch battery was dead.  This was not the case however, I found that the watch pin on the side was pulled out, which had stopped the watch.  I am not sure why this was done, perhaps it is done to conserve the watch battery?   ---  --- The back of the watch has the Croton name etched into the center and underneath, it states that it has a sapphire crystal, Japanese quartz movement and the water resistant details. As for the bracelet, it does not seem to be as heavy as I thought it would be, but I will have a better idea after my boyfriend tries it on.  However, I am expecting that he will need to get the watch sized to fit his wrist, but this not at all surprises me as this has been common practice with many of his watches.  As other reviews mention, the instruction booklet is not for this specific watch and is not so helpful.   ---  --- All in all, I think this is a nice watch.  Its design is simple, yet elegant.  I think it will be a good business casual watch, as it can be dressed up for the office, yet be worn after hours and on weekends.  Another nice feature is the fact that it is water resistan
Great phone ... durable and so far dependable.  I did buy a larger battery.  There is one complaint, sometimes the person you call sounds like they are drunk.  I don't know if it is the service or the phone
The pro and cons described by other reviews are valid. I was specifically looking for a boombox that has cassette, mp3, cd and radio capability. So didn't have much of an option but to get this one. I am impressed with the sound quality but agree that there could have been improvements related to interface and some of the functionality. Overall I think its a good buy.
pretty decent utilitarian paddle.  i think this is a better deal than all the other low end paddles out there, since shipping cost was zero
The plot is good but there are about 200 pages too many.  Why a full chapter to tell us what the protagonists are thinking about the attach case, when we already know it was not in the car and we could tell them where it is? We know where the precious document is : another useless quest. People are murdered by the half dozen, the characters are outrageous, most of the time improbable, and I felt the semi-erotic swimming episode totally stupid, not to mention the girl apologizing constantly about it. --- I have read much better books than that. Sorry..
The Belkin TuneTalk is fabuous for using an iPod as a digital recorder. I have had very good results recording various music rehearsals (children's choir to big band) with and without an external powered microphone (Sony ECM-MS908C stereo mic) attached. Since I already had the mic, the total cost was very low compared to purchasing something like a Zoom digital recorder for this type of recording. I haven't plugged it into a mixing board yet. I suspect it would produce an even better recording with a decent pair of mics through a Mackie 1202 or better. ---  --- I bought a USB power adaptor so I wouldn't have to worry about battery drain. It plugs into the TuneTalk and provides power to the iPod. ---  --- No, it isn't as good as a high dollar recorder, dedicated mic-pre's and a pair of Neumann mics. Serious recording requires serious equipment. However, for all those other recordings, the Tunetalk Stereo is a great recording option for about $60 and your trusty iPod.
This three-part television production by the BBC, released in 1999, is one of the finest films you'll see in a while.  The acting is brilliant, especially the performance by Lindsay Duncan, the direction is extraordinary, and the plot is most unusual (if improbable).  The production is flawed only by a weak musical score. ---  --- The real question is: How did this superb film ever get made, in a media devoted to pleasing teenagers and adult sickos?  Don't miss it
This was my first GPS system of any kind.  I wasn't sure what to expect.  I have a small Mazda Miata so I wanted a small-screen GPS that did not overwhelm my small dashboard and this did not disappoint.  I was afraid that the screen would be too small, but it's perfect.  I don't think a bigger screen would do anything more than take up more space.  --- I live in New York City and before putting it in my car I walked with the GPS unit in my hands.  Perhaps because of the tall buildings and the slow walking speed it took more than 30 minutes for it to initially receive a satellite signal.  I was convinced it was defective.  It's not.  Once I put  it on the dash of my car and began driving it acquired a satellite signal within a few minutes. --- This unit comes with a 128Mb Micro SDcard onto which you can load a few state maps at one time.  I ordered a 1Gb Micro SDcard along with this GPS (for approx. $11 on Amazon) and loaded ALL of North America at one time. This eliminates the need to re-load maps when traveling anywhere in the country. It's worth the extra effort. This unit can be quickly moved from one car to another, especially a rental car anywhere in North America.   --- My very first test of this thing was on the very complicated underpasses and overpasses in northern Manhattan and the Bronx.  It was flawless!  It's impossible to get lost with this thing.  Occasionally I've made a turn too early or too late and within seconds it will re-calculate the best route.  The combination of the voice prompts, the highlighted route you need to go, and the current and next street(s) at the top are excellent. Also, the estimated arrival time in the lower left is nice, but does not account for traffic jams.  The arrival time will just keep getting pushed back the slower you travel.  It's kind of a "best traffic scenario" prediction. --- This is so easy to use I'm thinking of buying one for my 68-year-old mother who doesn't have a clue when it comes to technology, but I'm convinced she could use this without a problem (once I've loaded the maps for her.) --- If not having bluetooth and all the other latest bells and whistles on a GPS system doesn't bother you (as it doesn't bother me) buy this, you won't be sorry!
I got this perfume in a set of 4 ohter perfumes from Estee Lauder. This one is really special...so good..light.. I loved this perfume more than all the others that I got in the set - pleasures was one of them.
Melrose Larry Green's book is full of quotes.  Quotes and information used to back up points are good things.  He appears to have researched by surfing the Internet, watching television and legally incorporating the opinions of others.  This is all fine and acceptable. ---  --- The problem with "Why the Clintons Belong in Prison" is when the author (cut and paste expert) attempts his own narrative, which is sporadic, jumpy and poorly edited.  His points are not linear, and show the author's attention deficit.  With a proper literary team, this book could have been something of note but unfortunately it feels like a "hit and run" report and reads like a one-sided sensationalized talk radio program.  
My wife loves this magazine so I bought her a one-year (6 issues) subscription through Amazon.com for $25.60.  That turned out to be a foolish and impulsive move on my part when I found out that I could have subscribed directly from Healthy Cooking for $14.95 for one year or $19.95 for two years.  Although I have realized significant reductions on book costs, clearly this magazine subscription is excessively priced.  I will shop more carefully in the future.  
not a bad typing program for kids.  it keeps my kids interested for about 15-20 minutes a day.  they complain about all the practice pages for the games...but , hey!  it's a typing instructor!  you gotta pratice! once they start playing, they have fun
We subscribed to this magazine, in part due to the special offer of 12 free cycling booklets & road log with each new subscription.  What did we get?  A note letting us know that unfortunately "the gift described in the promotion is no longer available" and that "rather than keep us waiting, (they've) taken the liberty of sending the enclosed substitute..." The substitute?  A crummy little pamphlet.  ---  --- I let it slide at the time, but several months later they were still offering this special promotion, so I wrote a letter to customer service stating that "since they now had the special gift, perhaps they'd be so good as to finally send ours."  No response. ---  --- Time came to renew and all of a sudden there was that offer again... so against my better judgement, we did.  And guess what!  Another note "unfortunately the gift described in the promotion is no longer available..."  and the same crummy pamphlet!   ---  --- In short, if you're interested in being lied to, or receiving a stupid little pamphlet, by all means subscribe... if you want what you paid for, go somewhere else.
No more worries about being too short and missing the bowl.  Yea!!! 
These mats are easy to use, and pretty durable, but I find them to be too slippery.  Not enough friction.  A thin rubber surface would be much better
it says it's an A/V dock for video ipods but it only would transmit audio to my tv. i'm really pissed about this product.what a waste! A/V cables that sell for 20$ are incredible. they sinply plug into the headphone jack of my 80 gig ipod and into the a/v inputs of my tv
You better know how to use a chromatic tuner if you buy this because the "instruction" booklet doesn't bother to tell you. I've got red and green lights flashing at me--have no idea what all this means
If you can smell the chemicals being emitted by these slippers than your child is breathing them in! Also the chemicals are being absorbed through the skin of your childs feet.  They are made with known cancer causing chemicals. They are also manufactured over seas wher the DEQ,EPA etc; have no jurisdiction over the processes used to manufacture these slippers.  My two year old daughter was given a pair and they are now hidden in the garage. Did not want to put them into a land fill until some one has analyzed the toxic emission from these horrible smeling slippers. Benzene, Poly Vinyl Chloride, all kill the liver.
I love this game, it is so much fun.  Even though my wife does not like it I recommend this game for anyone who like Mario Kart games. ---  --- Enjoy the races, and don't forget to blow your friends up
My daughter had this when she was a teenager. Now my grandchildren come and play the game she had. To preserve the original game I ordered new ones to replace my daughters game when she had it. The grandchildren, all 6 of them, love playing this game at our house
I work at Best Buy and we install this piece of garbage all the time.  For one its a huge system hog and two it doesn't catch much of the pesky spyware.  Also when computers come in to be cleaned up, no one uses this program (even though we're "supposed" to recommend it).  I would recommend xoft, pest patrol, or MS Antispyware much much more. 
I came across this watch on a Friday sale at well over half off, a great price. The features were more than adequate for telling time; dead on accuracy, plus date and day. I figured setting the watch couldn't be too difficult, there are only two buttons, so I purchased it with a gift card, totally painless. ---  --- The watch arrived a few days later and I had it programmed easily within 5 or 10 minutes. The watch band is pretty long so I had to remove a link from each side to fit, no special tools are needed. While traveling, setting the time zones is easy as city codes around the world are listed on the back. The wave ceptor function works fine in Boston and in Europe. ---  --- I usually wear more expensive watches than this, but this one looks great,  much better than in the picture. The specs say it has a metal case, but it doesn't. It has resin buttons, case, and back, but with some metal cladding. The band is all metal
This phone is a great corporate phone.  It is the best windows mobile phone currently available, in my oppinion.  ---  --- They overlooked a few features:   --- -There is no LCD light to tell you its charging status - instead the screen has to be on all the time.   --- -There is no way to know when the num lock key is on - so you just have to press a number key and see what comes up. --- -In order to unlock the phone, you have to press the on/off button at the top of the phone, which is not in a very convenient location. --- -The track wheel feels pretty cheep
for the price, not a bad piece of home gym equipment. cushion could be softer but overall it works the back & abs real good.
I own one of these, it came packaged in my Dell XPS Renegade. Sound in a Windows environment is good, as indicated by other reviews. But in a gaming environment for example World of Warcraft, and not just this game, I and other user's have experienced the squeal of death, wherein the sound will become replaced with a high pitched squeal, and may hard lock your computer. Either way this can only be corrected by rebooting. Check out the forums before buying any creative labs products. BUYER BEWARE!
I am quite dissatisfied with the quality of the new Leatherman tools.  I purchased two Leatherman Squirt S4's and the Leatherman Micra from Amazon recently and was surprised to see that all of them arrived scratched up(like it was used before).  Some scratches were wide and deep enough to cause cuts on your hands when you use the tool.  I purchased the Leatherman Charge XTi from another vendor, which was also not of high quality that Leatherman was once known for.  I have owned the original Leatherman Wave since it first came out and have had no problems with it.  It seems like the newer models are being mass produced without some type of quality control.  Or maybe someone is repackaging used Leatherman tools and selling them as new... --- I will not be buying anymore Leatherman tools until they start making high quality multitools as they were once known for. --- If you want to buy one of these, either for yourself or as a gift, I would suggest you go to a store and look at it before you buy.  Make sure there are no scratches or smeared letterings or any other problems...The ones I recieved were definitely not good enough to give as gifts
I had the distinct pleasure of seeing Richard Jeni live a few years ago and I gotta tell you that I really almost peed my pants. He was astoundingly funny. This DVD definitely captures his comic genius, although it is woefully short compared to the amazing talent that he is and that he expressed in the huge amount of material he developed. ---  --- It was incredibly sad to see that he took his own life which, from what I heard, was based at least in part on the fact that he was not able to get the gigs he used to get, which is itself really sad. He developed what I think is the best comedy, which is comedy that stings and bites because it reveals us human beings as full of weaknesses that are, ultimately, pretty stupid in the face of everything good in this world. ---  --- He will be sorely missed in this world that needs more people to show us all the dumb things we do...and by doing so, how we should and can be a lot better than we are
In the classic and disturbing 1972 movie Deliverance, Lewis (Burt Reynolds) gives this ominous warning to Ed (Jon Voigt): "Machines are going to fail. Systems are going to fail. Then... survival." ---  --- What, I wonder, will Richard D. James (a.k.a. Aphex Twin, a.k.a. AFX) do when the machines fail? ---  --- It's been nearly five years since his underappreciated album drukqs, where we got a tantalizing possible answer to this question: the plaintive, lovely, Satie-esque acoustic keyboard nocturnes intermingled among the abstract, frantic electronic soundscapes throughout its sprawling duration. [Another intriguing solution was proposed on the album Acoustica: Alarm Will Sound performs Aphex Twin...] ---  --- Chosen Lords, RDJ's first proper CD release since then, is actually a collection of various tracks from his "Analord series" of overpriced, elaborately packaged 12-inch vinyl singles that he's been cranking out over the last year or so. Those who were put off by the excesses and overt eccentricity of drukqs may hail these cryptically titled, drum-machine laden compositions as a "return to greatness." Indeed, AFX is certainly reviving a more compact, accessible (for him), and straightforward style here, with comparatively regular (though not quite danceable) rhythms and those comforting underlying simple synthesizer melodies. ---  --- I have to say, though, that there's a disappointing and somewhat melancholy sense here of a great musical mind spinning its wheels. By returning to such familiar ground he seems to be setting up systems and letting them run their course in an almost cynical way, without any of the maniacal glee that was once part of his singular musical personality on unforgettable releases like Come To Daddy, Windowlicker, The Richard D. James Album, and, yes -- drukqs. Notably lacking are the voices that once regularly appeared in his productions -- true, they were usually rather unsettling, distorted, and manipulated voices, but at least they added some welcome humanity. Also missing are those rare but beautiful moments of repose (ballads?) such as "Flim," "Nannou" and the striking piano interludes on drukqs. ---  --- In the end, Chosen Lords, while an undeniably interesting and expertly produced collection of electronic music, is nonetheless a sterile, static, joyless affair. If it inspires any emotion at all, it will probably be pity and sadness as you listen to a possible musical genius coasting along without exploring any new directions for the first time in his otherwise remarkable career. ---  --- Yes, I'm afraid the machines have failed Richard D. James, and I sincerely hope he can survive in this cold and remote musical wilderness of his own creation..
I am a bit disappointed in the quality.    It looked like a possible reject off the factory line.  There are threads uncut and the velcro was sewed wrong in one of the side pockets. --- You really should not expect too much.  You may find something better quality in some of your local cheap department store chain.  
I bought this game a couple months ago and I absolutely love it! I am 14 and kids and parents of all ages will LOVE ths! it's great excerise and very challenging with cool music. It's like DDR, only with your hands. Try it, I promise you'll have a great time, I could play it all day
The learning curve on this watch if you use it for fishing may take some time.  The moon phase is nice to know about and the sunrise and sunset is pretty cool too, but I didn't give this watch 5 stars because for the money it didn't give me the one option I used more than any other on previous cheaper watches, a timer.  This one has the stopwatch but there is no timer you can set for say 10 or 15 minutes.  It keeps great time so far, but that's typical of Casio.  The backlight is very bright, enough so that you can almost use it as a flashlight, and the option on this model where you can set it for the backlight to come on everytime you hold your arm a certain way is cool.  If you're looking for a good water proof timepiece and you don't really care about the timer issue, this is the one.  And yeah I'm vain about what it looks like on my arm; it looks manly and cool
I used this product for a couple of months with no visible result. In addition it's quite greasy and since it's not made to be used on the face, we can understand that. But that makes it very hard to use along with sunscreen and whatever makeup one chooses. 
I'm a fanatic for gummy candy, especially the sour kind. But most sour gummy worms look and taste like a chemistry experiment, and most apple and (especially) apricot fruit(ish) rings taste artificial too. Haribo does a much better job; their pink grapefuit was my favorite gummy until I discovered these apple ones. They taste natural, real healthy apple flavor, less stridently sour than grapefruit. Now it's a tie for top place: apple and grapefruit. When I can't decide, I eat 'em both together. My dentist taught me that trick, believe it or not. I sometimes wonder whose side she's on...
Yes it does go and come off your head easier than most swim caps, but it doesn't keep your hair dry at all
I don't own any other superman movies but this one and it was a really good movie even though it was short.Some of the parts were funny with joker in it and some were with action were superman fights batman and that part was my favorite and the voice of superman which was voiced by Tim Daly and superman's voice was okay.This movie was the best that I rented it a few times and decided to get this movie on DVD and recently I found this at eb games for [..] and it was the last copy they were selling,oh and here is my favorite line,''It's over,Joker''.That line was a good line and I never heard joker call superman ''supie'' and that name just made me laugh,but still this was a good movie and the charcters of this movie were not so bad after all and this movie is highly recommended to any superman/batman fan
I purchased this for an Oktoberfest party, there was a lot left over, mostly because people were slightly intimidated or mostly really drunk.  The sweet tasted nicely and were decorated in a very pretty way.  I'd recommend this to anyone who doesn't want to make their own marzipan and needs to purchase a large quantity.  There are several little "flats" of the candies so you can package them seperately or give a flat away to a friend easily enough
This is first Canon product that has disappointed me with its quality. They must acquire them from their Chinese supplier for about 98 cents. This plastic device wobbles even when fully rotated to the detente position. I bought it to use with the Canon 250D close-up lens and it's barely adequate for that function. Canon should refund anyone who mistakenly bought one of these hockey pucks.
I was very pleased to find an 8 mega-pixel camera at such a reasonable price, ease of use and easy to use softwate for editing. 
Worthless. It rips off your battery door when you try to take the phone off. Flimsy and broke within a week. Not even worth the 0.01 I paid for it which is sad. :
With this software you can create a 2-D or 3-D game. --- Follow the tutorial you can download from www.thegamecreators.com (producers of the software) and you will create a real game in about 2 weeks of nights. --- [...] --- This box is the FULL package [...] The software is not as fully supported as the professional version, but for a hobbiest, it is perfect
This product is nice at first but you'll find yourself time and time again replacing it just so you don't have to put anymore holes in your home.  I've bought 5 of them over 4 years.  We have an expanding family and this things keeps on breaking.  DO NOT BUY, buy something better and higher quality so that you won't have to replace in 6 months.  PLEASE LISTEN TO THIS REVIEW.  IT WILL SAVE YOU
I bought this watch for the altimeter for climbing in Colorado - I recently went in January and it worked nearly perfect! Every location I could find an elevation marker, the watch was within 10 feet. The thermometer works well also, it just cannot be on your wrist to read the temp correctly. ---  --- The watch looks great, I wear it to work nearly every day. I would highly recommend it
I am vey unhappy with the sales professional in Nautica outlet stores. I had a very bad experience at Nautica store outlet stores. The customer service representatives are very rude and unprofessional. They basically said they don't really care if they lose one customer, other customers will  still buy. ( if that is the case, why are prices slashed by 50%...it is because people do not want to pay the full price ...)I do not think I will ever buy from Nautica. A few uncaring sales represtatives give a very bad name to the whole company
I love all of the bracelets that I've purchased from this vendor. They are cute and inexpensive... also, I've recieved so many compliments on this bracelet. I'm very pleased with this jewelry vendor
These noodles have a terrible, squidy texture and a wholly unpleasant smell.  They cook strangely and taste odd
Have had this less than two months and used it perhaps 3 or 4 times a week on slightly spritzed hair to tame the frizz.  The thing died!!  Did work great while it lasted....  Now trying a Conair, so keeping my fingers crossed
this magazine is sweet it features tons of eye candy, being plants and hot girls and buds, lots of great tips, tricks and info on the culture around pot
Like an apricot, but better, in my opinion. The downy fuzz, the sweet juicy flesh, there really is nothing like a good peach. I think they are best on their own, though some like to cut them up in a fruit salad or make a peach melba. That is fine, but I would strongly advise against cooking them. In my opinion, this is a waste of a good peach. A friend of mine swears by his baked peaches with demerera sugar and cinnamon, but he is a savage and a charlatan. ---  --- To conclude, peaches are without doubt one of the finest fruits around. There are few things as satisfying as a sweet ripe peach on a sunny day. --- 
Great product--just what I was looking for.  Service was excellent and shipping was prompt.  Thank you, thank you, thank you
I thought this video was disjointed and not oriented to any plot. Also the lighting was very dark and much of what was going on was unseeable
This is such a good mag! i loved all the crafts, animal pics, and other cool stuff. I learned how to feng shui your room and find out what a liger looks like. The jokes are funny too. this is one: What do you get when you cross a pig with a centipede?   Bacon and legs!. They also tell you cool facts like: Mona Lisa has no eye brows and most in england belong to the queen. So as you see this ROCKS! Buy it, buy it now. ---  --- -JAMI
We took this stroller to use for our 13 month old at Disney World & it was great!!  It held the bags we needed in the park and was very easy to get on and off busses / monorail / etc.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  It was great to have it in the airport too.  The only problem we had was that the cupholder was broken off by the airline when it was gate checked, but we can get a replacement. 
This comfort meter works very good.  The shipment came in time for a gift for Christmas.  One for us, one for gift. 
I highly reccommend this bag for anyone! It is a big tote, which is perfect for a college campus, the airport, the beach... really for any purpose. It is reversable and I was very suprised at how durable it is (great quality). When people compliment the bag it allows an opportunity to share its cause- which in the end is the most important part.
My 6-year-old got this for Christmas and he and his 4-year-old brother love it!  They enjoy doing the battles and coming up with different monster combinations.  It teaches strategy since they have to figure out which combinations work best.  My kids also like to just play with the figures by themselves like action figures.  A piece of advice though:  This game only comes with 2 figures so you really must buy additional figures or it won't be much fun since the point is to create varying combinations.  Therein lies the problem - or at least MY problem!  I can't find the extra figures for this thing!  Luckily, they were available around Christmas so I got some then, but now I can't find them in stock anywhere.  Also, I have not had any durability problems although I had some sound quality problems on the 2nd day.  Fortunately, it turned out that all I needed was new batteries. You really need alkalines for this game.  Overall, it's what my boys think though and they ADORE this!!!
Jonny's conversion is fine and I hope he is happy, but this album was not good if you are expecting the blues guitar work of his early albums.  If you want christan rock maybe this could be for you, but he missed the mark with me big time
Really worth seeing to learn about the life and talent of Budd Boetticher.  The collectors edition allows you to watch for the elements of the film that make it special
I'm sooo happy with all 3 of these scents.  The candy apple is definitely the most accurate and I'd sell my soul if I could only continue buying it on its own.  But the other 2 are good, too.  The cotton candy is awesome but not 100% on accuracy and the cherry sno-cone makes me start slobbering when I smell it.  Highly recommended
Like all cast iron cookware, not preseasoned, preseasoning is an absolute MUST. I use this product with the Bayou Classic Single Burner.It makes awsome eggs, bacon, and grilled cheese... whatever, with lots of space for cooking a bunch at once. ---  --- Great for camps, or just in the backyard for fun.
I really enjoy playing with this harp whenever I get a chance to because it produces a very good sound without having to blow or suck a lot of air in. I found it very easy to bend notes, in fact this is the first harp in which I was able to bend notes on. The roundedout edges are also very nice on the hands and it makes it easier to hold. It is made of plastic and not wood but that hasn't caused a problem so far. So I would reccomend a Hohner Golden Melody in any key to anyone. Although I would choose the one in the key of C, if you're a begginer because it would be easier to learn on I think
Since our bathroom cabinet is short on space, I loved the IDEA of this hair dryer! Unfortunately, the idea was more a fantasy than a reality. I only had this hair dryer for about a month before the cord-keeper button fell out (spring and all!) and the retractible cord stopped retracting. Since that was the only reason I bought this one over other models, I was sorely disappointed! Also, this dryer is so L-O-U-D that I had to wear earplugs (no kidding!) while drying my hair so that I wouldn't damage my hearing! Hands down the WORST hair dryer on the market
This book was "required reading" when I first started in the investment business 16 years ago -- It was a fabulous introduction to Wall Street and the stock market.  I have recommended it many times over the years, and continue to do so
I purchased this sterilizer about two weeks ago, and I have used it all of two times. It creates a horrible mess with water running everywhere when the lid is lifted, and I really had to wonder if the bottles were actually sterilized. I am terribly disappointed with this product, and truly caution those of you who are thinking of buying this to run from it like the wind
Music tunes into a part of the brain that might be connected to math skills. In any case, making music is fun, it's participatory and it teaches about rhythm, counting and doing things cooperatively. A collection of percussion instruments like blocks, and percussion accessories like sleigh bells are great to keep in a box for kids. Take them out and have the kids keep time along with a favorite cd or with a song they are singing. This is a very inexpensive toy and one that can teach a lot. It is also great for Christmas; bring the kids along to carol, and have the smallest kids keep time with the sleigh bells or make up your own percussion accompaniement.
I purchased this dvd for my very passionate son's 11th birthday.  When he opened it his eyes filled with tears.  He has loved gorillas, chimps, and all primates since he was very young.  I watched the movie before and was a little concerned about his reaction to Digit's murder.  It was as I expected, he cried in my arms.  His dream is to grow up and move to Africa to help in the survival of this extraordinary species.  The movie was given to him for encouragment from Ms. Fossey with all her beliefs and struggles.  We as the human race have a responsibility for all species on Earth.  This movie will open your eyes and make you realize how vain and selfish humans can be and it also shows that one person can make a difference and is still making a difference years after her death. ---  --- What strikes me about Mrs. Weaver is that she was also touched by Fossey's accomplishments and she is an honorary chair person for the Dian Fossey Gorilla International Fund. ---  --- Dian Fossey wrote this passage in her journal, "When you realize the value of all life, you dwell less on what is past and concentrate on the preservation of the future." ---  --- I hope this review helps you decide whether to buy the movie or not and brings at least one more person to acknowledge we must all do our part.
I love these magazines.  We subscribe to Ladybug, Spider, and Cricket (each for a different child).  The stories are great, as is the illustration.  An illustrator friend of mine says that it is very prestigious to be asked to illustrate a story in these magazines, and I figure it is the same for the stories.  No advertising, of course.  The thing I like the best is that each magazine is geared toward a certain age of child.  Highlights tries to be something for everyone, so we look through the magazine to find an appropriate story.  In Ladybug, we just start at the beginning and read straight through.  As the publisher will tell you, when your child outgrows Ladybug, you just let them know and they change your subscription to Spider (and later, Cricket.  That's as far as we've gotten)
The case is very big.  Why buy a small camera and end up with a big case.  The case looks nothing like the picture.  The picture is of another case. 
This little trike is wonderful!!!  My 2 1/2 year old loves it, as does our 5 year old neighbor.   The ride is smooth, and the low center of gravity allows for the racer instinct of most toddlers, without the high risk of tipping over.  I looked for a trike for many hours/days, and am so happy with this choice
Sound wasn't too bad for price. Tinny yes, but cheap. Used it a dozen times and then started having trouble getting it to play CDs. And then it wouldn't turn on at all.
this is absolutely my favorite magazine of all time.  if you want a magazine that caters to the lowest common denominator, readsomething else
I have loved this movie since I was a kid.  It is lightyears better than the Hornblower series that was on A&E.  I have read Forester's Hornblower series at least 10 times and never get tired of returning to them. ---  --- Gregory Peck is not quite the Hornblower that I have come to know over the years, but he does a great job.  Thank goodness this movie is out in DVD.  My VHS version is on its last legs
This is not the book to learn the basics of VBScript, but it's exactly what I needed; a good reference book. I got tired of trying to find syntax of commands and functions online. Now I have it at my fingertips
 Ed Klein is really so desperate in his attack that he can't find any one person who will use their names in the attacks against Hillary!  ---    What a lot of misinformation and outright lies. To actually accuse Marian Wright Edelman of using children for her own ends is short of criminal, and to insinuate that Chelsea was the result of a rape, even though on the next page he discusses their fertility search to become pregnant, is disgusting.  ---    I should have known what to expect when the first two words in the book were Monica Lewinsky! 
This magazine might be good if you were wealthy enough not to have to work, had time to work out four hours a day, had your own chef, could go on vacation six months out of the year, or could afford (or cared) about fashion. Otherwise don't bother. They sometimes have a decent or interesting article but they are so few and far between it is not worth it
I was all set to purchase this bag but wanted to try it out first.  I had great difficulty finding one locally but finally after many many phone calls I located one bag and asked the merchant to hold it till I could get there to try it out.  Firstly, the bag is nice but doesn't hold as much as I thought.  It still could have worked for my but for one thing: this bag is not designed for those with a, er.....womanly build.  It was the most uncomfortable bag I have ever tried out and looked absolutely ridiculous on me.  So glad I was able to take it for a test drive before purchasing online.  Just a word of warning to the ladies;-
I bought this thinking it would be great, but have been VERY disappointed.  The suction cups don't stick very well (especially on wood)even if you wet them first.  My daughter is able pull it right off the table and dump the mess on the floor
First, the Volvo wagon is supposed to be scaled for the Midge series of Barbie dolls, slightly smaller than regular Barbie. --- Another annoyance, it comes with a little pink roll-on suitcase full of microscopic Fisher-Price replica toys that have nothing to do with the Volvo.  I put all the tiny pieces together in the suitcase for my granddaughter and the suitcase wouldn't close. I looked on the box illustrations, and sure enough, they show a suitcase NOT CLOSED.  How could they design such a silly bunch of add-ons?  I just got rid of all that teeny-tiny stuff that doesn't relate to the inherent play value of the car.  Any kid would prefer to put her/his own stuff into a little suitcase than this mishmash of silly product promo from Fisher-Price.  Would have been nice to have a choice of colors, even approximately the REAL colors that the Volvo wagon comes in.  I just wanted my granddaughter to  be able to play-like with Grandma's white Volvo wagon.  How hard should that be?  Overall, I'm disappointed with this toy. For 28$, shipping included, I expected a better toy.  Not worth the money
I was looking for a beginner microscope for my 7 year old.  This was probably more than she needed for her age, but with adult supervision, it should last well into her later elementary years.  The package came secure and on time.  It was exactly what I expected.  It is a solid product and I prefer the plug in option that this product offers versus other products that require batteries.  The highest power (400x) is difficult view with some slides but I believe it has to do with practice.  We have been successful viewing certain slides with the highest power setting with some patience.  It is absolutely fascinating.
The printer is fast and printing is always properly aligned on the paper. Quality of printed text is as good as any decent desktop printer and that is why I bought it in the first place. I am yet to try printing photos. Because this is a mobile printer the manufacturer needs to ensure that the unit will stand up to the hits and accidents caused by regular transporting. It might mean providing a second skin or a padded bag with the uni
These strawberries are great.  They are great on cereal.  The price is fantastic.  My kids had some freeze dried berries at a "space center" but they were much more expensive.  These are a steal.  I am so happy to know where to get great freeze dried berries at a great price. 
my son is absolutely loves this dvd/games.  I have to turn off the main switch to the computer in order to keep him off of it and play with his sister. he learned so much since I got this learning system and I am totally extati
I like this product very much. It is very soft, unlike the other tubs where I was scared that my son would hit his head. The only drawback I have about is the belt....maybe in the next one they can come up with a good belt that would hold the infant. Other than that I  would recommend it to anyone. It looks very comfortable too. Especially if you have taller babies this is the best bathing system
This book was recommended to me by several people as I interviewed hiring managers, HR personnel, senior-level employees, and others for my own book on the job market.  By all accounts, my own included, 201 Best Questions is comprehensive, helpful, and tactical, an important read when one is preparing for an interview.  It is not an all-inclusive resource, only interview-targeted, but for what it is, the book is top-notch
I've owned a Tracfone for 3 years.  My old Tracfone quit working, so I purchased a new one.  I've been trying for 4 weeks to transfer my old phone number to my new Tracfone.  It's been a nightmare-after 4 weeks, 3 new sim cards, and countless calls to TracFone customer service reps, I've accomplished nothing.  My phone is still not activated, I still don't have my old number transfered, and I've wasted 7 hours speaking to customer reps.  I don't recommend TracFone
This book is beautifully constructed, concise, gracefully written, and should be of immense help to most golfers.  If you've read Ernest Jones, Percy Boomer, or Jimmy Ballard (for example) and enjoyed the insights but found it difficult to transfer the written word to your swing, try "The Keys ...": You will read a book that may finally lead you to improve your game.  My swing improved markedly after I came to understand author McTeigue's "lighthouse turn" (Lesson Two: Momentum).  
Let me count the ways. ---  --- They're great for a quick energizing snack/ breakfast/ healthy dessert, and tonight I even had one for dinner.  They are delicious and you feel good about eating them because they're good for you! ---  --- Plus you get a lot of bang for a deceptively tiny ball... they're very filling and only about 200 calories. ---  ---  --- GENIUS
She really brings a character to life.  And this short series of British comedy was really enjoyable
This gate only worked for 8 months and the latch broke!  The company would not replace it because they only offer a 90 day warranty.  They will not even let you buy a replacement part.  They want you to buy a entire new gate.  What a rip off!  Don't buy this gate, it is a piece of trash
My son really likes the way the picks make his guitar sing
I really enjoyed this book. I found it in a bookstore one day and read it for pleasure slowly. I am a theory student (now) so I wanted to see a lot more math, but aside from that shortcoming (which some might welcome) it was just a fantastic description of fluid motion and derivations of the governing equations on a simple level.
Overall I don't like it. When the screen is black between scenes and what not, their is a lot of mixed in red and other colors from interference. Buy a different one, this one is just not up to the task
I got it just today and used it for cleaning my lens. The solution might be useful, the blower is useful, the swabs can be useful with their pointed tips, but the so called "magic cloth" is anything but magic. It kept leaving lint on my lens
This robe virtually fell apart when I washed it.  It stained the inside of my washing machine.  It raveled before I even got a chance to wear it.  Do not buy this product.  I got the burgandy one.  I am so disappointed by this product I may stop shopping at Amazon
I bought this because I wanted a primer for make up, but have acne prone skin and felt that most other primers would make me break out, as some reviews have stated. Initially I did break out a little, but I kept using it becuase the rest of my skin looked so great and felt so smooth. After a week the breakouts went away (they were minor) and all I can say is WOW. My skin looks so much better, my make up looks better, I look better without make up, etc. etc. I use it with Complete Me powder foundation and I have never in all my 38 years been happier with a pair of products.
2 Fast 2 Furious is one of those sequels that comes around every so often that doesn't require you to have seen the original. I saw this movie for the first time not too long after it came out, and having never seen the original, I thought I would be lost and wouldn't enjoy myself as much as other people, but on the contrary - I left the experience much happier than when I came in. ---  --- This film is full of quick one-liners that deserve a laugh. The special effects and the car races will leave your mouth gaping open. I have heard and read that people didn't appreciate this film as much because it seemed to focus more on a plot than the first film did rather than focus more on the races, but overall, I think the balance works well. Even thinking of the plot that we are left with, I really can't see another time when a race would even be appropriate. ---  --- And as for people saying that this film is worse than the original, I would have to disagree...Why? Frankly, I have always been a firm believer than Vin Diesel is entirely overrated as an actor. (I mean, c'mon - Have you seen the Pacifier?) He's nothing more than a meat head who, while able to do pretty good fight scenes, should leave the dialogue to someone else.  ---  --- Yes, this film is for the younger crowd, and there are numerous occasions when unbelievable events take place (take the boat jumping as an example), but there is no saying that an older person wouldn't enjoy it as well...The only thing that I will say is that you really shouldn't go into this film expecting an Oscar worthy performance, or else you will be disappointed. If you sit back and take this as the fun romp that it is, however, you will thoroughly enjoy yourself
I bought these just a couple of months ago but i've already put them to the test. I went hiking to a waterfall in Mexico, I ended up covered in mud, my new shoes included. I was worried they would be spoiled (it really was a lot of mud). Then I just washed them with running water and all the dirt was gone. Besides being really comfortable, it's great to know that you can use them in all types of terrain and they will do the job.
Excellent value for money. Our 8-month old enthusiastically used this seat as a travelling feeding chair as well as a floor chair and we wouldn't have managed the holidays without it!  This seat is strong and stable, yet easily assembled/dis-assembled.  It folded flat to fit in our suitcase and has become a valuable travel companion with our young family.  We purchased this on 19 Dec and it was delivered prior to Christmas - well done Amazon
do not buy this system.  for the money there are much better systems out there.   ---  --- I bought this for my family room mainy for the small size of the cube speakers.  The main problem with the system (which bose has corrected by the way) is that the "acoustimass" component (bose's fancy name for a subwoofer) is not active (or powered) which means the base is totally inadequate and is overun by the cubes which have no mid or bass ranges.  The result is that you get a very "tinny" sound out of most applications including dvd's.  I ended up getting a sony active subwoofer and it sounds much better.   ---  --- In hindsight I would have bought a different brand than bose, but already had to much invested in bose to scrap the system completely, and the size of the cubes is nice.  Still pissed that I spent that much money on a substandard system, but hey, got sucked into the bose marketing machine
This movie is very simple, and unique. It's the kind of love story which you really believe in while you're watching because it doesn't feel phony. This can be credited to the acting, the situation, and the plot as well. This isn't about a man falling madly in love with a beautiful woman and then spending his life missing her. That's all been done, and that's what makes this film a breath of fresh air. River Phoenix shows why he is missed by so many, and really allows you to connect with his character. I recomend this to anyone who wants to see love put to true art, and be touched at the same time
This is the same as A. T. Cross black ink for fountain pens. This ink is popular with fountain pen enthusiasts. It feels good during writing. It dries to a nice, dark, opaque black color. It is not very water resistant. It is not safe for writing checks
I thought I was upgrading from analog to digital but after seeing the videos I shot indoors I liked the analog better. Very poor and grainy.  Also the focus is terrible! While filming 3 people in a row moving from one to the other the focus would blur then refocus.  I filmed my daughter's ballet recital and could not believe how the auto focus kept bluring then focusing.  Very disappointed with this purchase.  I guess it's true what they say. "You get what you pay for"  It seems under $600.00 doesn't get you much
 I tried. I really tried, but I was simply incapable of getting into this program. The lead character in Nighty Night is so thoroughly, contemptably self-centered and unlikable she makes Larry David in Curb Your Enthusiasm seem like a big cuddly teddy bear. This is a person who has not had an unselfish thought for another human being in her entire life. She's also insane. Completely. And not in a cute or funny way. She dosen't live in this world. She lives in one where the entire universe revolves around her, making it entirely acceptable for her to say or do anything no matter how ludicrous, dishonest or rude. She literaly has no idea she's a monster. I can see how that could be funny but not with this show's incredibly dry, lifeless presentation. I never thought I'd say this but Nighty Night could actually use a laugh track to let us know when the producers think we're supposed to laugh. And I hate laugh tracks.
I just finished seeing the movie and loved the song at the end and immediately started looking up amazon for this song.  Thanks to Melania for pointing out the song title at the end. I realize this CD is just a soundtrack, but typically most soundtracks also include the ending songs. It is just plain dumb not to include the best music in this CD.   ---  --- MY VOTE - DO NOT BUY THIS CD. The soundtrack is all pretty generic stuff.  BUT GET THE ENDING TITLE SONG IF YOU CAN - It's great.  ---  --- 
This item is REALLY small. I didn't read the other reviews and missed the info on the actual size of the item. In hindsight, I wouldn't have order it had I paid more attention. I think the other products from Haba (eggs and teabags) are worth the money for the size.
the product seems like a great idea, however, it did not come with attatchments for an i-pod, which is the reason we bought it.  Called the company to get the adapter and now need the mfg part number.  it has just been a hassle
I bought three of these for friends for Christmas and I have to say that I LOVED them.  And most of all THEY LOVED THEM.  They are gorgeous!  Just enough sparkle without being too much.  I highly recommend this if you are looking for something classy and slightly understated
This movie is laughable today. It's very dated, and it shows. It's not worth your time. The acting is so-so, but felt forced (like William Shatner style). The storyline is okay. By today's standards, it appears like a low budget flick
Like the other reviewer, I have this clock in my office - in my case in the middle of a warehouse. ---  --- Within 2 minutes the atomic clock had connected and set the time and date.  It has been in wireless contact ever since (there is an icon to let you know) ---  --- The time numerals are a little over 2" high and very clear - easy to read from 50' away.  The day, date and temp displays are about an inch tall and also very clear, but since they are so much smaller they don't have quite the distance visability. ---  --- It is nice to have a clock around that is always right - keeps my meetings on time - no arguement over whose watch is correct
This stuff is the worst smelling conditioner I ever encountered.  The perfume penetrated my hair and has not been able to get removed.  It took 2 days before the scent calmed down enough that it was not bothering me with its obnoxiousness.  I wish I could give it a negative rating.  I am glad all I used was a sample and did not pay money to make my hair stink
The gun broke about 7 days after my son received it and the people WOULD NOT take it back - said he'd had it too long.  I will never buy this product, nor work with this seller again.  HORRIBLE.
The skin fits well & the belt clip works well. It seems a bit bulkier than my friend's Zen skin & belt clip...but she paid about $10 more than I did! I would definitely recommend this product. I have yet to use the armband so I can't review that right now.  ---  --- My only issue is the screen protector fits into the window of the skin, not Zen screen. So the screen protector is smaller than the Zen screen. The window of the skin covers a couple millimeters of the top of the screen, but that part only tells the time anyway
I have read several of Hiaasen's books and loved them.  They were very funny.  This one is not.  It is an endless description of naked strippers.  I found the main character, Erin, to be very unappealing.  She is just so stupid.  Her problems are all of her own creation.  And she is not funny.  I think you have to be a man to like this book.  I, as a woman, just found it exceedingly boring.  I kept waiting for it to get funny.  It never did
Man oh man...I love documentaries and character studies. ---  --- Crumb, Capturing the Friedmans, The Thin Blue Line etc... ---  --- But THIS...my god, the mind boggles at the level of pretentiousness of the folks who claim to "love" or "get" this horrible mess. ---  Over an hour and a half of two crazy women who are essentially shut-ins rambling on about nothing at all in what looks like an abandoned shack surrounded by vermin and garbage a foot deep. ---  The two women in question are "Big Edie" and "Little Edie", the aunt and cousin of Jackie O respectively. ---  ---  Let me sum up the whole 100 minutes for you; ---  --- Little Edie: I hate it here. I had to leave New York to come here and take care of my mother. --- Big Edie: I was fine. I used to have a lovely singing voice. --- Little Edie: But I missed out on my big chance to make it. --- Big Edie: Oh well. You missed out. --- Little Edie: I miss New York. I hate it here. --- Big Edie: Did you feed the cats? --- Little Edie; YES!!! I fed them!!! --- Big Edie: I used to have a lovely singing voice. ---  ---  Now imagine this being repeated over and over again for 100 minutes. ---  ---  Do yourself a favor; Before you let anyone talk you into seeing this piece of dreck just go sit on skid row for 2 hours and listen to the rambling of the hobos and mental patients. ---  You'll save the money and get some fresh air at the same time. ---   --- Horrible. --- Just plain horrible
This straightener has been one of the worst I have ever used. It didn't straighten at all. I had to go over sections of my hair more than 10 times to get it at least semi straight. It did not stay straight either.<br /> --- WASTE OF MONEY!!! DON'T BUY
The darn thing broke almost immediately. ---  --- When I tried to switch gel covers (it comes with 3 different sizes) the entire earpiece came off in my hands! ---  --- What a flimsy piece of crap. ---  --- I just sent it back to Amazon. I'm never buying a Jabra product again
Very very loud-enough to make you're ears ring (thats a good sign) ---  --- Bass is very deep and the silver volume dots on one of the speakers are touch sensitive like the ipod-now thats cool. ---  --- Great great desktop speakers, and they can hook up right to your ipod. Worth the money
This is a perfect office suite for those who don't need all the new stuff that is available in office 2007. Outlook appears to be working great without some of the hang-ups in earlier additions. Probably more stuff in here than most people need, but it is easy to use and has some great enhancements
I was very disappointed in this dryer and am returning it.  It is very heavy and I am not a weakling!  It is also very big.  With my arm stretched out all the way I can barely get it to my head.  Because it is so heavy and big I have 'banged' myself on the head with the 'fingers'.  Just things to consider when deciding whether to buy this dryer. --- 
When this adapter first arrived, I thought it was great. The sound quality was excellent, and free of all the distortion and interference I get from using an FM transmitter-style adapter (there are few open frequencies in the SF Bay Area). The first day, I used it for about 20 minutes total (didn't have far to drive), and it worked great. The second day I had a bit farther to drive. After about 30 minutes, it quit. Hasn't worked again since. ---  --- I didn't expect it to last forever, but less than an hour? ---  --- Yes, it has a 1 year warranty: just send the unit back with a money order ($6) to cover the return postage. Of course, then you're spending more in postage than you originally spent for the unit..
We bought this bicycle for our son's 3rd birthday.  He LOVED the bright colors and the fact that it has somewhere for his horses to ride!  It has taken a little while for him to get used to the training wheels, but the bike stays steady while he is riding and doesn't threaten to tip.  We are very happy with this bicycle
I really had no faith before this book.  Not really sure what I should of beleived.  But this book def changed my point of view and it is shocking! Eveything just seemed ot come together and to me it just makes complete sense and I feel that this book is entirely true.   It would be great to see the world come together in world peace if they only knew the truth.  I knew the government covered stuff up but I had no idea to the extent they would goto to keep their undreground society such a secret and ruthless and would stop at nothing.  He doesn't say it straight out but the way it is described protrays this secret rogue group to be the illumnati with unlimited funding to carry out their evil intentions.  Greatest book I ever rea
This pedometer is easy to set up and use.  I tested its accuracy at the local highschool track by walking a 1/2 mile, and sure enough, my pedometer read 1/2 mile. The clip is sturdy, I haven't had any problem with the device falling off.  The leash is a good extra - if it did fall off, it wouldn't hit the ground.  My doctor gave me a goal of 10,000 steps per day, so I wear this all day long.  It is light and I don't notice I am wearing it throughout the day. ---  --- The only downfall to this device (as is probably true with others)is that your stride is measured for walking, so when you are running or doing other cardio activity (elliptical) it doesn't accurately measure your distance.  Since your stride is longer during a cardio activity (running), and the device is measuring your walking stride, the distance measurement falls short.  However, the actual number of steps taken is still accurately measured.  I suppose you could adjust the setting to a running stride when running to bridge this gap
Even though yugioh is dead, this is my favorite pack (even though i don;t get them any more). The deck that i made is an Archfiend deck, which can kill you if you don't have a spell card on the field that says you don't have to pay life points for Archfiend cards. They are also one of the strongest group if cards. There is TerrorKing Archfiend, InfernalQueen Archfiend, Archfiend Solder, and others. Even though yugioh is dead, some people still play ot, and some stores but them from you. I sold my deck for $$$, you should too.  
Like so many other small home office users, I have recently upgraded my network to 1000mpbs to help increase productivity.  Unfortunately, I originally purchased a GigE 8 port switch from another mfg. that used a fan on their switch, a VERY noisy fan.  After a month of listening to what sounded like an airplane engine, I tossed that unit and purchased this 8port Netgear GigE unit.  It is SILENT.  Basically a plug and play item due to its unmanaged nature, I have had good data thru put and no problem.  It comes with a small clip on stand for vertical storage if desired.  The unit is finished in an attractive gray and chrome exterior.  It is also small enough to live on a desktop with sucking up valuable real estate. ---  --- So, if you are looking for a switch that will not be stored remotely in some closet, this is the one that will keep the peace in your office. A+ ****
Grado has a world wide reputation for the best sound reproduction in their cans (audiophile speak for headphones) and they have the awards to back them up!  Too often though, I've read reviews where comfort is criticized and that these ear cushions are allegedly to blame.  Nonsense! ---  --- It is true that Grado cans are supraural (on the ear) as opposed to circumaural (around the ear) so you will feel the unit against your ears.  These cushions were redesigned back in 1998, offering greater thickness and distance from the transducer so that you feel more comfortable while listening through your cans AND the design allows for a greater soundstage for the magnificent Grado cans to impress you with.  These cushions, called "L-Cush" here, can be used on every single pair of current Grado cans except perhaps the $1000 set.  I use them on my SR60's, which come with a standard foam cushion that covers the whole transducer and it made them sound quite nearly as good as the SR80's!  I recommend them to you wholeheartedly!  If you google "The Listening Station," that is the place to purchase any Grado product from
This program is average to below average in it's abilities. ---  --- That said, just hope you don't need any Roxio tech support. --- Why? because Roxio's  support bites! ---  --- You CANNOT contact anyone online or by email for help; --- whenever their dis-functional "web portal" [web-based support] system traps you in an endless loop.  ---  --- I needed an couple simples updates for a pc that is NOT ALLOWED on the internet. ---  --- It used to be you could download Roxio's PATCHES from any pc having internet access.  --- Then burn patch[s] to a CD, or copy to floppy/jumpdrive. --- Then "sneakernet" the patches to the pc needing them. ---  --- NO MORE. ---  --- What happened today was that their webpage was apparently trying to download/patch a roxio product directly on MY pc. --- [EZCD5 doesn't exist on my pc]. ---  --- Instead of simply letting me download it somewhere, like to my hard drive, vs patchging it directly from their webpage to my pc, --- [which won't work in my case as I'm not using roxio, nor have it installed on my pc]; ---  apparently the morons that did the roxio webpage coding make the download/patch process STOP/END and proceed to send the customer back to Roxio's initial patch download page. ---  --- When you need a patch, all these endless loops and support games --- are enough to get me looking for a different product/different company. ---  --- If you want to minimize human contact with customers, fine. --- But let folks at least download the patches they need in order to keep their pc going. --- Don't hand over your customer support system [almost] completely to a WEB SERVER.  --- That ignorant arrangement works about as well as when companies try to save a few pennies and get rid of phone receptionists for customer service telephone calls. --- Then they let customers wade through a 100 layer deep voicemail system to find the answer to a simple problem. ---  --- IT JUST DOESN'T WORK. ---  --- If a company won't provide access to PATCHES,  --- even after I have logged into their website with username and password, [so they know is accessing their patches]  --- AND they  don't offer any type of  --- FTP site  as a download backup  option, then  --- I sure as heck won't be buying anymore of their products. ---  --- I see why Roxio bought up CeQuadrat and other companies. --- [Though I hate to see such quality companies be devoured like that].  --- When a competitor has a better product, why fight to improve your prodsuct's quality/features, when you can buy the other company out. ---   --- Thank goodness Nero is not under the Roxio umbrella. --- 
This drive has a great aesthetic design, but did not work out of the box when I received it. Amazon delivered promptly as usual, but quality of this product is definitely lacking. Look at the Western Digital... that's what I now have and have had no issues.
The slowed down almost spoken version of Downpressor Man nearly makes it worth the purchase price alone.  Sure I've got most of the tracks on other Tosh collections, but these recordings are excellent variants
I have not actually taken this underwater yet, but it appears to be well made and of similar quality to other cases. It keeps the --- over-all size of the camera/case down to a size that could fit into a BC pocket. On the downside, it does have only limited functionality of the camera through the available buttons. You can zoom and telephoto, change from camera,playback and to movie mode and shoot the picture. You cannot do any of the setup functions while it is in the case. Regarding a stobe, Sony makes one that looks a little cheezy. There is a "universal" strobe by Sea Life (SL 960D) that fits, but the fiber-optic trigger is just taped onto the flash of the camera. I'm waiting to how this works. One replacement O-ring comes with the case-replacements from sony were outrageously expensive. Color-correcting (red) lenses are about $100 from sony, but not needed if you use a strobe. (unless maybe to shoot movies?)
Portable, easy to use with any chip and really nice pix. I love being able to print from digital files on my ipod
The adage holds steady with this magazine.  What, to the hip consumer, appears to be a hopeful window into the world of cool turns out to be completely empty.  It would be insulting how hard they try to represent the scene of New York, if it weren't so embarrassing.  Get the village voice.  Try the other coast with Interview.  Just stay away from this disgusting fluff
The DAVA technology is my favored type in all situations. The combination of a flexible center and a rigid playing surface is wonderful. In addition, the pick surface is textured to enable a better grip with wet or dry fingers. DAVA is the only brand of picks I use and each type suits my every need. I whole heartedly recommend them to anyone.
Watching this movie is a very bizarre experience.  Having attended high school in the countryside, close to large clusters of Amish farms, I had heard stories from my friends at school about rumspringing Amish teenagers.  I dismissed most of them as rumor.  This movie confirmed that those wild stories I heard were probably true.  A very intruiging look at the flipside of a lifestyle most Americans cannot even begin to comprehend.  Worth a rental at the very least
All of the above reviews are correct.  They are nice looking and moderately functional.  I may pour some concrete to overcome some of the functional problems it has.  The stake needs to go deeper into the ground to keep it from coming out.  At $10.99 however, it was a great bargain, and a 4 star rating.  At it's current winter sale price of $16.99 however, it is a 1 star rating.  I'll average them weighting it's current price and give it 2 stars. 
If you like strong coffess, go with this, its wonderful! Definitely worth it
Rogers and Hammerstein's "Cinderella" is one of my favorite musicals ever! But does this rendition do it justice? Absolutely not!!!!! More glitz and fancier costumes do not a make a better musical by any means. Maybe if I was not enamored with Leslie Ann Warren or Julie Andrews who make far better Cinderellas I would have enjoyed this. I am not against a politically correct image like this story attempts but if it was done tastefully i would have appreciated it better. If you are a Rogers and Hammerstein fan like I am, you want to watch it anyway but its not merely as charming as the other ones. Its ALOT more exciting that the Julie Andrews version was recently found save your money and buy that one. However a younger audience or an audience that was not enamored with the other Rogers and Hammerstein Cinderellas will appreciate it far better
low tech and brilliant, music that seems to have channeled Zappa, Winchester Cathedral, and god knows what else.  incredibly funny, and then suddenly sad.  mr pink is a genius, you betcha.  and he explains what it is and how it is to live here in this strange quasi-city in the shadow of the industry, in the curiously full and fun wasteland of other people's dreams
My daughter just received this as a Christmas gift.  She was so excited.  My husband and mother-in-law went to the tv to install it.  15 minutes later my five year old is in tears.  I wish this had been reviewed before we purchased.  The graphics are terrible.  This will be going back to the store.  Glad I still have the receipt.
I was excited to plan out an interior design project with this tool, but ended up disappointed.  They definately oversell it as an interior design tool.  Looking at the brochure online, I really think they must have touched up the images, because I don't see any way that they could have created them with this product.  As a matter of fact, the website Punch Interior Design software package implies that they did just that. ---  --- The reason I don't give it 1 star is that the video tutorial section is really great.  I wish all software had that.  
The watch is very colorful. It is even safe to wear in the shower. However the watch cannot be read in the dark and the hands are even hard to see in daylight. It takes an extra few seconds to figure out wear the hands are. But adults who can't get enough of Harry should consider this watch
Better balance of songs on this Cd. This Cd shows growth in a the band.They are great fun live check them out if you get the chance!!!!!!!
I think I just don't like pilates because I really didn't care for this workout. Plus, you are constantly roling up and down and from years as a ballet dancer we have always been taught that rolling your spine when working the stomach will not flatten the stomach it will cause the muscle to bulk up in your stomach and you'll have a round hard belly. This is not my idea of an attractive waist line and this is true because it happened to a girl in one of my classes. So, that's the main reason I just didn't like this video
I'm more than satisfied with this scale.  I was concerned that I would have to buy a more expensive scale to get good accuracy (see reviews of other digital scales in this price range,) but I've tested it several times over several days, and my weight varies by 2 pounds or less over the course of the day.  My first weigh-in of the day is pretty much the same as previous mornings, sadly. ---  --- The neutral color (grey) and glass would blend in well with just about any decor, and the LCD screen is easy to read, with 1.5 inch high numbers. ---  --- The only thing I don't like about it is that it creaks quite a lot when I step on it, even though I'm nowhere near its 330 pound maximum load.  That problem is in my head more than in the scale: I don't think it's going to break, but it sounds like I've got two people standing on it at once--I'm not THAT fat, am I? ---  --- An added feature is that when I'm craving, I go into the bathroom and look at it, and know that it isn't going to fall for any of my excuses tomorrow morning.  So the last piece of cake still sits in the fridge.  The scale has intimidated me into not eating it. ---  --- Accurate, easy to read, easy on the eyes, and intimidating--I think it's a good deal
This sheet is great solution for difficult to change crib sheets- just lay it over the top of your pretty sheet and snap it to the crib frame.  I highly recommend it to those who don't like wrestling the crib sheet onto the mattress
These slippers are not a bargain. They fall apart within a few months and then you need to buy another pair again. Don't buy 'em. They're junk
I have been using the Fuji E550 for almnost two years, with none of the problems that have been reported by some of the reviewers.  ---  --- Here are the negatives:  ---  --- 1) The flash has mediocre range and is a little finicky. If you don't depress the shooting button all the way, it may not flash.  ---  --- 2) In bright light, the screen on the back is unusable - it washes out the image. BUT the camera has a fine viewfinder so this is not really a major issue. ---  --- The positives: ---  --- 1) It takes great pictures. Really excellent. ---  --- 2) It's small, and easy to carry. ---  --- 3) The controls are well thought out and positioned on the camera body. Very easy to use.  ---  --- 4) It has several automatic modes - sports, landscapes, portrait, etc, or you can use it on manual. I always use one of the programmed modes.  ---  --- 5) The video option is not bad at all - my twelve year old (now 13) uses it. ---  --- I was so pleased with this camera I bought one for my administrative assistant about ten months ago, and she is very happy with it. ---  --- At it's current price I think this camera is a bargain. Only reason I didn't give it five stars is because of the weak flash. ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  --- 
GREAT PRODUCT, DURABLE AND QUALITY STITCHING. WORTH ITS PRICE TO PROTECT YOUR GRILL
This item is cheap and I don't mean the price.  It will not stay together.  The plastic frames do not attach well to the mat because it is held with velcro that keeps coming undone.  The arched bars are not bent enough causing one side to pop up off the floor.  I tried bending them myself, but they always return to their original shape.  Pay the extra money and get a better mat
I have owned this for about a week and wanted to share some initial thoughts.  All in all pretty pleased with the purchase.  It was well packaged and worked flawlessly with my iPod Mini.  There are five additional templates that can be used to dock different models.  Panicked at first because they didn't have one for the Mini, but it was already installed on the model.  Cons: ---  --- - Light dimmer has three settings, but even the lowest is too bright.  You can turn it off and it can be controlled by the remote. --- - No ability to set a permanent alarm by day of week.  For example 7:00AM Monday to Friday, no alarm on Weekends. --- - Wake to music starts and accelerates to the preset (by you) volume in something like 7 seconds so it is definitely not gentle. --- - Sound is great for an alarm clock.  Don't think it will compare with a mini stereo or Bose SoundDock.   ---  --- Would buy again at the price
This game reminds me alot of the Grand Theft Auto series.  While it has many similar characteristics in the way you get around town, go into buildings, and the way you interact with the environment it still manages to offer a few original and interesting components to the gaming industry. This game has a great storyline that fans will likely enjoy.  Even if you weren't a fan of the movie this game is still a must.  Like GTA there are a few side missions (not as massive as GTA though), there are collectibles, and then you have main missions along the way.  While the object of the game is to take over New York, some of the warehouses and businesses can get repetitive, but its mostly all fun.  One plus is the police in this game tend to be less of a hassle unlike the GTA games.  This lets you keep playing rather than having to stop and restart at a safehouse or in the police station.  This helps speed up the game. The controlls take time to get used to but after you play for a little while you are good to go.  If you like the GTA format style of play you will certainly like this.  Also if you like the Godfather, the storyline to the game is great and really stays true to the movie. While its not the best game of the year it will certainly do until a new GTA comes out.  It took me about 2 weeks to finish the game playing a few hourse each night.  I hope they can come up with Godfather 2.  We will see...  
This product is exactly as described and arrived very quickly... A+++++ seller!  Will definately buy from again
My subscription was for a year. But the subscription office stopped sending the magazines even before the subscription expired. I would suggest people subscribe to Good Housekeeping directly instead
No other game looks or plays like this; The missions and locations are varied and colorful; The villians range from a fat guy with dynamite strapped to his person to corrupt law officials; And, as usual, Rockstar keeps the game play challenging but not overly frustrating; Lots of unlockables offer high replay. This is one of the most unique and best looking games on any system, period. I still throw this one in every 6 months for another go thru. The story is straightforward and engaging; Lots of really interesting concepts(machinegun in the coffin, crazy midgets, that whole 'dead-eye' thing...)and it controls very well. Another great game from an outstanding company. Hopefully a sequel is in the works.   
I had wished that I had bought this potty chair from the very begining.  I bought my son the royal potty throne from fisher price it ended up leaking.  I never could find the place that is was leaking.  So I purchased Babybjorn Green potty chair.  My son loved it the moment that I took it out of the box.  He wanted to use it in the family room.  I love it because it is only 2 pieces.  It's so super easy to clean. And it is green my sons favorite color.  Great price and great size.  I recommend this item
yesterday we where buying the christmass presents, when i saw there was the big air towel at 40 bucks, so i said to my mother if i could buy so she said yes, when i got home i began building it, after 6 hours i finished it. ---  --- And when i tried everything was going all right, so it wasn't that difficult  --- 
it was easy to order and very affordable and they were here quickly...I want to get more...thank
I purchased this CD during the lowest time of my life emotionally. Every track brought solace and comfort beyond belief, especially the title track, Deep Peace. I would listen to it over and over, bathing in the lush healing sounds. Each element, from the perfectly balanced vocals to the simple piano and violin motifs, is seemingly structured at a spiritual level. This is more than ambient music, it's true music therapy. --- 
This is a very good camera for the price range. I have always had good luck with Sony products, unlike some of the reviewers here. The resolution of the viewer window and the image quality itself is more than what I would expect from a camera in this price range.... it's pretty decent. For what most people use DV cams for, this is camera doesn't suck at all. --- I like how tiny it is. It doesn't go much past the palm of my hand when I'm holding it. Also it was very easy to figure out just by exploring the menu on the touch pad. Color graphics & icons on the menus add a nice touch. A beginner could start filming very soon after opening the box, I think. The camera feels sturdy in my hand, I mean I don't feel like the viewer window is going to break off when it's open or that I could easily break the buttons with normal use.  ---  --- As others have mentioned, you have to buy a 4 to 6 firewire if you have a mac because the iLink cable that comes with it is a S-video input for TVs. Also the battery that comes with it is the 30 minute battery but I would have bought an extra one anyway because you never want to wait around while your only battery is charging. The software CD is a do-it-yourself install, at least for Mac. It might not be for PC. I'm used to being guided through the installation process... (since at least the early 90's!) but I had to drag the folder to my hard drive my darn self.  A minor thing but I would have expected more from a major company like Sony. --- But the reason I give it a 4 star rating instead of 5 is because the firewire goes into the base, not the camera so you cannot have the camera on a tripod while it's connected to your machine. I realize this will not be a big problem for very many people but since I do stop-motion animation and use frame grabbing software, I need to have it connected to firewire and on a tripod in while I'm working. I almost returned the camera when I discovered this but instead I hot glued velcro to the bottom of the base and to my tripod adaptor so I could have the firewire plugged in and attached to the tripod....kinda ghetto. I figure it was worth it though since I got such a good camera for the price (I paid $299 on sale for it.) --- If you're looking for a decent but cheap camera I would recommend either this one or the hc42 if you want to shoot in widescreen.
   I'm a fan of Audrey Hepburn and this movie relys heavily - too heavily on her charm.  And unfortunately, it is some of her worst acting work, posey, sing-song, and superficial.  Now, if you've read her bio, and know what was going on with her and Holden, that could explain it, but still, this film is very static. ---    Like most Heburn films, a highlight is her clothes, her style, her self.  This film self-consciously relys on this when the script itself could simply have been better.  There are some very fun cameos by big performers that raise moments here.  This film would have benefited greatly by a better comic actress in the lead.  Jayne Mansfield could have been a hoot in this, Thelma Ritter too, in a very different way, somebody with less style and more off beat snap, crackle, and pop.  (Thelma Ritter and William Holden paired in a romantic comedy... I'm all ready laughing!) ---    Before I hit this too harshly, this film was intended to be a trifle, the kind of movie that has bright colors and light plot for a hot summer day that sizzles.  For that, it is adequate. ---    The remake, ALEX AND EMMA suffers very much from the same problems.  They actually improved the script, and gave the leading lady room to make some very wacky choices, but both films seem to have suffered from "settling for a star" when a less mainstream, more zany actress was needed.  OK, this doesn't stink...it has Audrey, but it certainly doesn't sizzle
Note: 4 1/2 stars is what I mean. ---  ---      This is one of the most gorgeous films you will ever see.  You can watch this film without sound or subtitles and still be enraptured. The breathtaking landscapes, the gorgeous use of colors, the wonderful costume design, the stunning dance and fight choreography will captivate you like few films do.   ---      The musical score is excellent, it enhances the mood of the scenes even further. The acting is also very convincing, your hearts will go out to these characters.   ---      The story is simple, but has some interesting twists, and is told very well. Compared to most movies there is very little dialogue, but you won't miss it.  Words are never wasted, every line seems essential.  My only qualm is with the final unfolding of events which are not bad, but were not up to the level of the rest of the film. ---      Target audience: Anyone who doesn't mind subtitles. 
Based on the reviews for this CD I decided to buy it without having sampled it. Big mistake. I love, among others, Marshall Crenshaw, Don Dixon and Peter Holsapple, but what happened here? This was so not fabulous
A GREAT PRODUCT FOR DRY SKIN, WITHOUT LEAVING A GREASY FEELING.  NOT ONLY DOES IT MAKE MY SKIN FEEL SOFT BUT IT SMELLS WONDERFUL.
The craftsmanship on this watch it absolutely top rate.  Very nice band, not flimsy or cheap. The world time is very cool
This is a nicly styled jersey that could use a fabric or fabric finish makeover. The plain polyester is rough to the skin requiring the use of an undershirt to prevent chafing. The collar is cut high enough to cut across the base of the neck leaving a nasty burn mark. ---  --- A cotton, cotton blend, or silk would have made a better choice of fabric making this an unbeatable jersey for many uses
Great movie! Pretty funny, and it has a  wonderful moral to it, but I won't give it away! Watch the movie! You'll love it
TOO BAD THERE WASN'T A RATING OF 0 STAR. THIS IS THE WORST PIECE OF JUNK I EVER BOUGHT. FIRST OF ALL WE WERE LOOKING FOR A BRAND CALLED SPORTS AFIELD. THIS ITEM FELL UNDER IT WHEN WE DID A SEARCH. WHEN IT ARRIVED IT WAS SOME OFF THE WALL BRAND.THEY WERE PAPER THIN BUT  THOUGHT MAYBE THEY WERE WARM BEING IT WAS FROM AN ARMY AND NAVY STORE. WRONG!!!!!!! THEY SERVED NO PURPOSE AT ALL.WERE NOT WARM AT ALL. .WE WASHED THEM PER DIRECTIOS ON TAG AND SHRUNK SO BAD I DON'T THINK A 2 YR OLD COULD FIT IN THEM.DO NOT BUY!!!!!!JUN
Ok! Being the richest human being on the planet called earth, Bill Gates decided that he's not wealthy enough. So he released this Microsoft office 2003, which I really think is not much different from previous edition. The price is, as usual, very expensive. What's worse is that Bill Gates decided all the pre-installed windows in new laptops and desktops come with the trial version. So mere mortals like us need to spend extra BIG money buying the full version to simply do some basic documents. --- I can see Bill Gates, being a deified bloodsucker, using $100 dollar bills as toilet paper, and laughing at us who work their butt off just to make enough money to live. SO SHAME ON YOU BILL GATES AND MICROSOFT
my son needs a watch and this is ideal for him its cheap and it non breakable
At first, this seems like a pretty good drink shaker.  The body and lid are fairly sturdy.  However, there's a separate rubber seal that sits inside the lid...  And if that pops out, which it's prone to do with mine, you're left with a leaky (and therefore useless) shaker.  The seal can be replaced with a bit of effort, but who wants to wrestle with a plastic bottle
I have a 2005 Ford Ranger.  I bought this unit and fully read the instructions before starting the install.  After that I began searching for the right connecitons on the steering column and connected up the unit.  I went online to find the correct placement of the wires and downloaded a printout.   --- The unit installed well, worked fine after initialization.  Came with a video that really helped in the installation.  I find the range on this unit to be super. --- I have no complaints
Nice Quality, but overpriced.  Does a nice job of protecting the front of the lens, and reducing glare in some situations
Sticking the solar module on the side of the garage door opener like they instruct doesn't work--the solar panel has to be right next to the lightbulb to get enough power to work.  I was able to mount it close enough to the lightbulb and make a small cutout in the cover to get it to fit--you might not be able to depending on your garage door opener.  Also the bracket that holds the laser module has too light a hold on the module, it doesn't hold it in rotational position
My table was shipped on a Thursday and at my house the next day!!!  As someone mentioned, the directions make it seem more difficult to assemble than it is.  There aren't that many parts to put together. ---  --- A tip:  Because of the weight of the box, I recommend opening the box and taking the parts to their destination individually.  Ours is on the third floor and I took about three or four trips to get everything up there. ---  --- I use it daily and really miss it if I don't get to.  I could really go for some inverting right now.  I found the cuffs very comfortable.  Shoes/boots are helpful, but my body has adjusted to hanging from my ankles even in socks.  I should get commission on these things.  The first weekend we had it, we had a birthday party for my sister and everyone tried it and many will buy it.  GREAT deal!!
This is not a good study guide for an employment law class.  Too basic and general.  This may be good for a business owner wanting basic info about hiring/firing etc, but they would definitely still need to seek the advice of an attorney
This is very BAD---doesnot work and really interfers with other programs. Almost impossible to remove it.
For those considering Outlook 2007, beware of my experience: one morning I ran Outlook 2007 to find it would not download email messages at all. (I would get an error about MAPI.) This appears to be due to an automatic office update of the junk mail filter. ---  --- One of the most important features of an email program is that it doesn't suddenly stop being able to check email (imagine being on a business trip). Automatic improvements to the junk mail filter sounds great, but if that means one morning I wake up to not be able to check email at all, then the medicine is worse than the disease. ---  --- The new features and changes Outlook 2007 really do not compensate for the lack of reliability. If you have another email program that works, I'd stick with it and not switch to Outlook 2007. ---  --- On a positive note, I was able to fix the above problem by running repair (reinstall) from the Office 2007 install program, but this took half an hour or so to run.
I bought this for a present for my 2 yr old daughter and she likes it and can turn the handle
This game is amazing. Unlike so many other star wars games, this is a first person shooter, which is a great touch to the star wars universe. I found the gameplay to be very well done with the healing stations on the battlefield and your squad always with you to revive you if you fall in battle. The coolest thing of all is that instead of carrying multiple weapons, you have attachments to one gun. The attachments are sniper, and rocket launcher. The single player campaign is outstanding, though the multiplayer is so-so. This game is simply a terrific Star Wars title
This item was durable, warm, the right size as advertised and the right price.
For average people who want a camera that just works-and takes good pics you should not buy this. I don't know about the specifics, but like other reviewers mine got stuck and quit working for no reason after a couple of months. So, I don't really see what all the bells and whistles are for if it doesn't even take a picture. It was fine while it worked, it ate batteries but the pics were good
I bought this camera after using a Sony MiniDV (very small one) camera over 8 years. The image quality of Sanyo is horrible compared to my old Sony under any condition: daylight, night etc. However price, size and easy operation makes this camera a winner as you can have it with you all the time. So if you want to use this camera as a second camera for everyday use go for it, but this is not a serious replacement to a high-end camcorder.
These are easy to use and easier to tighten than the pull through type tie downs.  These will work well to hold a riding lawnmower or golf cart on a light trailer.  They are also good in pickups to hold your load if you have  loops inside the bed.  If you're hauling anything heavier on a large  trailer, get some serious tie downs like the Keeper 05516's
The product not only did not work but blew out fuses in my car.  The mechanic who checked my car out said the device had a dead short in it.  I have written to your customer service department and asked for money back but to no avail.  I will not purchase another thing from Amazon until my money is refunded
It is an excellent movie, very well directed and the acting is superb. It awakens the natural instincts of empathy, compassion and love, for children all over the world are the same, ir-respective of color or ethnicity
my daughter would love a trampoline and i would love to buy her one but i don't know which one to get her.  the airzone 8' trampoline seems perfect but i also read the reviews for the airzone 13' trampoline which got terrible reviews.  i don't know what to believe.  can anybody help
This has helped my wife and I to lower our cholesterol.  I take it in conjunction with Red Yeast Rice Extract(this must be taken at night) because my numbers are very high.  My wife's numbers are right on borderline.  We took blood tests before and after using it and have seen great improvements.  My numbers went down 37 points in a few months and my wife's numbers went down about half of mine.  (I also take double the dose she does.)  It's a great way to keep healthy, naturally.  My father-in-law started using it and has seen improvements, also.  His dangerous PSA numbers (prostrate) even dropped radically.  We don't know if that was due to the fish oil-but he believes it was.  His dr. said he'd never seen numbers drop that much.  We tell just about everyone we know about it. 
I bought this to replace a C-Strobe light I used as a tail-light on my bicycle.  The C-Strobe was bright, flashed bright enough to make car drivers complain, and waterproof, just not rugged enough to survive being run over by a truck when it fell off my backpack.  This one was by the same manufacturer with "strobe action" and 1/3 the cost. ---  --- It doesn't flash, the "strobe action" is the way it appears to flash as you go in and out of the side ring of light.  It isn't anywhere near as bright as the C-Strobe.  I'm going to get a C-Strobe later this month from a local boating dealer
This toy does not work.  I do not recommend it.  There is no quality to the workmanship.  A total disappointmen
The shelves are not sturdy and the pockets are very small...don't waste your money, it's not worth it!
I suppose one of the great attributes of the internet is that it allows the juxtaposition of the good, the bad and the ugly. Where else could one find reviews of one of the twentieth century's towering works that variously describe it as a recipe for a police state, an incitement to theft, or as written by someone with no understanding of philosophy (my personal favourite - thanks Adrian!
I have used Corel Draw for many years, and too many had serious problems. This version seems to make up for the past with a stable system capable of most anything artistic. It is still a complicated system, though
Not as expected, too short,   nothing special for the price - took forever to receive ( about 3 weeks
never got to see it because shipping company carelessly left it on my porch and someone stole it along with other items. contacted seller and u.p.s. both told me basically I was out $45.00. tryed to report it to amazon but they intentionally have no contact info. on their web site. live and learn won't shop amazon again! thanks 4 nothing amazo
In the world of gaming, there are specialized magazines for each system (PlayStation Magazine, Xbox Mag, etc.), most of which suck because they only report on (duh) games on their respective systems.  Others, like Electronic Gaming Monthly, encompass most systems but only do it half-assed, not really giving you anything to make you think highly of it.  Then, there's GameInformer.  There are many things that set GameInformer apart from many other "gaming" magazines: ---  --- 1)  They have completely unbiased opinions about the games they play.  If the game sucks, they say so; if it's an awesome game, they'll tell you about it. ---  --- 2) Matt Helgeson (Senior Gaming Editor) and the other editors actually inform you about the game's most necessary attributes: its ESRB rating (E to M), their rating for the game (from 1 to 10), and a brief introduction to the game's faults and successes.  Best of all, however, they include screenshots from the game- and most screenshots rock. ---  --- These are just some of the reasons that GameInformer magazine is the absolute best gaming magazine on the market.  I have a subscription to this magazine and this magazine only, and I hope my review has explained why. 
This bike trailer seemed like a great deal. When I assembled it and tested it out it worked great, seemed very safe and comfortable. My daughter loved riding in it. Initially I was very happy with the product, especially for the price paid. Unfortunately after several weeks in the sun all of the white nylon straps - used for support and restraints - began detoriating and breaking. I would recommend spending a little more on a bike trailer that uses a better grade of materials
This is the perfect companion to take on your next trip.  No more excuses.  The gym is now portable.  With enough resistance to give you a decent workout.  This gym rat highly recommend these bands. 
My daughter is very happy with the product. She not only got the MP3 player she wanted, she also got her favorite color "PINK". Thought we got a great deal and it has been working wonderfully. Infact, my son is now jealous that his younger sister has a better MP3 player than he has
After hearing "I'm N Luv (Wit a Stripper)" I don't know why anyone would want to buy and listen to this CD in its entirety. I'm not going to type a bunch of long paragraphs about why this CD sucks. This CD is a waste and T-Pain is illiterate. There! I said it in one sentence. Holllaaa
House of Mirth is one of the most depressing movies I've ever seen. ---  --- To be clear: I've seen movies like, oh, say, "Schindler's List," or "The Heart is a Lonely Hunter" that treat tragic events, either in the macrocosm or the microcosm, that did not leave me depressed. Rather, they were powerful works of art that moved me and made me think. ---  --- "House of Mirth" deals with tragic themes, including human society's ability to destroy its own, and the power of hypocrisy and hypocrites. It wasn't, though, moving or thought provoking.  ---  --- I wasn't moved by Gillian Anderson's portrayal of a betrayed woman who lives by her own sense of honor. I didn't believe Gillain Anderson's portrayal of a betrayed woman who lives by her own sense of honor. ---  --- Rather, I was bored. I kept wanting the film to go faster. It's a great irony; Edith Wharton's novels are real page turners. Quick, to the point. Hollywood has yet to adapt one of her books in a way that honors this quality.  ---  --- "House of Mirth" has gorgeous clothing and sets. I didn't care about anybody onscreen, though. I didn't believe anybody onscreen. ---  --- I felt that this movie had a misanthropic agenda, and it moved its players around as if they were chess pieces, as if to prove these points: people are hypocrites, see! People are insincere, see! If a person has any decency at all, that person is destroyed, see! ---  --- I would tend to agree with all of the above points. So ... why do I need to watch this movie? ---  --- Also, as a woman, who, as Lily Bart was meant to, has lived her life by her own code of honor and paid the price for that, I felt that this movie, no less than the Polite Society it depicts so brutally, betrayed Lily Bart. ---  --- Lily Bart is just a step above a passive masochist in this film. She all but participates in her own destruction. You want, just once, for her to show some initiative, some intelligence, some ability to create her own fate. ---  --- The film denies her those abilities. In this crippling of Lily Bart, the film seems to hate her as much as polite society does. ---  --- Movies like "Gone with the Wind" that depict spunky heroines occasionally winning, and occasionally gaining some power, imo, are much easier to watch.  ---  --- One might argue that such films are not realisitic. I don't know. Even we real-life Lily Barts have our resources, and our triumphs.  ---  --- And, again, watching Lily Bart in "House of Mirth" slowly being eroded onscreen was not a feminist experience for me. It was more of an art house snuff film that utterly disempowered its female heroine.
I checked the reviews on many types of dictation software before selecting Dragon NaturallySpeaking 8 standard.  I recently had my wrist operated on and knew that I would be unable to write utilizing my hand for quite a while.  As an online student going to college I had to be able to participate in discussion boards and research papers daily.  This software was unbelievably easy to learn.  I followed the directions on setting it up so that the computer would recognize my voice.  I spent approximately 5 hours learning to program, and practicing before I was operated on.  I found that if I talked at my own natural speed the computer utilizing this software did an excellent job of deciphering my words.  I found the instructions very simple to follow.  Yes there were times that the computer displayed what I said incorrectly, but correcting it was extremely easy. --- I was able to keep up with my class throughout the six weeks I was in a cast.  My arm is still in a brace and I'm still using the software on a daily basis.  I'm actually using the software to write this review.  I highly recommend this software to anyone that needs to write research papers or that does a lot of computer typing on a daily basis. --- I am such a strong believer in the software that I know I will continue to use it even when my brace comes off. --- I found the software very compatible and easy to use even to answer my e-mails quickly and efficiently. --- This might be the perfect software to get for any college student.  To be able to look at research books and talk into the computer as you're looking up reference material is truly beneficial.  It was also very easy to stop Dragon software when you needed to to take a break think what you needed to write next.  All I needed to say was "go to sleep" and the microphone shuts off until you wake it out. --- To sum it all up the software was very easy to use and easy to set up.  I recommend it highly. --- Boca Raton Florid
 --- I'm no writer, I was just looking for a nice small notebook I could take with me while trekking to use as a travel journal.  This notebook is a handy little item to have with me in my pack. ---  --- It is of good quality, very much worth $10 if you want something more durable than your standard spiral notebook.  I like the elastic strap that keeps the book closed.  The book opens flat, and it is bound well enough so the pages are not going to fall out like some notebooks when you open and close them too much.  Small enough to fit in your front or back pocket too.   ---  --- Overall 5 stars.  The quality and style exceeded my expectations, and it was shipped on time with no errors
THE  QUALITY WAS GOOD AND THE STORIES WERE ALSO GOOD. I AM ON THE LIST WHEN THE FIRST SEASON COMES OUT. THIS IS LIKE A TEASE
it makes cotton candy in 30 minutes because  it has to warm for 10 minutes then it have to put put the suger in the middle then wait til becomes webby then wait agian to turn it off. ---  --- PARENTS THIS MACHINE DOSEN'T WORK ONLY MADE WITH SUGER THATS ALL IT IS AND ALSO IT TAKES FOREVER ? THINK BEFORE YOu BUY  YOUR CHILDREN WILL GET CAVITIES YOU WILL ALSO SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS INSTEAD OF FOOD OR OTHER NEED ---   ---  --- 
This shaver has met all my expectations. It cleans and recharges itself automatically. The shave is close and nick free. The only slight negative is the cleaning time per shave could run to 20 minutes
I got this device to help me clean around my place.  I thought it would be easy to use, and it is  not.  The pads do not stay on.  When you are trying to put them on, the solution leaks all over you.  After working on my shower, I saw no difference.  I wish there could be negative stars because that is what this piece of junk is worth.
Comes in nice display box with cushioned spaces.  A quality time piece.  Band has a felt backing for extra comfort.  The smaller items are buttons that are afixed with tie tack type closures.
Final Fantasy VII: Dirge of Cerberus is said to be the last spin off (aside PSP's Crisis Core), and the one that goes furthest into the future of the VII world. The game seems like a must-play for Final Fantasy VII and Vincent Valentine fans alike, and it is. Thinking, most of those fans probably play mostly RPGs, this game is relatively easier than popular FPS (shooters) like Halo. Being an RPG-fan, yet still wanting to learn the story of the game, I was very happy for the easy difficulty (though it can be bumped up to something more difficult and there are plenty of extras that are difficult to get outside the story mode.) The controls are a little bad, but nothing that someone can't get used to. For one of Square's second or third shooter games, this one is pretty good. ---  --- I'd recommend if you're doing what I did and playing it for story, then get the official guide so you can get all of the hidden capsules as you go (which unlocks the cutscenes and once you retrieve them, you never have to get them again). The guide is actually pretty good for this game, as well as the soundtrack. If you're a fan of the Final Fantasy music, definitely pick the soundtrack up. ---  --- Lastly, if you're a Final Fantasy fan or RPG fan, get this game and everything related to it. It's worth it. I couldn't put this game down, even if some characters are a bit under-developed. ---  --- If you're a shooter fan for games like Halo you will probably be disappointed
A nice try but just not that useful, I keep finding it falling out and U think it ended up on the couch now
Don't buy this compass if you need to know any direction. If you know about where the sun sets, you will be more accurate than this "compass." It is impossible to use in the field. A waste of money: inaccurate to the max, impossible to maintain it level, etc. Just junk. They should give them away
The idea of a nice warm wipe is great, but the product falls short in perfomance.  The warmer is designed for a non-popup type of wipe box. (If you use pop up wipes, just the part sticking out of the box gets warm, and the rest is cold.  If you use the other type of wipe box, it works ok as long as you always keep the wipe box full, which isn't always realistic for a moms and dads.  I am returning mine to the store.  :
I always buy the same size and type of overalls and this is the first time ordering this pair from Dickies.  They are very stiff and tight fitting.  They should have actually been baggy on me, being the size that they were
I have this product working in my hair right now. It is simply wonderful!  ---  --- First off, it smells like lovely Victorian rosebud-almond pudding. It has a similar consistency. I can get about three to four uses from each container and I have very thick hair.  ---  --- My hair was preciously quite dry and abused. I had dyed it twice in the last six months. After ONE use of this product my hair felt better than it had in YEARS. Silky, strong and shiny. I love this product! I highly recommend it.
A very gentle undereye cream.  I have used other name brands which extensively irritated my eyes and made them tear all the time.  This one is definitely a keeper
After playing this game for 16 days, (I finally finished it after 91 hours of game play), I now understand why this game won over 40 game of the year awards, it is just-that-good! Try not to breeze your way right through it though, or you'll miss a lot of the wonderful things that this game can bring to your gaming experience. Take your time, and enjoy it. Not your average type of game where you just mash the button to attack an enemy, this game requires you to think befor you do things. It really is a fun game to play. And overall, that's what playing games are all about... having fun!
The crib tent did not fit our crib.  It's not deep enough or long enough. I called to try and send it back and they do not allow this item to be returned. I am very disatisfied with this company and the product.
am very pleased with my purchase, speedy shipping will use agai
If you purchase this lens adapter for the Xacti HD1A, you will not be able to take still photos using the built in flash. The adapter blocks the flash and causes black shadows in the bottom half of your photos
This is really a nice product for staying fresh and clean-feeling during long flights
Alec Baldwin has always been the best host of SNL (along with Walken and Spacey) and this makes a pretty good case why. ---  --- The opening sketch with the press conference about Prince Charles is priceless.  And what could be more demented than "Canteen Boy."  Baldwin is so over-the-top in that that what is a really, really sick joke is actually funny. ---  --- But the home runs come with three of the funniest sketches of all time: The Tony Bennet Show (I was seizing during this one), The Joe Pesci Show (with Baldwin doing DeNiro) and the "Zinger" sketch, which just got funnier as it went along.  Even better was the voicemail sketch where he keep re-recording his greeting, only to listen back to it and hear a gay man. ---  --- There are a couple of clunkers: "Planet Truth" was just not that funny and maybe two others didn't need to be here.  Including one so-so opening monologue that probably was only included because it included Paul McCartney. ---  --- The bonus features include one great sketch that never made it on-air, and a great audio track by Baldwin and the Producer of SNL which provides lots of really, really entertaining stories about the cast and the sketches themselves. ---  --- Absolutely hilarious
This is a great sterilizer, it's chamber is big enough to holder 4 to 5 bottles wide neck bottles and the tray can hold quite a few nipples and cap rings.  I bought it when my son was born and after a year, I'm still using it.  It works great, saves time, and has an auto shut-off function when the steaming cycle is complete.
I received my new Fossil watch just a few weeks ago.  At first, I was pleased with the watch.  The overall appearance is nice, its very dainty with a thin band.  The green dial is a pale lime green, not too bright.  Everything was going good until yesterday when I noticed the watch seemed to have stopped working (and this is only after 2 weeks of having it!!).  I reset the time and it started ticking again, so I thought it was just a fluke.  Now it is working sometimes but is generally running slow (the time keeps falling farther behind).  If this is a battery problem already I am very disappointed that amazon would send out a new watch with an old battery.  I expect to take this up with them, as obtaining a new battery isn't very easy because there isn't a fossil store nearby.  In the manual it says to mail in the watch for a new battery, which costs $15!!  How inconvenient.  I am not impressed
I ordered 1 for my twin bed to try out.  Loved it, so I ordered a full and kingsize too!  I find I don't move around as much as I used to.  A more restfull sleep
     Sorry to say I found this nail polish remover to be extremely drying, something I haven't experienced with other removers. ---  ---      In addition, it takes several applications to successfully remove just one coat of polish.   ---  ---       On the plus side, it's fragrance free and reasonable in price
i like clinique a lot i needed powder so i got it, in beige..i also like the double pressed powder for even more coverage..fast shippin
I was making a wedding cake and the bride wanted passion fruit mousse between the layers.I said no problem. Then I tried to locate passion fruit puree in my area(Sacramento).Couldn't find it. Thank goodness for The Perfect Puree of Napa Valley. The passion fruit puree came frozen, thawed beautifuly,and tasted fantastic.What a great product
Followed all directions, added fish, within hours the fish were "sleeping" on the bottom of the tank. Luckily they had not entered the never ending sleep so I took them out putting them in a bowl of water and after an hour they started getting better.  Changed the water in the tank this time using distilled water, added fish, 3 hours later they were lying motionless on the bottom.  took them out and put them in another bowl of water and they got better. Something is seriously wrong with this tank.  Bought regular plastic tank at the pet store added fish and guess what... they are doing great!  Do not put fish in the shark tank.  They will die
Who would sell an r/c toy car that runs backwards continuously?  It was a big disappointment for my granddaughter.  Tyco's Lighting McQueen was greeted with glee when it was unwrapped, and found its way to the trash with the day's wrapping paper.  POS
I have used OneNote 2003 for a couple of years now, and it is a fantastic program.  OneNote 2007 is a very nice upgrade.  It is extremely versatile and works with a variety of organizational styles.  I have gone nearly paperless for my projects.  I can pull in emails, web pages, graphics, scanned documents, MS Office (and other) documents, screen clippings (a OneNote feature), Excel tables, links to files and web sites, etc. OneNote 2007 adds a a better, more intuitive interface, and integrates better with Outlook (e.g., the tasks work together better) and other Office programs.  (Note:  I sue Outlook 2003 at work and Outlook 2007 at home, and OneNote seems to work fine with both).  It also integrates better with Windows Mobile Smartphones and PDAs.  OneNote2007 has a Mobile OneNote component that allows you to take notes on your PDA/Smratphone, and sync them with "Unfiled Notes" tab in OneNote. ---  --- A great program that is sure to catch major traction in the coming years
I bought this camera 3 months ago and have used it a few times. Last week all of a sudden the pictures look out of focus and over-exposed. I haven't changed anything or done anything. I have no idea what's wrong with the camera, but given the price I'm pretty annoyed and Amazon.com will not refund my money because it has been over 30 days
Both our son and his wife and myself are very pleased with the undershirts. It was very difficult to find the shirts that openned on the side, so I appreciate them being offered on your site and will remember the brand in the future.
This book is an excellent guide to building and managing an investment portfolio.   It doesn't promise that you'll make millions. . . but it does provide the principles and strategies you need to create an investment portfolio for long-term growth. It's intelligent, easy to understand, and practical. 
This has been a great tool in helping my kids understand why they should not eat junk!  Highly recommended
I hate all kinds of onions I don't want to have stank breath. The taste of those vegtables don't even taste right. I wish God never made onions
these ramps work well with my lowrider saturn,i can get up on them without scraping the spoiler,extremely light.a major improvement over the old metal ramps i used as a kid
I purchased this for my daughter since I had already had purchased one for myself.  The pictures are clear and crisp.  If I had to buy another I would purchase the same
Polarizing filters are used to eliminate glare on non-metallic surfaces like glass or water. They can also be used to increase the contrast and color saturation of your image. I use my polarizer not only to eliminate glare, but also to make skies a nice shade of blue or to get some "pop" out of clouds.  ---  --- There are so many options to consider when purchasing the Polarizing filter for your needs. For instance, linear vs. circular, film or digital versions, or quality vs. price.  ---  --- If you are making use of a TTL or auto-focusing system, Circular Polarizers are designed to work with those features. Linear Polarizers has their uses, but they are manufactured differently and may not work. Unless you are certain, just get a Circular Polarizing filter.  ---  --- There are some digital circular polarizers on the market. I am not sure what makes a cir-pl lens better for digital as opposed to film. I use a Canon 20D Digital SLR and see no problems caused by using a supposed non-digital filter on a digital camera.  ---  --- Most of the time, when it comes to filters; you get what you pay for. Does that mean you need an expensive polarizer? Of course not, just be sure to get the right filter for your needs. What ever polarizing filter you get, make sure it is color neutral to prevent unwanted tinting. Spending more on a color balanced filter will save time in post. If you need multiple filter sizes, consider saving money by using step down rings.  ---  --- Currently I use the Hoya Pro1 filters, as the Canon polarizing filters I previously owned were without question bulkier and heavier. The weight might not seem like much, but when you stick all your items in a backpack all the extra bits of weight add up quickly. I can spend a good amount of time with my equipment on my back so this is a big concern for me. When it came down to the images, at times I would see a browning tint on my photos. The tint is easy to clean up in Photoshop CS2, but I don't see that problem with the Hoya Pro1 filter.  ---  --- Overall, I would recommend against the Canon polarizing filters. I originally thought, "it is Canon, it must be quality." Since then I have replaced all my Canon filters. This filter works, but comes at a cost of disadvantages to other similarly priced filters.  ---  --- PROS:  --- Can be used for film or digital cameras  --- Eliminates internal reflections and ghosting  ---  --- CONS:  --- Bulky and heavy  --- Not neutral color balance
When John Grisham introduced us to Bendini, Lambert & Locke, a Memphis tax boutique controlled by the Mafia, the idea of an in-house firm for the mob was hilarious. These days no one, least of all our hero Scott Finn, is particularly sure that organized crime doesn't just control the firm, but also the governor's office, the US Attorneys Office and the Boston PD. ---  --- Finn, who worked and fought his way out of the streets of Southie to the thick-pile carpets of Boston's Brahmin legal establishment, finds himself back among the thugs and characters of the world he thought he left behind.  When a fellow associate and friend with benefits is killed by a copycat killer seeking to emulate "Little Jack" who was terrorizing the city Finn is drawn into the fray, where he acquits himself brilliantly while maintaining his place on the partnership track. ---  --- Finn even finds a new love interest in the cop who is trying, though not very hard, to put him away. And a childhood friend proves an invaluable ally as Finn attempts to clear himself and clean up the city in the process. ---  --- If it seems over the top, it is. But it is good fun too
I like these notebooks very much. The cover is very sturdy and the pages have a nice weight to them. The size is perfect for your back pocket or jacket. I use these books to jot down notes from meetings with clients. The small pocket in the rear of the book is handy for storing business cards
No brainer. ---  --- Easy to use. ---  --- Good value. --- 
I've heard lots of stories about people using beer on their hair and I will admit to trying it once. Cynthia Sylvia Stout is a much more pleasant experience with beer blended with fresh lemon juice, cognac oil and lemon oil. It looks a little like a chocolate syrup and I didn't think it had a very strong beer scent.  ---  --- Strangely enough, the scent sort of reminds me of freshly made whole wheat yeast dough (perhaps with a hint of lemon zest), which is currently baking in my bread baker. This is a very cleansing shampoo that you might want to use when your hair is misbehaving and needs a little shine and control. You may only need to shampoo once since this really cleans well the first time.  ---  --- Using this with the Veganese conditioner will leave your hair feeling super clean and not overly conditioned. If you want a deeper conditioning experience, try American Cream conditioner which is simply intoxicating. Please don't make me live without it!  ---  --- While I enjoyed using Cynthia Sylvia Stout shampoo, I still think my first love is Rehab shampoo (the scent of Rehab is divine). This shampoo did make my hair feel silky and soft so I'll definitely buy it again.  ---  --- ~The Rebecca Review 
Most waterproof mascaras are designed to come off with an oil-based remover.  Stupid idea;   our skin has oil in it.  After a couple hours we end up with "racoon" eyes."  DOH, who needs that?  Mirenesse mascara only comes off with soap AND water, in combination.  Better living through chemistry!  Since I happen to be one of those people with a little extra oil in their skin in adulthood, I especially appreciate this fact, plus they make it in Brown/black  I'm a redhead, and am so sick of   searching for something other than black-black mascara!  It is simply too dark if you are not a brunette or blonde.  I need something with some brown in it, and this mascara fits the bill, perfectly.  For those who find it too clumpy, well, learn how to apply mascara--tweens!  This mascara goes on best with one coat, so make your first application count.  You don't need a second coat.  It won't look good, so do one coat, period.  If you can't get it right the first time, you need some practice and a mirror with a higher magnification.  If you think you need more mascara than that, think again.  Unless you are walking Sunset
The amazing thing about commentaries is that you get to discover things you never thought you would, for instance... why the screenwriter used the title  DEAD AGAIN: its based on a story he read about a woman saying she was pregnant with her reincarnated husband. --- Anyways, enough of trivia. --- This film is a great ride.Branagh is so skilled in acting and crafting of film, theatre  etc, that he had to come into mainstream films at some stage. So, he was working hard in theatre, and he ( and his wife) discover a script about a murder that gives rise to events recurring years later. --- This film's  cast is superb. If you listen to Kenneth Branagh's  commentary, you will discover the most amazing connections. And throughout, they talk of this as a noir  film, well, I have no idea what that is, but this film is a great entertaining piece, and it is in no small part to Branagh, Emma Thompson, Derek Jacobi ( brought in 3 days  before he was asked to start, a last minute call), and others who made a wonderful film, and a solid entertaining piece. --- The DVD  extras are just the commentaries, but for this  type of film, thats fine, since that is complex  enough. --- ENJO
I ordered several of these for gifts for my family.  It is one of the "forever" books to keep for the rest of your life. 
First, I've bought the magazine just about every months (for 6 months) but I liked it so much that I've decided to subscribe for it. --- If you are into the shabby, cottage, romantic home decoration then you gonna love it! --- I must tell you that the pictures are sooo inspirational, that when I put the magazine down I can't resist the urge to decorate and come up with great ideas! However these fabulous homes/shops futured in the magazine look very expensive, cost lots of bucks to put together! If you have planty of $$, then it's not a problem but the average person doesn't. So that's the time to get creative! I'd say get the decorator books out too, that will help!  --- Personally I dont' pay too much attention for the articles since about 80% of the time the Shop/Home owners only talking about how much they like to live/work in their great romantic cottage environment, which designer helpd them to get the look or which part of Europe they flew to purchase that chandalier and so on...but not a word of advice about decorating! --- The other 20% of the time you get designers, or other people talking about THE look, etc. that is useful. There's also a great list of websides at the back of the magazine where you can shop on line or at one of the first pages quite often a few beutiful object futured (sometimes it's even affordable)! --- There are not too many adds here, like in other magazines that sometimes you can't find the end of the article..so that's a big + too!
The computer I have now(about 500 Mhz)is faster than my last one, and the earlier version of Plus! worked well with my older model. However, my current model can't process most of the programs available, so I just deleted the whole package. I intend to get a faster computer in the near future, and will use SuperPack at that time. The features look pretty cool, but I can't give it a favorable rating at this time. However, when I see how it would work with a faster processor, I may re-rate my review
I spent 3 hours putting this thing together.  All the parts were there and it all fit together okay.  After I finished I noticed that it seemed small for my Deck.  I bought this unit becuase it says it measures 11'8" square.  Well it actually measures 9'8" square.  So, now I have to take it down box it up and start again
This unit is simply stunning: a beautiful, harmonic, warm rounded overdrive sound.  Way better than any of the Boss boxes, check out the sound on the Dan Electro website. ---  --- I bought this based on sound not price, but that makes it all the sweeter
One earring was damaged and instead of replacing it as I requested, they "fixed" it.  ---  --- I will not be using Amazon to purchase jewelry anytime soon ---  --- 
I bought this recharger kit specifically for a Sandisk m230 mp3 player.  When I first received the kit, I charged all of the batteries.  Upon first use I only got 7min. out of each battery, when I got 20 hrs. from the batter sent with the player.  I learned online that the batteries still have their charge, but due to the battery's "memory effect" or "voltage depression," my player thinks the batteries have lost their charge after only 7min.   ---  --- If you are buying batteries for an electronic device that detects how much "juice" is left in a battery, do not buy this kit
Please advise me if I can get a new Plu in senor Temp wire plug in this item come in defective and dont work? Please advise ASAP  --- Thanks --- Walter Ga
These shoes are very comfortable, look great but I had a terrible problem with the "ruggedness" of these shoes.  I am an avid hiker and climber and bought these shoes for the reasons that Merrill is known for, ruggedness and great outdoor shoes.  After only owning these shoes for a month I noticed that the leather sides were cracking away from the sole.  This happened on both pairs of shoes and soon there was 2 holes in each pair.  The insides ripped from slipping them on and off.  I returned the pair to the store I bought them at and got a new pair.  The same problem happened.  These shoes are very cheap and very expensive.  Do not buy!  They look great but unless you are planning on displaying them only I would stay away from them
This camcorder has an excellent form factor and conveniently transfers clips to PC via USB. However, the camera picks up the sound of its own zoom and auto-focus, which makes the video unacceptable in my opinion. The clicking and whirring is louder than the level of normal conversation. ---  --- We returned the first unit that we got thinking that it may have been a production defect, but the second unit had the same problem. Apparently, according to the manual, this is "not a malfunction"
Kids played it one time and haven't touched it since.  Bought the extra tower attachment which was a complete waste of money. --- 
I have been using this shaver for 2 weeks now and have not had any problems with it. It is easy to use and clean I have only had to charge it once so far. Even though this is my first electric shaver, it is a good deal for the money. It doesn't shave as close as a razor but it's close. I would recommend it or give it as a gift. 
This was a great addition to the "Photography Basket" I made my grandson for Easter
Very solid, nice looking shelf, easy to assemble with good instructions and all required pieces included.  It's exactly as I expected it
We've seen several versions of Cinderella now and like this one the best. When my kids were smaller they liked the Disney version with the little mice but now they have thrown the Disney version out the window. I personally really liked the Julie Andrews B & W version due to the GREAT singing but my girls prefer and love watching this version while singing and dancing around the room as the DVD plays
We received this product for Christmas in 2005 and within two weeks the console broke. We contacted Schwinn immediately and was told we would receive a replacement console. It is now May 1st and the console we need is still on backorder --- 5 MONTHS!!!!! It is absolutely ridiciulous. I call each week and I get the same response. ---  --- Unfortunately, we should have contacted Amazon within the 30 day period to get reconciliation from Amazon. Lesson learned there. ---  --- The product when it was working was fine. But the pain since then is not worth it.  ---  --- I do not recommend this product
If you are looking for a great all around camera, this is it!  Our kids play sports and are in constant motion and the sports mode captures it all.  Also love the "Last 4" feature, gets some great action shots.  We had the Fuji 7000 before this and they have definately fixed the features that bugged me.  Love the new manual zoom (if you like 35mm lenses your like this) as well as the battery drain.  I used to have to replace batteries every day, now its more like once a week with the amount we use it.  My other favorite feature is the dual memory slots for those times where I forget to put it back in the camera after downloading!  So there is always one in there!.  The video comes out great and with the new manual lens you can zoom during video shots.  In general, without spending A LOT MORE, you get a great camera that keeps up with an active "picture happy" family
As was the case with the previous reviewer, I did not receive the item that was described.  It is not a Professional Outdoor Cooker but a Commercial grade cooker.  In addition, there are no baskets included.  This set-up might be fine for frying a turkey but would not work for frying fish without additional equipment.  What you'll get is what is shown in the picture - not what is described
This is a great "little" lunch box and I stress the word LITTLE. The way the bag is made if you put a medium or large bowl in it, when you carry it by the handle, you are carrying the bowl on it's side, which is ok if you are sure you secured the lids, but then when you go around the corner fast and it falls off the seat you start to wonder, did i really close the lid on the bowl right? sorry, i got of track there. Anyway, I use this daily and it does keep things cold and has two outer pockets that are great for utensils, napkins, gum and small things. Also, I have been using for over 3 months and it is quite durable. --- A great bag if you're only going to put a little yogurt, one or two little bowls (like no bigger than 9 oz) and a piece of fruit and maybe a sandwich if you don't mind it smushed. --- I'm actually shopping for a new bag now that is bigger to allow me to have cold drinks at work all day now that we are getting close to warmer weather
It is the coolest game about horses. It teaches the most important basic about caring for horses and riding horses. It is a bit confusing at the beginning and a little help from Mom or Dad should be welcome, even though my daughter found things that I did not, it's a team effort at the beginning. After that it's just very pleasurable, and can go on for ever. According to my daughter it is very addictive (!!) and she has already Dreamer and Lets ride. OK it's not high visual 3D as the others, but let's face it, a lot more entertaining. --- In all it is a real cool game, and worth the 5 stars. Perfect gift, and good for Mom and Dad also...
The subject provided a good historical perspective on Japan's Renaissance period, post civil wars and pre-westernization. In many respects Musashi, a Ronin represents Japan's search for an identity, a country ruled by military might in the form of the Shogun, yet keeping an Emperor who they revered as a god, a god without power. This Sword Saint was a man of great prowess with a sword of wood or of steel; he was also an artist, a lithographer and an author. Yet, he was masterless, masterless in a time when righteous was measured in a retainer's devotion to his master. He was his own master, in a time when Japan had no voice, serving all, without righteous. It would take an other two hundred and fifty years or so and a world war to release the spirit of the Samurai, that being honor amongst personal sacrifice a picture painted in the person of Miyamoto Musashi struggle for perfection and personal mastery of his profession, master of the sword
I recently have become more health conscious and am trying to eat more organic foods, staying away from hydrogenated oils, corn syrup, etc. You know, all the stuff that makes you fat:) This jerky is a great & healthy LowFat snack!! It tastes so amazing you'll never go back to any previously bought brand of jerky again..I LOVE Jerky and have tried many different brands..this jerky is well worth every penny and I'll keep coming back for more..thanks AMAZON for making it affordable
this magazine really gives you good info on piloting today
I wanted to buy this for my daughter. I wanted to combine a traditional record book with fill-ins with my new scrapbooking hobby. The outside is precious, but once you open it, the pages are like a black and white newspaper material, and they have no structure what so ever. The pages are boring and don't look very durable
Yes, I did feel a difference.  Benadryl is not effective for me so I was sceptical. I am glad I found this . I use for when I need to sleep in an unfamiliar place
Maybe I'm just not pro enough to realize the ways to put some more precise reports together, but that is the only snag in this otherwise capable product. ---  --- To accomplish the reports that I need, I am able to edit the Gantt chart view sufficiently to satisfy my purpose.  So, it gets the report done, just not as nicely as I had hoped. ---  --- Tracking work is made incredibly simple.  Rest assured you can manage a hefty project with this little piece of software
I think this is actually a very good OS. There are a lot of new features and Home Premium appears to be the best Vista OS for the money.  --- I purhased a new PC with this OS and have really found no compelling reason to upgrade to Ultimate for $150.  --- Only legitimate gripe concerns drivers for non-microsoft products. Not excatly sure why this is microsoft's problem though.  --- Regardless, this OS is the smart choice for a new PC for home use. Accept a minimum required graphics and audio card until suppliers catch up with this new OS. Then upgrade. Otherwise, wait till you need a new PC
It's just like you had in Europe or Latin America, and it they send it pretty quickly. As you probably know if you're ordering it, it's delicious for cooking/coffee uses and slightly nasty for everything else
People this is a brand new game out for the v-smile system.  Walmart has tuns of them in the store for 19.99!  Don't waste your money!  This store is lying!!!!
This tripod arrived on time and in good condition. However I have to put the "heavy duty" in quotations as this item is for amateurs mostly and is made of plastic as well. The weight you can put on it is limited. However it does the job well for the amateur photographer or videographer
INport, excellent job, I love the product and would highly recommend it to anyone.  I've had several hundred LPs sitting in boxes in the basement for years and now I'm rediscovering that music all over again as I transfer the LPs to the digital age.   ---  --- The quality of the transfer is very good (imo).  For example, I was playing back So. Central Rain (early REM) in ITunes and noticed that I had purchased the song on ITunes about a year ago.  Except for an opening click on the LP version, its very hard to tell the difference between the two. ---  --- My only minor negative (or really, feature request) would be for LPRipper to somehow integrate and automate song titles from the albums so that I don't have to type them all in. --- 
I got a hold of a Windows Vista Ultimate disk.  It gave the choice to install Home Basic, Home Premium, Business, or Ultimate.  I installed Vista Home Basic, because I only have 512 MB of RAM.  ---  --- Likes: --- I like the new wallpapers and the way it looks.  My Documents and My Music folder remind me of iTunes. ---  --- Dislikes: --- Don't like that my less than 6 month old HP printer doesn't work with Vista and my USB net link cable doesn't work with Vista.  When you install something screen slowly fades out and then a window comes up asking you if you want to run the program and trust it.  It's a little annoying because it forces you to stop what your doing and answer the question before you can continue.   ---  --- Verdict: --- I like it, but the incompatibility issues are enough for me to want to stick with XP. I wouldn't buy Home Basic.  If you really want Vista, buy a new computer with Vista preinstalled or install a trial version of Vista to make sure everything works.  I'm going back to XP, until HP releases Vista drivers for my printer. ---  --- I'll write reviews on Home Premium, Business, and/or Ultimate if I ever get more RAM. ---  --- My Computer --- 2.8 GHz Pentium D --- 512 MB RAM --- 128 MB Video Car
Kiplinger's Personal Finance is a worthy challenge to Money Magazine for a monthly dose of economic and investing trends, helpful financial tips, and - in KPF's case - a kind of populist advocacy for the little guy investor. ---  --- I came to KPF by way of the well-read hand-me-downs of one of Kiplinger Letters (for which, see elsewhere on [...]) that were pressed into my hands by my mother-in-law 25 years ago.  She probably thought that without I'd lead her daughter into the financial wilderness, where we would thirst and die in good romantic fashion.  ---  --- I eventually migrated up the Kiplinger food chain to the glossier KPF and have never left. ---  --- Much of the information provided by KPF (mutual fund and ETF results and the liek) are widely available. The same could be said of the investing advice (look for no-loads with low fees, diversify, don't bail under pressure). ---  --- Where KPF excels is in the short articles and tips, which have often prodded me to take money- and/or sanity-saving moves. Two fine recent examples: the articles in the September 2006 issue entitled 'Buy a 2006 car on sale?' and '5 things to ask about silk ties'.  Both of these articles provided solid input into two buying decisions I'm likely to make in the new year. What's more, the conclusions reached by these two authors are probably *not* the ones you'd anticipate. ---  --- In terms of marco-economic instincts, the Kiplinger Washington Editors run bullish, though not quite so much as Money's more cosmopolitan-posed writers. KPF won't lure you into buying quite as many fancy gentleman's toys either, a fact that is well observed by their authors, who tend to be mutual fund companies rather than designer suit or German auto makers. ---  --- Don't get me wrong, I read other financial rags and might not be as enthusiastic about KPF if it were my only source. But KPF's monthly arrival is still always welcomed, as it has been for years. It remains firmly entrenched in my top tier
My online shoe shopping tip: Buy a half size bigger than your normal size. --- If it's a little too big, you can always add inserts to achieve a better --- fit.  I also search the web for additional consumer reviews. ---  --- PROS: --- This pointy toed boot looks really sexy - A great bargain for 30 bucks! --- It's an easy to put on short boot.  --- (It goes up to the bottom of my calf - I'm 5'5) --- The leather is shiney and has a seamless look.   --- Stains will wipe right off. --- I'd recommend these with a nice pair of jeans or even for young --- professionals to wear with their slacks. --- Relatively comfortable.  I personally wouldn't wear them all day long. ---  --- CONS: --- Leather IS stiff.  Doesn't really bend with the leg when walking. --- I think that is what the previous negative review was referring to.   --- The inside of the shoe has a nicer softer leather. --- The zipper is not the best quality. ---  --- Hope this helps you make a better shopping decision! ---  --- * Or, you can always buy, try on and return.   --- If you choose the free shipping method and you want to return the item, --- you just have to go to the Returns section of the website and --- generate a return label.  Once Amazon receives it and processes it, --- they will give you your refund MINUS the shipping cost you saved --- when selecting "Free Shipping".   --- (It is usually less than 5 bucks and you can see the amount in "Your Account) ---  --- enjoy
Was not impressed.  Narrow scoped, personal reflections, applications limited.  I also read the male companion book Wild at heart and was also not impressed
I have been buying this brand of prescription goggles for at least 10 years. The price has been gradually coming down each year. I was surprised to find them so reasonably priced at Amazon of all places. These fit well, adjust easily and are extremely durable. I swim 6 days each week and I can easily get over a year of use from each pair. Typically the gaskets begin to deteriorate long before the lenses, when used daily outdoors in chlorinated pools. Keep them stored safely so the lenses don't scratch and rinse them in clear water after swimming and you'll be thoroughly satisfied with your purchase
I've purchased many of these products. I put this in my top three. Good refreshing lemonade with a nice raspberry flavor to give it that extra kick.
Intelligently written, beautifully illustrated and designed, this magazine is a must-read for beginning book collectors and veterans. It should be of interest also to non-collectors or accidental collectors who just happen to love books. Great features on authors and genres will interest many; succinct departments will help novice and experienced bibliophiles
Any easy to use, lightweight booster carseat. Highest scores from Consumer Reports made it our first choice.
Our hero,amoral in his love life, refusing to kick his unfaithful ex-wife to the curb, and making mystery solving boring, why continue? Parker can write like no one else, but his recent plots suggest the well may be dry
The shorts I bought came way over my belly button. Made me look like a funky old man. I returned them. Otherwise the sizing was good. ---  --- 
Acorn changed the sole of the slipper from a flat comfortable sole to an uncomfortable, rubbery, poor traction giving and painful sole.  I rather have cold feet then wear this slipper
Spend big bucks and hire The Boston Consulting Group to help you with your strategy . . . and what do you get?  Hardball answers that question indirectly through sharing classic strategies for achieving competitive and economic advantage employed by BCG clients. ---  --- As a result, I think this book will be most appealing to MBAs thinking about working for BCG and potential clients who want to get a sense of what the outcome might be like. ---  --- For those who are well read in business strategy, this book will be a disappointment.  It focuses on very little you haven't read or thought about many times before.  Skip this book if you are in this category. ---  --- The strategies discussed include overwhelming competitors with superior resources (Frito-Lay versus Eagle Snacks), adjusting to take advantage of what customers want more of (more variety and better delivery from Wausau Papers), threatening competitors' sources of profits (Japanese auto makers go after the Big 3's positions in minivans and SUVs in North America), copy and improve on better business models (Batesville Casket applies automotive manufacturing techniques), encourage your competitor to retreat (attack the bottom of the market first in low margin categories and move up), refocus your business model on one set of advantages (CarMax), acquire others to build your strengths while making competitors more vulnerable (Masonite International), and change the nature of competition (get to low-cost sourcing earlier than competitors, secure low-cost assets sooner and play the Wal-Mart card carefully).   ---  --- The overall metaphor for the book has its problems.  If you play to win, you are playing hardball.  Al Dunlap (author of Mean Business) was a hardball guy, but it didn't pay off at Sunbeam. ---  --- If I read past the words in the book, the concept they authors are advancing is one of being unrelenting in developing a strategy that creates a virtuous cycle of ever-expanding resources and advantages while creating a vicious cycle for competitors of ever-decreasing resources and advantages.  "Keep 'Em Down" would have been a more accurate title for the book. ---  --- You will find scant information in the book about newer types of strategies, new forms of technology and new business paradigms.  This book is about "rock 'em, sock 'em" competition among the industrial giants of the world.   ---  --- I worked as a consultant and later as a project manager at BCG in the early 1970s, and I was struck that the kinds of strategies and clients described here have changed almost not at all since then.  I do think Hardball better captures the classic BCG approach used in the early 1970s than any other book I have read published by the firm or its professional staff.  Bruce Henderson would be proud of you! ---  --- From my perspective, I graded the book down for slight inaccuracies in places such as underplaying the legal risks in these strategies (the authors seem to think scaring off competitors with "signaling" is pretty risk-free), misstating some of the cases (did GM really crush Ford's ability to get investment grade bonds by pushing for zero percent financing? -- it looks more like mutual suicide to me), and praising more than was due in some cases (the Japanese car companies were very late to come into North America with minivans and SUVs).  I also thought the metaphor got in the way of the message . . . rather than enhancing it.      
The magazine does have good information, but not for a child...it's more geared to an adult.  Watch out though!  They like to send you notices of collection if you do not renew the magazine when your subscription is up
As a young woman I was appauled by Gurian's lack of respect for --- women as human beings.What makes me the most furious is his  --- shadowy writing which can lead a young woman to think she is  --- only worth something if she squishes herself to allow the  --- boys and men to take the lead in life.The resounding message is --- girls and women are potentially inferior and cannot because of  --- our hormones make important contributions to society beyond  --- traditional roles.I don't remember ever being taken over by  --- hormones and rendered down to a emotional bundle of primative  --- chemical reactions he believes all females to be. --- I agree with posters about this bridge brain foolishness.Gurian --- is a master at twisting words around and you have to read his  --- books being mindfull of his tricks.His book is full of agenda.
This is a very nice leather bag.  It has two pockets in the front that the flap goes over.  The pockets do not close and I have found that you can lose things out of those pockets even with the flap closed.  That is the only problem I can see with this bag
I've been looking for a pair of headphones like this for years.  I've used these for 8 months now and wear them almost everyday.  I ride a motorcycle everyday and I never leave without these.  First, the comfort is exceptional.  Even with my helmet on, I never get uncomfortable with these in my ears.  I've ridden 400 miles at a time without any problems.  Even when I need a break from the music, I leave these in because they do such a great job of blocking wind and bike noise.  I've used several other brands of canal earphones and none have been comfortable - tolerable at best, but most are painful with a helmet on.  The "bulb" you see in the picture rests in the crook of your ear, so there is nothing extending past your ear to get crammed in deep.  Second, the sound quality is fantastic.  Great bass, mids, and highs.  I've heard things in my music I never knew was there and I can't wait to listen more.  I can't recommend these enough.  I've bought a pair for my brother and may have to buy a pair for my wife because she keeps taking mine
First, I want to defend this camera's lack of an LCD viewscreen--really unrealistic to expect something like that at this price point. ---  --- What's wrong with this camera is that it tries to do so many different things that it doesn't do the one thing it NEEDS to do well--i.e., take a picture with the push of a button. ---  --- This product would be much better if you took out all the settings (what kid needs different resolution settings on a cheap camera, for crying out loud?) and simply put in an auto-flash.  As it is, you must consult the manual, push the mode button until you find the correct symbol for the flash (which is NOT intuitive, so you'll need to carry the manual with you), press the shutter button to turn the flash on, wait for the little red light to come on, and THEN you can take a picture.  Then you shut it off or it goes off by itself after a very short period of inactivity, and the next time you want to take a picture you have to do it ALL OVER AGAIN! ---  --- Oh, and did I mention that it won't take a picture if there isn't enough light (there wasn't even in the brightest room in my house), so you MUST use the flash? ---  --- Clearly, the makers of this product did not test it on real children.  Heck, MY digital camera is easier to use than this!  We never even got to see the picture quality--after trying to get it to even take a picture, I knew this was going back to the store ASAP
This character Buckaroo Banzai played by Peter Weller is an incredible individual.  A well accomplished person who is half japanese, brain surgeon, scientist, martial artiste, and rock star.  He also knows how to ride a motorcycle. BB is backed up with a special hand picked team of men known as the" Blue Blazers".  In this episode they battle aliens from Planet 10 across the 8th Dimension.  John Lithgow stars as the demented Dr. Emilio Lizardo in one of his greatest roles.  Blue Blazer Regulars such as Perfect Tommy, Reno, Jersey, Rawhide, and Pinky Caruthers add to the amusement but Pacos is in Tibet. The characters are colorful.  As "another you", Ellen Barkin plays Penny Pretty who safeguards the overthruster.  Flaws with the script would be "Why would Orson Wells be giving the news during Halloween 1938 and changing it to H.G. Wells "War of the Worlds"?  I thought he did fiction like "Citizen Kane" not report news events of the era such as the tragedy of the Hindenburg Disaster for example.  Is Orson Wells related to H.G. Wells or Tom Cruise? The movie is entertaining.  We can see why Peter Weller today stars in documentaries on the History Channel.  I only wish there be re-issues of the "Kids From C.A.P.E.R."(Civilian Authority for the Protection of Everyone Regardless) Television Show originally aired back in 1975 and before they battled indians, the original "Ghostbusters" also '75 starting Larry Stork, Forrest Tucker, & Kong. The songtrack on these shows were great. BB & The Hong Kong Cavaliers are not The Monkeys. BB lacks a decent song track. At least we get to see the devote effort of saving mankind from world destruction armed only with slingshots, boyscout knives, and six shooters unlike today where Captain America can't even save himself or maybe it's because america is only doing a job we all know needs to be done.  The movie was put together well.  It is a classic.  Jeff Goldberg also appears in this film but I don't know why.  Anyway, "wherever you go, there you are"
This popcorn is rather bland. I purchased it because generally I like Newman's own brand and I liked the idea of Organic popcorn but it is flavorless. I would not buy again. 
 --- Cold weather will be with us for a while and nothing makes one feel warmer than being wrapped in a delicious flowery fragrance - that certainly is Chanel No. 22. It's a blend of white flowers that has resulted in a scent which is both sweetly innocent and sensuous.  ---  --- Continuing in their use of symbolism and numbers after the overwhelming success of Chanel No. 5, Coco Chanel and Ernest Beaux developed yet another fragrance, naming it No. 22 for the year it was presented.  ---  --- It may have been created in 1922 but it's as up to the minute as tomorrow, especially in the new spray. 
If you are a tinkerer or a professional mechanic this tool is a must have for owners of 96 or newer vehicles. Youre blind without this information and can only guess at what is going on with your car. I keep it in the trunk of my car so when ever the check engine light comes I know instantly what the problem is. ---  --- - tas
I bought this as a gift for a friend, and it was the perfect combination of brown leather for casual dress as well as the beautiful simplicity of silver to match classier wear.  Whether you're looking for something casual or more formal, this bracelet wraps it all into one
It's solid and heavy as a rock.....yet to see the purpose of this item defeated. --- Working great so far. It's just a bit heavy to handle at times
I got my first month(a horrible Green Day issue)and then nothing! Uh,what up? Its not that good of a magazine,I just want what I paid for
Incredible follow up to Rated R which I didn't think could be equaled and they did.  Flat out incredible songwriting, amazing vocal identity and muscianship at its best.  If you grew up in the 70's as I did and miss those albums that you would play constantly from beginning to end then this album is for you. "Go With The Flow" is one of the greatest rock singles of all time but you won't be skipping any songs on this disc. Baby Boomers rejoice, rock is back
i like this game i play it 4 times in a day with out stoppin
I like this album.  Its got a nice mix of old and new material.  Along with some live material.  Great to see PE still at it in this ever changing rap game
Spare me another movie about how the big bad Catholic Church makes life dull and arduous until everybody is rescued by a sexually liberated Mary Poppins. The film's agenda is all over it and Binoche's character is just too "practically perfect in every way." 
I've never had to use this product, and don't ever want to. But it's hefty enough to do the job. Keep it in your console box or velcro it close by. Not in the glove compart where you can't reach it when needed.  --- Price is right. I've ordered one for each member of my family. They say it's the best gift so far. I think that's because it's the thought that counts.
This Suduko handheld game was not user friendly. I returned it for a full refund
This book was so badly written that I just couldn't help writing my first review on Amazon. I NEVER bothered writting reviews. ---  --- While I fully respect the authors' decision in providing the book online under the Creative Commons license, and while I do not doubt the sincerity of their intentions, the book is a total f*ck up. And f*ck up is an understatement. ---  --- The book: --- 1) Is unorganized :- ---  --- I felt I was being bombarded by information from all directions. One moment I was getting ready to test a simple "hello world" module, and the other I'm suddenly faced with a some strange esoteric block diagram showing "how function calls and function pointers are used in a module to add new functionality to a running kernel." with strange function names that were not mentioned and do not get mentioned for the rest of the chapter. How the hell did I get here? It just pisses you off and breaks your thought process and leaves you clueless and frustrated. ---  --- 2) Is upside-down:- ---  --- I read chapter 3 (Char drivers) and I compare it to real device drivers and some things just don't match. The book seems very theoretical because the "real" device drivers call some other functions that are not mentioned at all. After digging in the kernel source files and googling the internet I realize that in the "real world" there is a whole driver-model and generic objects and what not. Reading the source code documentation and some online material I actually understand how the "real" drivers work. I still don't understand the stuff in the book. I start wondering whether there is any mention of the driver-model  and I find it in chapter 14 !!!!!!! The driver model seems, in my opinion, the first step to understanding how "real" drivers work and I find it after 14 chapters of utter nonsensce!! Not only that, the authors decide that "many driver authors can ignore the device model entirely" and "The complexity of the device model makes it hard to understand by starting with a high-level view"... surpisingly it was easier to understand from online sources and the source code documentation than trying to read chapter 2 in the book! ---  --- 3) Is sadistic:- ---  --- One thing I really hated was the carrot-and-stick approach the authors chose. First they give you a small tiny taste of a topic   which finally seems relevant and just when you feel you're about to reach somewhere, they do a complete u-turn and throw all kinds of irrelevant off-the-topic rubish that leaves you sorry you were so shamefull as to expect any better. You end up confused, annoyed, and duped. Like in chapter 2 when they presented the code for the "hello world" module. OK fine. Seems easy enough. You naturally assume that this is an invitation to write the same code yourself. HAHA WROONG! The book suddenly does a "make hello.c" without showing you the content of the makefile. It leaves you out to dry with your uncompilable-"hello.c" and goes on describing IN DETAIL seemingly random stuff. You are left wondering whether the makefile must have been something too obvious to bother noting down and you start wondering whether to try to create a simple makefile or continue reading the chapter "as-is". I chose the former. HAHAHA WROONG AGAAIIN! I ended up compiling my whole kernel source tree because of something they decide to mention only 7 sections later.(At least they mentioned it?!) ---  --- In summary.. I'd suggest you buy the book.. and (as "./Documentation/ManagementStyle" for another book says): "NOT read it. Burn it, it's a great symbolic gesture". ---  --- I don't think anyone could have done a better job at making a worse technical book. If you come across any online material that "recommends" this book, *QUICKLY* discard that material too .. without thinking. ---  --- This is a -5 stars book. It has affected me personally
It is all you could dream of in a art set.  Very organized and neat, I love being able to just get right to work.  I highly recomment this product for a level artist; it is a great bargain
Very convenient reading glasses. You could hang them on your neck when not using them, and not even notice they are there. They are very sturdy, and are flexible making them almost imposible to break. ---  --- Cons: Both sets I purchased I notice them to be on the narrow side. They sometimes can feel too tight to the side of your face.  --- The glasses are also not practicable to wear for a person with long hair, as the glasses would trap your hair against your face
The mask is WAY too tight, either that, or I just have an abnormally big head which I don't think I do.  It should be adjustable, and it's not.  Would not recommend this
These are really cute and a great alternative to the standard "Numbers and Letters" version of these foam tub toys. My 2 and 3-year old sons enjoy playing with them. No complaints here
All I have to say is great album
Initially the sensation made me giggle.  After a couple uses I got used to the process and have even changed my initial thoughts that the whole timing idea was silly.  My teeth feel cleaner, mouth fresher, and I'm hopeful that I will no longer get the "floss" lecture from my dental team. --- Now that's something to smile about! 
I bought this for my son's birthday last night since he is interested in music.  As I was wrapping it, I noticed half of the keys were stuck in the up position.  I took it out and managed to bang the keys back into place, wondering how many times I was going to have to do this.  I decided to test it once I fixed it because the toy just looked horribly cheap with very thin plastic keys (you can even see through them).  The dollar store has better toys than this.  The sound is horrible and uncontrollable.  The controls are worthless.  I'm returning it today, and good riddance
This tea tastes identical to the caffeinated kombucha, only it's decaf. Great and calming.  Price is great, too
I bought these not for my car, but to clean stainless steel in my kitchen, wash mirrors, that sort of thing. ---  --- I can honestly say I've bought just about every microfiber cloth out there, and none work as well as these. I can clean the stainless in my kitchen in minutes, with no streaks, no lint, just shine, and without using chemicals (just some white vinegar and rubbing alcohol in warm water.)  ---  --- I probably added a few years to my life with all the time I've saved with these cloths. I highly recommend them
This book started well, but fell flat in the middle. What little conflict there was in the beginning was resolved halfway through. Even the shooting incident couldn't manage to hold my interest because it was resolved so quickly. ---  --- Well, I didn't bother to finish it--I have limited time for reading, and I don't like to waste it. --- 
It's a useful tool. Combined with another Norton's products GHOST, you can easily perform PC maintanence using these tools
I hate to trash on an American Classic... but this was truly horrible.  I thought my son would like this due to the flying car.  It took hours of TORTURE to get to that scene.  Horrible, horrible film.  Mindless, drawn-out banter, and weak story line.  Our copy eventually broke (stepped on?) --- we felt SOOO lucky to have it gone.  "One Star" seems like a generous rating
This is a perfect example of false advertisement. If you're like the many that i've heard of trying to order a remote for the Playstation 2, Don't order this one unless you have a newer model. The picture shows an IR unit but it doesn't come with one. So save yourself the hassle and don't order this
I haven't received this product yet and I'm pretty upset about it. --- I've requested that someone contact me about this problem and I haven't been given an answer.  I think I'm deserving of some sort of discount or at least an answer.  ---  --- Where is the product I bought???
My 3 yr. old son use it everyday to brush his teeth and comb his hair.  He doesn't tip over and fall anymore like he did on the other step chair.  The babybjorn is a bit expensive.  I found a similar chair at Ikea for a fraction of the cost. 
This is a traditional telling of the life of Jesus, from before his birth to the resurrection. --- The cinematography is breathtaking, the color, the costuming, the writing aided by Carl Sandberg is flawless and inspired and the scene of Jesus weeping and then raising Lazarus from the dead is awe inspiring. It was this scene which motivated me to write this review. --- Rather than showing us a thunderous awakening from the dead within the tomb, Stevens has Jesus lift the hem of his toga and make the difficult climb up a rocky bluff, puffing all the way to the tomb on top of a hill. Once there, Jesus strikes a pose made popular by the style of Ivan Mestrovic and the French bronze sculptors of the mid twentieth century. When Jesus reaches the high tomb, Stevens and Sandberg compose a masterpiece of prayer to the God of life before Jesus calls out, "LAZARUS! COME FORTH!"  But in striking juxtaposition, Stevens pulls back the camera, hundreds of feet from the tomb showing Jesus, the Son of the Almighty, as a mere speck against the infinity of the countryside, let alone the universe, much as the fist fight between Charlton Heston and Gregory Peck in BIG COUNTRY, shows the scale of man to God's work. However, as Jesus calls-out Lazarus instead of seeing him rise, we see the wonderment, the bewilderment, the fear and love of men at the prospect of one man raising another from the abyss. We see in the crowd, as the camera dollies, rolls and scans, the faces of the believers, the unbelievers, the doubters and the ever faithful, their reactions to a man dead three days, reawakened by an act of God, brought forth by a human being, favored by God. --- How much more effective was this direction? Rather than a straw man of seeing the dead rise, we see instead how people like us would react to such a thing, the awe, the tears of joy, the fear, the love, the attempts to reconcile with reality, the unbelievable. There was no better way to show the spectacle and that scene alone is a must-see for an aspiring  artist or film director. My only complaint about the film is a nitpicky one, Jesus' (Max Von Sydow) hair is too short. --- If you believe, clap your hands, and even if you don't, its worth the 199 minutes of your time. I saw the film with friends when it came out in 1965 and own the VHS and DVD, and watched it with a group, one of which was a self-proclaimed atheist-he had tears in his eyes at the Lazarus scene. --- 4.75 Star
I've purchased this watch from mid-watch company- as you can see It's a fab casual watch and is worth the price. --- the service was great and on time, and I am very pleased with this purchase. --- thank you
This product only works properly if you have a phone line and are using skype.  Do not use this product if all you plan to use is skype, it does not react well to this scenario.  But, if you are looking for a way to get cheap long distance for your existing phone service this is a great device
I have used Tend Skin for around three years now for razor bumps on the bikini line. Before I started using it, I had tried everything else and resigned to the fact that I'd always be stuck with bumps along the bikini line. A friend of mine told me about Tend Skin and swore by it, so I bought a small bottle. It seemed like it was expensive, but that first bottle lasted well over 6 months. It does smell like alcohol at first but the smell goes away when it dries. As far as the other reviews on here, I've only had stinging when I used it IMMEDIATELY after shaving...I think b/c the pores were still open from the shower. For me, it's been a skin saver when I'd already given up the search. I hope that the negative reviews on here don't discourage people from trying it. Everyone's skin reacts somewhat differently. Of the millions of bottles of Tend Skin sold every year, I think the half dozen people on here who didn't like it are the few unhappy rarities, not the average who, like me, thank goodness it's around.
Wonderful for getting all of your trigger points in your back especially, but also in your neck and feet.  Your body feels so relaxed after using the TheraCane. 
This was a film I was anticipating becuase of the actors doing the voice over and the special effects.  As far as animated features go this was the biggest dissappointment.  The acting was good but Robin Williams did not receive as much screen time as Ewen McGreagor which meant it wasant as funny as it could have been.  But the major problem was the story.  Yes, it did have a good moral but the rest of the films story was weak, boring at times and just silly.  I would recommend Ice Age or Garfiled: The Movie rather than this film
This car charger does what it is spposed to do and the price is right
Had mine for almost 2 years now and it works great, I use it for my violin. My teacher has no problems with it. Easy to use and simple.
We used this remote to program a Sony AV-RM3000 remote, but we need more flexibility for our HTPC.  In hindsight, we should have bought a stand-alone IR unit and something like the Girder software.  Or, maybe just an IR wireless keyboard. ---  --- This is not a remote for those seeking flexibility, or those who like to customize their media experience.  This is an excellent remote for those who want out-of-the-box usability, and don't want to bother with customization.  It's well-built, and will be exactly what many mainstream users are looking for. ---  --- Pros:  Comfortable shape, sensible layout, high-quality feel, reasonably compatible with many programs ---  --- Cons:  Doesn't do absolutely everything in every compatible application, only four somewhat-programmable keys with limited option
The instruction manual in EQ2 is quite addiquate regardless of class. Things you are not sure of are learned as you go or you can post on numerous forums for answers. ---  --- Since there are stats on top of stats and such vast areas with tons and tons of resources and itesm to be had, this book helps you get an idea of the "where" and "what". As in where you may find X or what Y actually does and realated stats. Its a reference guide. But as this game is so dynamic, this book has a limited lifspan and as you develop in the world you will find it to be "old news" rather quickly
Great movie but CD not perfoming in the last few scenes.  It gets stuck or restarts itself.  Very frustrating and more frustrating to have to return new CD
This straightener is great for thin hair... but not for thick. I myself have very thick hair and this straightener usually leaves my hair looking frizzy and very poofy. The best hair straighteners out there are about 1" thick or less and they normally have glass plates. So if you have thick hair, spend a little more money on something with a lot more quality
I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 because their customer service (communication and such) have been very good. ---  --- I purchased this bracelet a few months ago and (a few days ago) had the unfortunate experience as the previous reviewer. I was taking it off and it snapped in the middle.   Once you could see the insides, it was obviously not pure Sterling Silver as the "materials" portion indicates.  I will be returning this item for a new one (already gave my girl a matching one) and may not even wear it at all... ---  --- *very disappointing
I bought these lounge chairs because of the other positive reviews I read on them.  I have to say that I am very happy with them too.  The color is a very nice antique color that matches the set we got a Costco a few years back.  I can't wait for those warm summer days and evenings to sit around the pool and enjoy lounging in these chairs.  They are not too heavy, so they will be easy to move around.  They are heavy enough that the the Santa Ana winds we have here in beautiful Southern California did not blow the chairs around at all.  I think the price for these is a very good price for the value and would recommend them.  I only wish you could pick your color for the material on the cushions.  The beige color matches what we have but is a little drab since our house and patio cover are the same color.  I see they sell replacement cushions in different colors, but it would be nice to have a choice in color when ordering the originals
We purchased the Mega ball and have made ice cream twice in 2 weeks. The kids think its great. It takes a good half hour or more, but worth it. Make sure you have a really good stiff plastic spatula for scraping the sides of the container, it can be hard to get off. Really easy to clean
I decided to get this office suite after using it recently. I've usually worked on Office 97 and 2000, but the 2003 version has some pretty cool features not found in the older versions. The feature that I really enjoy is the Pivot Report feature in MS Access, which wasn't in MS Access 2000. This is a truly great reporting feature. You can now use Access as a front-end to slice and dice data stored on data warehouses in Oracle, SQL Server, Sybase and other enterprise-type databases. If you're used to creating crosstab reports, you'll definitely like the Pivot Report feature. Crosstabs are limited to 2 dimensions but there's no limitation on the number of dimensions in Pivot Report. ---  --- To me, the main drawback is the price. (I did get mine at around $370 at J&R, which is a great price.) I figure I can upgrade this in about 5 years time, which works out to about $70 to $75 per year (assuming that I'll be paying about $370 to upgrade in 5 years time.) ---  --- A big positive is that this is the industry standard. So the work you put into learning the multiple new features of Word, Excel, MS Access is not wasted because you can reuse the same skills in another job. Your time will be well spent. Note that the software may seem bloated but the intelligent user is able to choose and pick the most useful and relevant features of each application and ignore the features that are not useful. Different features are useful to different people... ---  --- Another positive: Each product in Office Professional is fully programmable using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) which you can use to build custom programs. This very powerful feature is sometimes overlooked when shopping for Office suites. 
Off-hand, I can't think of a worse movie. (And I think Nicolas Cage has done some truly awesome work in other films--hey, he's making a buck, here.) That's all. 1/32 star, if possible
After just over a year, my lens jammed and the display read "e18".  So I was pretty upset to discover that this is an extremely common defect - and a defect that Canon refuses to admit.  Try Googling Canon S500 e18", and you'll see what I meant. ---  --- Don't buy it unless you want a very expensive paperweight
my door handle was to the left and therefore could not use although product said that this lever could be used on all lever handles--shipping costs were more than item purchased so it would cost me way too much to try to retur
These gloves should really be called "Simulation Leather". They are warm and comfortable but the outer layer is some kind of thin black plastic that looks like leather. ---  --- I wouldnt feel comfortable riding a Motorcycle with these, if you hit the pavent with them they'd probably just vaporize.
I purchased this speaker about four years ago to complement my Bose main speakers for my surround sound set up.  At that time, I felt the sound quality was pretty good but over the years as I listened to other center channels that other people had in their home theater set ups I came to realize that the Bose center speaker sound quality was not up to par.  So last year, I purchased a Polk center speaker and the improvement in sound quality is absolutely insane.  The Polk speaker which costs the same as the Bose ($199) was far and away the better product.  The sound is cleaner, crisper, sharper...it made watching movies much more enjoyable.   I couldn't believe what I had been missing out on all these years.  The only reason I purchased the Bose was to match my speakers but that was a mistake because the sound I have now with Polk center and Bose main is excellent.   Depending on who you ask, the center speaker is the most important speaker in a home entertainment audio system.  If that's true then I wouldn't recommend Bose because all you're doing is buying the name and not the sound quality and to me that's a waste of money.  I know because I made that mistake. 
A comedy featuring four sexy stars as representatives of Heaven (Fanny Ardant, Victoria Abril) and Hell (Gael Garcia Bernal, Penelope Cruz) battling over the soul of a Mexican boxer is promising, but this attempt at satire, full of symbolism (Hell is represented by English-speaking executives, for example), is clumsily executed, only rarely amusing, and the superb Fanny Ardant is not given anything to do.  What a waste! You'll be better off watching any of the other movies each of these stars has done for more talented directors.
I actually know where Trieste was before I read this book.  Unfortunately I have never visited the city.  I wanted to read this travel book about this famous city, but after a few chapters, I wondered where the book was going to.  After the final chapter, I still do not know what the author's intentions was with this book.  Perhaps I don't read too many travel books.  Obviously the city means a lot to the author, but she did not express it clearly in her writing.  I was scratching my head at the end, and wondering what I read. --- I learned a little about the city, but not in relation to the amount of time I spent reading this short book.  The city of James Joyce and Maximillian.  The imperial port of the Austo-Hungarian Empire.  The meeting point of Slav, German, and Latin Empires.  One of the ending points of the Iron Curtain.  This city breeds interest and yet the author took us on a round about journal that confuses the reader.  I am sure the author's other books are good, her last one was not the greatest. 
I loved this product.  My baby slept in it until she was able to turn over.  She resisted swaddling, and this was a good way for us to keep her feeling secure in the crib.  I agree with the other reviewer that you must be careful, particularly with tiny babies to position the velcro sides correctly so baby will not wiggle down. 
My 3 boys (ages 4, 7 and 9) love their lightsabers so the idea of a spring activated version was too hard to pass up.  Imagine the disappointment when the fragile spring/force action is only good for about 3 tries and then it falls apart with no way to get inside and fix it.  We have 3 of them (Darth Vader, Obi-wan and Luke Skywalker). Vader was done before 9am Christmas morning. The other two are hanging on by a thread and now the boys have to be "very gentle" when they load the saber. The worst part is that the light up feature is tied to the spring so it does nothing now.  These are not rough kids and it's just a matter of time before the other springs get jammed.  Stick with the original light up sabers and forget the force action. 
These wipes are very rough.  We bought these when our daughter was first born and I ended up not using them on her because she would scream everytime I used them.  If your baby has sensitive skin I would recommend the Huggies Newborn or the Huggies supreme wipes.  Wipe your face with one and you will see how scratchy they are.  Imagine how your baby's bottom feels afterward
Love that when amazon deletes all the reviews for a product! Well, this one used to have about 3 five-star ratings. I added my two cents- this product did nothing for me whatsoever. So, some people love it. I don't get it. And, it's pretty much the opposite of an anti-oxidant, so that doesn't make sense. I pointed this out in my review. Wonder if vendors have the choice to delete all reviews if they get one bad enough? ---  --- Also, it's listed at $45 on amazon as well. from the same supplier. huh
I tried this coffee on a whim. My husband and I really enjoy our single serve coffee maker. We easily use up an 18-pak in 2 to 3 days between the grown children and us. This coffee has very smooth taste and mildly strong in flavor. It is a very nice coffee that can be enjoyed daily
The glasses are well made but I found them awkward to use. They didn't fit comfortably and it took quite a bit of time to get them on. The gimmick sounded cool but didn't work well for me. Every head is different, so maybe they'll work better for you
These tops were cute, for my 7 & 10 year old neices.  How in the world did they justify putting a size 2x on these things? 
Thank you for sharing Laci and your story with me.  This book is superbly written and shares with the reader a Mother's love for her daughter and angst over her murder.  How tragic to lose Laci.  How disgusting & heartwrenching what you had to  endure since Laci went "missing".   ---  --- I highly recommend this book to all.  Beautifully written by a loving a mother
How did he have the time to write such a picture, to co-direct it, to act in it and after everything else to write its score?  Noel Coward's energies, always remarkable, were redoubled during the second World War, and it must have seemed like another excuse to show off his patriotism, which he wore like a second skin despite his slummy upbringing.  IN WHICH WE SERVE is still worth watching, but it's nowhere as appealing as either CAVALCADE or THIS HAPPY BREED, and its focus on the "life and death of a ship" (the HMS Torrin) is strangely monomaniacal, almost constructivist.  Over and over you see unattributed bare arms hammmering away, symbols of brute strength like something from a Soviet film.  The ship goes up.  The ship goes down.  A new ship rises out of the water.  And in between Coward tries his hardest to keep you interested in the lives of the men clinging to the lifeboat, till our interest settles on three--Bernard Miles as Hardy, with his striking, long, hatchet face and the deep voice that goes with it--he should have played Ichabod Crane--John Mills as Blake, a tiny little pipsqueak who's feisty in the standard Mickey Rooney-Jimmy Cagney manner, and Noel Coward himself as Captain Kinross, tranquil with class privilege and, in the background, his glamorous marriage to the ineffable Celia Johnson (so beautiful till she opens her mouth and those bits of teeth wobble around on her gums). ---  --- Hitchcok's LIFEBOAT had the same concentration on a handful of downed and wet actors playing nautical, but without Coward's complicated flashback structure.  Coward stalwarts Joyce Carey and Kay Walsh show up as the love interests for Miles and Mills respectively--Carey, in this movie and in BRIEF ENCOUNTER as well, treated very unusually for the 1940s as a woman not in her first youth, nor good-looking in any way, who's given nevertheless a fullblooded and physical romantic interest.  She must have kissed the ground every time Noel Coward walked on it.  Who else would have written such roles for her? ---  --- The movie is trying indeed when it goes "serious," and yet that's half the fun of it, seeing how often Coward plays the "race" card--"we are an island race" indeed.  I teared up, of course I did, during the Blitz as the V-1 rockets drop bomb after bomb on London households, leading to the death of several favorite characters, and again when Coward leads his naval boys into Dunkirk and out of it again with a panoply of half-nude British soldiers sipping tea or what looks like an enormous vat of Kool-Aid.  Outside of these scenes, however, the movie is marred by its agitprop and by David Lean's tiresomeness, in showing everything at such a glacial pace.   ---  --- PS, the film was shot by Ronald Neame who later became a director himself and whose "masterpiece," THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, sometimes seems like a shot by shot remake of the disaster sequences of IN WHICH WE SERVE
As one of the founding fathers of today's heavy metal rock music, Iron Butterfly has them power, drive, and sound that made them unique in the world of rock music. This live album serves as a testament to that fact. Eventhough the recordings of live concerts from the late 1960's through the mid 1980's was primative at best (by today's standards), this live recording of Iron Butterfly captures most of the groups best music durring their prime as a chart-topping group of that era. This is a "must-have" for all Iron Butterfly fans
Darren Aronofsky's movies are beautiful masterpieces. From "Pi" to "The Fountain", going through "Requiem For a Dream", they will forever stand as timeless jewels. So they are hard to top in any way, but Clint Mansell has been able to do it every single time, scoring each of them. ---  --- For "The Fountain", he teamed up once more with Kronos Quartet and had Scottish post-rock band Mogwai join in too, to produce a score that fits the movie like a glove, in a very organic way. The central theme to the movie is instrumented in a way that works fantastically well across all the time periods the movie encompasses. ---  --- The combination of the talents of Mansell, the Quartet and Mogwai yields a relatively dark, yet breathtaking musical piece that will stand the test of time much like the movie it was meant to score
It was just what I wanted - I wear this ring on my pinky finger and it looks perfect.  Color clarity and triquetra pattern are striking
I got to page 26 and gave up.  Lockes writings lack focus and are void of humour.  I read as much as I could with patience until it became clear this book was simply someone rambling on about nothing.  Save your money for something worth reading
the very day i received the armor abs 2, i used it, and all the bands came loose that same day. i see why it is so much cheaper than the 6 second ab
I was expecting a good thing after all the positive reviews.  It was even better than I'd hoped.  The first container was entirely devoted to fluffer nutters.  I had to fight my boyfriend for the second container and he could eat the real stuff if he wanted! ---  --- Once I was down to just a little fluff stuck to the sides of the container, I used strawberries (alright, and the occasional finger) to scrape the last of it out. ---  --- A great product is one thing, but this company has great customer service, too.  I called the store because I had a question about another one of their products.  They were extraordinarily helpful and friendly.  Even though they were very busy, I wasn't rushed off the phone.  They treated me like my business mattered a great deal to them.  This is a rare thing to find in today's corporate landscape where the customer is treated like the most unimportant cog in the machine
My wife purchased this toy box at our local Toys R Us.  It went together fine, but ours must have been factory defective because the entire thing smelled like WET PAINT.  In fact, we had to return the unit because the fumes were making our daughters cry whenever they went into their room. ---  --- Little Tykes makes this unit, but they were of no help when I called customer satisfaction.  They told me just to return it and that they've never heard of this problem.
This disc dates from Monk's early period before he achieved recognition and started to descend into a long series of formulaic recordings for Columbia. So it's valuable from that point of view. It's also a wonderful chance to hear him showcased without horns although the standard is perhaps not quite as high as the trio Blue Note recordings that immediately preceded it. The best tracks both from a musical and recording quality view point are an extended Blue Monk, which many consider the definitive version, and a lovely unaccompanied Just a Gigolo, which anticipates later solo masterpieces such as Alone in San Francisco. Sweet and Lovely is in a similarly reflective vein. Much of the rest of the album has a forceful, driving quality, with aggressive use of dissonance in places - even for Monk. A particular highlight is Monk tearing through These Foolish Things
This is a great pump for a mom who only needs to pump once or twice a day. Let down happens very quickly and I can get 3 oz. in 15 to 20 min. My baby is a month old and I use this pump so I can occasionally leave my baby with a sitter. Geat pump at a great price
I highly recommend Microsoft Digitial Image Suite 10 and the free GIMP programs for ALL of your digital imaging needs!!!  (...)  DIS 10 should be out now..
Baby is happy, eating well.  What better praise for a bottle nipple can be given?  Note: Fast flow is for age six months and up, the slow/medium flow nipples by Avent are just as good (just for younger babies
The ad and description clearly state that it includes both a receiver and transmitter.  I received only a receiver. This is false advertising and is patently illegal. They ought to be ashamed of themrselves
 This is a great movie full of adventure and excitement.  Pokemon 4 ever takes place  during the period of the time when Ash is in the Juto League.  In pokemon forever ash   must protect the beautiful pokemon celbi from the evil Iron Masked Marador of team rocket. ---  --- In this movie you get to she something you never got to  she before  Professor Oak as a little boy.  If you are 7 or older than this movie is fine for you.  If you are under 7   this movie may be to intense and violent for you to handle. ---  --- My favorite part in this movie is when Celebi  makes the twig monsters  and start destroying the forrest.  Attribute to toho who created Godzilla.  If you enjoy this you the other pokemon movies.  I also recomend Digmon the Movie.   ---  --- This movie also features a short chute little min movie called Pikchu's Pekaboo which should be fine for  kids age 7 an up
I wasn't expecting Disney, but I was less than thrilled by this feature.  I'm assuming there's a genera of animation produced in the mid 70's that took the whole 'stoner' heavy metal thing and ran with it.  Many many long drawn out scenes with rock music and psychedelic colors that did nothing for the story.   ---  --- I am an animation junkie and will watch anything and everything, but I couldn't get through this whole film
Wow there are so many parts of this movie i just simply did not remember. But still a great movie, especially with the deleted scenes. They are not up to scratch but i am not holding it against afterall the movie is 18 years old. But still allot of fun to watch
This magazine should really be titled "Better Living Through Buying Stuff." It's beautifully designed but during the course of my subscription, the only important thing I've learned is how to fold a sweater. I will not be renewing
I'm on child number 2 with this chair, and my complaints are the same.  1. They tray is way too high for an infant/young toddler to reach anything.  My son is 8 months old and he can barely see what is placed on top of the tray. --- 2.  It is a cleaning nightmare.  I am still finding food from my first born hidden in this chair!   ---  --- Good points: --- -pop off tray --- -divider that keeps them from slipping out --- -cool colors ---  --- I tried a friend's cheap Evenflo chair and I loved it 100 times better and it cost over 100 dollars less
This is a very uesful tool , easy to use and operate. --- slim body easy to handle and control --- long cable to use in and out of the vehicle --- Got the cable to download updates but nothing on the web site yet --- It could use a backlight hard to read sometimes --- Overall a good tool to have in your tool bo
If you do not have a mediocre-level understanding of Chinese, stay away from this product.  Rosetta Stone has a very unique approach that might work for children under the age of seven (the critical language learning years), but for every other beginner in the language the software is almost impossible to use.  The object of the "game" is to match a Mandarin phrase (said aloud and written in pinyin) to a poor, pixellated photo.  For example, in the first section of the first lesson, you are shown a ball, an airplane, an elephant and a horse.  A phrase will be read and you have to match it with the correct photo.  It gets much too complicated after that.  Basically, it's a pure guessing game for most of the time.  I gave this product a serious evaluation even after reading the plethora of poor reviews.  I thought the unique style was interesting enough to give a chance, but I feel as though I wasted hours and hours.  I can remember only two or three words from the entire experience.  Although I have spent fewer hours on Pimsleur's Mandarin audio lessons, I am able to recall many, many more words and phrases.  Although Pimsleur's isn't perfect, it's definitely the best choice for a beginner (along with a solid Chinese-English dictionary). ---  --- If you do not know well the basics of Mandarin, this software is completely useless.  Buy Pimsleur's instead
Product was recommended by my teacher, works just as he said it would
I was very disappointed with the Ironman Speed Jump Rope. It is made of cheap plastic and, even after a month of hanging from my 2nd floor banister with a weight on the end, it's still coiled and kinked. It's impossible to jump with it as you never know when one of the kinks will bump the bottom of your foot. I would not buy it again, even for the low price charged by Amazon
I have been trying to suppress my appetite for awhile. I took TrimSpa 32 and I think that it did better than this product. I have been taking it for a week, and along with that, I have been substituting a nutrition shake for breakfast and a salad for lunch, plus working out. Dinners are healthy about 5 days out of the week.  I've noticed NO change.  I am taking these to be able to eat significantly less and still work out.  I'm very hungry before lunch and when I get home I have to take a nap and can't work out until later in the evening. I really have noticed no change at all in my appetite or my energy level, which is really unfortunate
THe pants that I ordered for my size were very small. They weren't true to size at all. I would not recommend this item to anyone
I've been making holiday turkeys for over 30 years.  This year for the first time I used Turkey Perfect...and without a doubt this was the best, moistest, most flavorful turkey I've ever done.  I told a friend about this product; she called me to rave about her absolutely delicious turkey.  Even relatives who don't really like turkey went back for seconds...and thirds...  For the first time ever we had NO turkey leftovers this year
Excellent! I am thrilled about finally finding coffee that smells and tastes just like what you can get at good hotels and brasseries in Europe. I was previously buying Lavazza's SuperCrema, in whole bean format, because I had tried it at one of my favorite Italian restaurants in Beverly Hills and thought it was great. However, it would not turn out the same using my semi-automatic home espresso machine and my low-end grinder. Therefore, for those who do not own $12,000 fully automatic commercial espresso machines like that restuarant did, this coffee is a much better choice. The Caffee Espresso comes in perfectly ground cans ready for the home Espresso machine. The Italians at Lavazza definitely know what they're doing! --- Definitely buy this coffee and enjoy
This item was the best product that I ever bought! It really works. To blend 2 colors you have to put the tips of the marker into the chamber and twist the markers. You can also mix 3 colors or 4 too. It's worth the price.
Very pleased with performance; have used it before without  problems
It is really good enough for my need. --- I have no problems so far
Ive always stayed away from the flip/slider phones because Im good at breaking things...Ive had this one for almost six months and its still going strong.  The mini sd port is awesome
A lot of work when into making this cloth, excellent for cleaning lenses of all kinds: glasses, video and digital cameras, etc. If you care about your lenses health, this is the cloth to buy, congrats 3M
This is good and healthy. It is not too sweat and not too healthy tasty. It is just perfect for me.
I bought this for my four year old for Christmas.  The net was broken on the second use when my four year old lightly banged it on our car bumper.  A week later, his friend, also four, broke one of the sticks when taking a shot with the feather-weight plastic puck that comes with the set.  Don't waste your money. Even for little kids it's probably worth it to just go ahead and buy real equipment that will last.
for me, Happy has a subtley orange undertone and evokes a sense of vibrancy and youth. As with the signature female clinique scents, you don't need much to cause a stir and it always leaves a lingering, subtle trail of sophistication
I ordered this piece and the matching chairs.  I have waited since July for them to be available.  They became availabe in September, so I ordered them.  They kept moving the delivery date and then canceled the chairs - said they couldn't get them.  So I  had to cancel the sofa as well. Now I am stuck with 2 chaise lounges and a coffee table but no other furnitue!!
My 8-year old wanted a pirate ship for Christmas, which was a dilemma because all I could find were ships for toddlers or LEGO-related ships.  This one is fully assembled (PHEW!) and when he opened the box, he jumped for joy.  The 4 action figures have the sinister look an 8-yr old could appreciate.  The cannon really shoots and the hoist loads and unloads treasures.  My son found enough small removable parts on the ship (a parrot, tools, anchor, lamps) to keep him occupied for hours.  The whole ship is hard or molded plastic, including the sails.  I'm fairly confident it will hold up in many future battles.  I'm VERY happy with this ship, but I wouldn't recommend it to a toddler or a child who looses small objects
First of all I would like to say that I was very reluctant to buy a SONY camera. After doing a lot of research for my needs I ended up with Canon 800IS and Sony's new toy T100. Ofcourse canon has the best overall ratings for ever but I wanted a stylish looking camera for my needs. Sony T100 is the best looking camera I have seen. It's features are awesome compared to it's small size. You can take it everywhere. Big bright screen on the back clearly visible in bright sunlight. It takes good indoor pictures too. I tried to play with its settings for while and thought that camera was not good. But then the best feature of the camera made it a winner for me. The auto mode takes great pictures and no need to set anything. Sometimes changing auto ISO helped to reduce the graniness but to be very honest if you are not going to blow the image to larger sizes (which would be 99% of the time atleast for me) it won't make difference. Just Point and Shoot. You get a perfect image for viewing on computers. No complaints apart from optional docking station which costs about $80. 5x optical zoom is boon to me as 3x was merely zoom. Also zomming while taking movies makes this a small camcoder with 640x480 30fps shooting. ---  --- It doesn't have touch screen like T50 and so it's responsiveness is better. I would like it bit faster though. Also camera takes pictures at very fast rate and the first picture you take is less than 2 secs. ---  --- I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who can afford it. ---  --- 
I bought this for myself to play with (I'm 35) and after all the presents were opened and toys, video games, and everything were forgotten (about 4 hours after Christmas), this was the ongoing favorite of the season.  Everybody, younger (down to 8) and older (to 45) had a blast with this thing after a couple minutes coaching. It's already on everybodys wish lists for upcoming birthdays and such.  This is a GREAT present for 11-18 boy. Fair warning though, there will be some good spills on the fairly short, steep learning curve - helmets, knee pads, blah, blah, are a must (and a video camera!
I did order half size up because of other reviews and the length is perfect.  However, the unisex width is way too wide for me.  I have a pair of Ugg men's Ultimate and they are not as wide.   ---  --- Overall, I still think Uggs are a little better and more comfortable
It's quite a bit slower than version 7.  But it looks really good and the form designer has been improved by leaps and bounds
Don't buy this here - it is selling for $49.99 at Best Buy (bestbuy.com). Wait until they lower the price on Amazon
  It is a very attractive wall clock that keeps accurate time. It is easy to  ---   view from a distant.  It also made the time adjustment for day light saving        ---   time
We had been looking for a light-weight backpacking tent with enough room for two. That seems simple enough, unless you've actually been inside of some of the "two-person" tents. Some of the expedition tents meet the size requirements, but are too heavy to be considered backpacking tents. We have just used this tent for the first time, and we are so far pleased. Plenty of room inside for two adults with large sleeping mats and sleeping bags, and a bit of gear. A large vesitibule on each side provides plenty of room for packs. I believe this will be a great warm-weather tent, with all of the mesh. The night we used it, it dropped below freezing. We woke to a ceiling (rainfly) covered in ice (on the inside). Didn't really expect that, with all of the ventilation, but as it was ice, it didn't drip on us. I'll chalk this experience up to extreme conditions until we use it in warmer weather. One thing that I don't like, although thus far it has not been an issue, is a seam running through the middle of the floor. It has been taped and sealed at the factory, but I just don't like the looks of it. I will seal it again before spring use, and edit this report, as we are sure to end up in a downpour here in south Texas. The tent is in fact lightweight and roomy, and so far, I am pleased. I will amend this report after having enountered weather with it
For a good price of approximate $4.50 (as I recall) plus shipping, I ordered the Bargaincell- Brand New Ikross Retractable car cigarette lighter adapter.   It did not work.   I suppose I could have packaged it up and sent it back (at a cost to me) and probably received a replacement. But for the cost of the unit, it was not worth my time. I've resorted to using a standard car recharger
I will keep this review simple. ---  --- For the price this is an ok deal. ---  --- However: --- The bag is a bit bulky and has no belt loop. --- The battery charger is finicky and has below average build quality --- Batteries are generic rechargeables. ---  --- You are better off finding a bag that fits your needs perfectly and picking up a separate charger/batteries. It will wind up costing you less in the long run
Way beyond my expectations.  Exceptionally fine cotton, changes colors in the light, great fit, absolutely beautiful--great delivery.  Thanks so much
I bought several things from this seller and this was among my favorites. My husband loved the way I looked in it. I must admit I was not that sure I wanted to buy something like this online...mainly because I am extremely picky with the quality of the things I buy...and also because I tend to be between sizes. But I ordered size 34 and looked perfect on me. I am very pleased with this seller. The order was shipped promptly and arrived in very good condition..
This soap works well for sensitive skin.  Smells like Olive Oil but hey that's why they named it olive oil soap. 
As always, the Nancy Drew games do not disappoint.  Personally, I quite enjoyed driving around delivering telegrams, if for no other reason than to keep my cash flow going, and to tour the rest of the town.  I must admit, I was a bit confused as to why HerInteractive wouldn't have incorporated the Courthouse into the game for some purpose, but hey, it's nice to see they have a penchant for detail.  After all, what town doesn't have a Courthouse? heh. ---  --- Indeed, this game could have been designed to be twice as enduring (and there were several ways this could have been accomplished), but to be honest, enduring does not equate with endearing.  Every ND game has satisfied me on many levels, even if a few levels were left wanting. ---  --- I also enjoyed going back in time to 1930, albeit there were a few inconsistencies regarding what took place when, i.e., the turntable revolving the wrong way, et al. ...however, a good detective will notice these faux pas. ---  --- Like I say, there's rarely any disappointment when it comes to the Nancy Drew games.  One can only hope they continue to create these games indefintely.  My only gripe is that they come out with only two games a year.  My wish would be for four or five. :
I like pasta. And tomatoes are used in the sauce I put on pasta. So I like tomatoes
I've allways got tired trying to wipe out all the dirt from road, birds and any other dificult thing you can imagine. But with the Lehm Klay ( I've also bought Lehm Lube) the dirt goes fast and easy... you just apply it and you have it. It's a Must hav
The manufacturer apparently states this case is compatible with the Panasonic FZ1 (and by extension the FZ3 which has an identical body).  I bought it and can report that it is not compatible with the FZ1.  With just the lens cap on you have to jam it into the bag sideways and then wrestle with the camera to get it back out.  If you prefer to use the camera with the lens hood adapter on the camera can't fit in the bag at all.  There's also no padding to speak of with this case.  By comparison my Lowe case for my Canon EOS Elan provides a secure, padded repository and you can put the camera in lens down with the strap on top so the camera can easily be withdrawn again.   ---  --- Targus makes decent laptop cases, but they have a great deal to learn about camera cases apparently.   ---  --- Apparently it does fit some cameras, just not the Panasonic FZs. ---  --- Considering the product is made in China one should be able to expect a bit more at this price
Recieved my Orange Monster Last September. I have worn it every day. I like the look and design of this watch but unfortunatly this watch does not keep very accurate time. Often losing about five minutes a week. I have friends who also own the Black Monster and anonther Orange monster and they have the same complaint.  ---  --- If I was to buy another watch I would not buy this Seiko again
Wow, I have absolutely no problems with this headset whatsoever. Clear sound-great range-and most of all its gorgeous. Turns heads all over the place. Man I feel high tech with this thing on. I payed $30.00 off of ebay, but that was a rare deal. Still Amazons price cannot be beat. Buy it, youll love it
I recently bought this wheel at a local Game Crazy in anticipation of the upcoming release of Gran Turismo 4 and so far despite a few problems i've been satisfied with my purchase. ---  --- The Good ---  --- 1. Great compatibility with PS2 racing titles - it works with basically all PS1 and PS2 racing games - not just Nascar games (I've been using it primarily with Gran Turismo 3) --- 2. Easy control customization. --- 3. Feels good in your hands --- 4. Well made ---  --- The Bad ---  --- 1. I wish the adjustable lap rest could lock into place (sometimes it slips back in when your taking a tough corner) --- 2. While the pedals are well made do not use them on a carpeted surface - they slip. (Customize the wheel like i did, setting the gas and brake to L1 and R1 and dont even bother with the pedels unless you have a better surface for them) --- 3. The wheel allows customization of it's sensitivity but i wish it could get a little more sensitive then it can (more life like) ---  --- Overall it's a good solid purchase if you can't afford to drop a 150 bucks on something top of the line. It's definately alot better then using a controller on a racing game.
This is a very mediocre Knights Kingdom set.  There's not much of interest going on here, and the small castle suffers from lazy design. ---  --- The colorful Knights Of Morcia are back, once again fighting against Vladek, the black knight.  Two of the good knights make an appearance here (blue and purple), and we also get Vladek, a dark soldier, and a skeleton.  The minifigs are as charismatic as ever, each sporting his own unique expression.  Vladek and his henchman have that cute "I'm evil" Lego frown.  Our knights are outfitted with the usual accessories.  Swords and shields, and a black hatchet for the henchman. ---  --- The scene is a small mountainside castle that is home to a large scorpion monster.  The creature is constructed from a mixture of regular and Technic parts, and he has hinged pieces for an articulated tail and pincers.  The blue knight is accompanied by his horse, who has a cute mini-catapult strapped to his side. ---  --- The scorpion can fit into his den at the base of the castle, which has a front gate that can be raised and lowered.  High atop the tower is a mini-catapult and a thin boom crane with a small barred jail cell dangling precariously from it.  The rest of the castle is just walls, floors, and a staircase.  This castle is very fragile.  Mine fell apart several times while I was working on building it.  On the whole, the design just isn't all that great.  Handle with care, and play with care.  Colors are mostly black, dark gray, dark red, and brown.  This set has one of those nice walls with the barred window, and some signature Knights Kingdom battlement pieces. ---  --- This set works as an addition to Vladek's Dark Fortress.  On its own, it's stunningly less impressive.  The good news is that a savvy Lego Maniac can take the castle parts and build a better castle with them. ---  --- My verdict:  one thumb up for the scorpion monster (who can be added to your other Knights Kingdom adventures), one thumb down for the rest.  Could've been better.  My advice is to get Vladek's Dark Fortress.  It's more than worth the price of admission.  For those still hungering for more Knights Kingdom action after Vladek's fortress has been built and conquered, this set is better than nothing
James, you wrote: "Ben is weak, immature, a stalker, lazy, has bad taste in women and at 21 is unable to tell his parents no when they ask him to wear a scuba suit for their family friends. Wow! Revolutionary film-making...not!"   Yes, Ben was weak, immature, and had bad taste in women. His learning to overcome his weakness, immaturity, bad taste in women, and then defy his family and Elaine's family was his coming of age story.  That WAS the point of the movie.  It went right over your head!  The acting was dead on and the subject matter was shocker when it came out!  How could you not love this movie?  Maybe you need to grow up a little to see the value.  Watch it again in a few years.  I think you will change your low opinion of this great classic movie over time.     
but leaves a lot to be desired in practice.  Just get a small electric or hand crank food processor.  This is not worth your time
Although a few of the tracks seem inspired, it's mainly Mulligan going through the motions with Getz, with very little chemistry between them.  "Anything Goes" and "Scrapple From the Apple" are nice  enough but beyond that it's weak.  Mulligan himself didn't speak very  highly of the recording session, saying that he enjoyed his other dates  with Desmond, Webster, and Hodges, but mentioning that "Granz wanted  that session a lot more than I did."  Of course, it would be quite out  of the ordinary to hear anything but negative remarks about Stan Getz and  his sparkling personality.   Save your money and go buy the 2-disk reissue  of "Meets Ben Webster".  Or, if you don't have it already, the  seminal Pacific recordings with Chet Baker
I am not Jewish, but you don't have to be to enjoy these songs. This album happens to be one of my favourites of the Putumayo releases. A couple of the songs were instantly familiar to me even though I thought I knew none of the songs when I bought this album. Each and every song on here is wonderful...some are traditional folk songs while others are newer compositions. The 23 page booklet includes a 3 page history of Jewish music, and each artist has a page about them, including a photograph. I highly recommend this album to just about everyone. My husband is Arabic and he too loves these songs. Music truly is borderless
The pendant is striking, shiny, and great to look at.  The diameter of the pendant is the size that I expected and the necklace itself is adjustable so you can choose how high or low you want to wear it.  Great purchase, would buy it again
I took the TV out of the box, plugged it in and nothing.  After pushing the on/off switch repeatedly, it finally came on.  Picture and sound were terrific so I was very pleased.  Turned it off with the remote.  Of course, the TV wouldn't turn on again with either the remote or the switch.  Pushed the switch about 10 times and it finally came on.  I called Panasonic customer service who could not do anything to fix it by phone.  So now my new TV is in for a warranty repair less than 24 hours after I received it.  Talk about frustrating!!
I have tried many different sports bras and this one is truly wonderful
These are the best tasting lollipops you will ever have.  Because of my 2 year olds food allergies I discovered these and now her doctors office is purchasing them, even the hospital my husband works at.  These are allergy free and amazing!!!!!!!!
the kid who wrote the 5 star reveiw is wrong. he needs to go to preschool. first, the pagages arent free, if they didnt come w/the maker no one would buy it. second, this kid says it cant get any better, but it cant get any worse!!!! the 1 star reveiws say to go to mc donalds if you want a mc flurry, but dont go there and support them thats just what they want you to do so they can earn more money!! go to DQ or just make one yourself. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PEICE OF JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
While the flavor is unique, three of the five packets of nuts were rancid! To say I am disappointed is an understatement. Unfortunately, this is not the first time I have had problems with the freshness of food products purchased from Amazon.  ---  --- Now, one to the two non-rancid packets. I got through one in a few days, and I was working on the other ... them I realized I had a major head-fog, you know, like a hangover, but without having had anything to drink. I gave up the nuts & it went away. For me, that's a tell-tale sign of additives in food. Not a good choice for someone with chemical sensitivities.   ---  --- I purchased this on a SD recommendation. But it was a complete & utter waste of money for me. 
The boot is beautiful, but because my feet are wide they are uncomfortable to break in. The price is reasonable.  Hope to wear soon
I HAVE HAD THIS MOTOROLA V171 FOR A YEAR NOW AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. THE FEATURES ARE SO EASY TO UNDERSTAND. THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPS FOR NET 10 WIRELESS ARE VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND. THIS PHONE IS A NET 10 WIRELESS PHONE. NET 10 WIRELESS IS A SUBSIDIARY OF TRACFONE.  I WOULD THIS PHONE TO ANYBODY LOOKING FOR A PREPAID CELL PHONE PLAN. I LOVE IT BECAUSE ONLY FOR A LIMITED TIME YOU GET 300 MINUTES FREE UPON ACTIVATION OF YOUR PHONE. I WOULD ALSO STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT IF ANYBODY PURCHASES THIS MOTOROLA ACTIVATE IT ON [...] ITS A WHOLE LOT EASIER THAN CALLING
***** --- This Bedtime Tea from Yogi Tea is an caffeine-free herbal tea that is relaxing and a natural sleep aid. Bedtime Tea is made from organic licorice root, organic spearmint leaf, organic chamomile flower, organic skullcap leaf, organic cardamom seed, organic cinnamon bark, organic St. John's Wort leaf & flower, organic rose hips, natural orange flavor, valerian root extract, organic raspberry leaf, organic English lavender flower, stevia leaf, and passion flower extract. The taste is mild, delicious, herb-y, and very slightly sweet. It is subtle and lovely. ---  --- I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Bedtime Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make. ---  --- There is a warning on the box that this tea is not to be used during pregnancy or while nursing. If you are taking MAO inhibitors or other prescription drugs, you should consult your physician or health care professional before use. There are no other cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. ---  --- Best of all, it works...I love drinking it before bed to relax and drift off into blissful sleep. This is a great tea that I highly recommend. --- ****
I tried to use these to relieve the pain but they did not work for me. They were hot and of course they also showed right through any top I was wearing. I had too much company after having my baby to use these they required too much work and attention
Barry Levinson's Diner is a rich panoramic snapshot of a time, people and place that's treasured by those of us who lived through that period and had paralell experiences. He's a master of his craft and so are all that contributed to this work
She is so cute! I love the real hair, I've made loads of crazy designs. Also, I made a discovery, if you squeeze her tummy, she cries, falls asleep or says "I luv you mama"
Huge problems with the LCD screen, two cameras within one month after purchase showed the LCD "shattered." One has already been shipped for service and the other one will be going in tomorrow.  Sure it is easy to use and produces great pictures, but the LCD problem is a definite negative.
When I bought this, the other review wasn't posted yet. Now, please benefit from our two reviews. This thing is a total joke. Useless, too small (I have larger hotel samples). I too would like to return this, but I just don't have time before Christmas. Amazon should NOT offer this item. It is a complete let down, over priced and just a joke. No fooling
The product does everything they claim save one. It won't work inside  Windows XP (service pack 2). But it will work when you boot from the disk. That isn't a problem in my view. Therefore I have no complaints
I keep this frame on all day and night. The LCD backlight should last longer than 4 months but mine just burned out. --- The quality of the pictures are okay if viewed from a distance but the low res. is not good if viewing up close. ---  --- There is no external power controls or a remote so turning this unit on and off is a drag. Regular LCD backlights should last a few years even if it stays on all day and night. This one just lasted 4 months. So the image is almost non-existant now. In the glare, you can barely make out the image so it's still there but with no backlight so good as dead. ---  --- I would recommend a more expensive Philips ones. My friend has had it for about two years and it's still going. plus it's higher res and and has more controls such as a timer function and also can play video clips, which this one can't
The earrings arrived in a Jewelery box, so they would make a nice gift.  The earrings seem to be well made.  The post has a notch  to prevent loss of the back.  The ameythyst stone is so pretty---I've gotten a number of compliments on these earrings
We have in the past owned an In Step single jogger.  It wasn't perfect but it certainly met our needs.  It always needed to be tipped back to change direction and it rusted a little because we left it outside.  If we had stayed as an only child family it would have continued working but with the addition of another baby we decided to sell it.  After being in transition for over a year and now that the weather is warming up we decided to get a double jogger for strolling.  We purchased the In Step Run Around LTD 2 Jogging Stroller in hopes it would meet our new needs.  The problems of the single stroller seemed compounded in the double stroller.  My husband had no problem getting it together but complained about the cheap caliper style break... it doesn't stop the stroller and barely even slows it down.  It took him the same amount of time to work on the break as it took him to assemble the whole jogger.  After that we placed our three year old and our 18 month old in it for a test ride.  When placing them in we encountered our next problem... the seats even at the highest point are super reclined.  They wanted no part of laying back but instead were both utterly thrilled to sit far forward and mess with each other. As for the straps a six inch long safety label sewn to the webbing made it almost impossible to thread them through the front buckle. So off we set on our test drive.  It was really hard to push and almost impossible to turn.  After a while we figured out that letting the kids sit so far forward threw off the balance of the whole jogger.  The only way to make it partially work was to let out both seats to the fully reclined position, criss-cross the shoulder straps and constantly yell "Stay down kids...if you sit up one more time I'm going to sit in it and make you push me!"  Well we got home from our test run and my husband pulled out the cardboard box and with a resigned air began the job of taking it apart.  I don't recommend this item.  In all honesty our Radio Flyer Pathfinder Wagon does the job more effectivel
I've been using SpySweeper for 2 years now.  It generally does what it is supposed to do.  However, it was nearing time for me to renew.  SpySweeper becomes a huge, irritating nag when it comes time to renew.  Not only does the software bug you all the time, but Webroot sends out reminder e-mails too.  With 3 weeks left on my subscription, I decided to renew, mostly just to get rid of all the nagging.  Well, guess what? - the renewal process reset my expiration date.  Rather than giving me 3 weeks plus 1 year, the renewal starts immediately, and ends in exactly 1 year - which means, that I've been ripped off for 3 weeks of paid subscription.  Maybe Webroot thinks their users are too stupid to notice this deceptive practice of moving up renewal dates.  I've complained to them - and if they don't make amends, then I cannot recommend this product to anyone
My daughter loves this earring 'tree'. It looks great and is very practical as it holds multiple earrings
I just received two of these bra-less nursing nightgowns (sm), a robe (sm/m), and the two piece tank pj set (sm).  I'm almost nine months pregnant and have gained 50ish pounds and despite the other review about not fitting during pregnancy, it (and the other items) fits and stretches well while holding its shape.  I will wear this now and indefinitely after the baby comes: it's apparent that it will fit me well after baby too. --- The quality of the fabric is substantial enough to hold large (and engorging) breasts without the need for a bra.  It is strong but breathable, and not flimsy so it slightly smoothes out quirks of the pregnant body. --- The length is a little longer than most - it slightly covers my knees -  which is what I wanted so slit is nice to have for normal strides walking, easing out of bed, hiking up to use the washroom, etc. without tearing the seams.  --- As the description and the other review indicates, the cups can slide down for pumping or nursing. --- I'm very happy with the colors, design, and construction of all items.  Due to the volume of my order (directly from the [...] site, I received a high quality FREE minky dot chenille blanket that came rolled and ribboned in a nice tulle bag.  I would definitely get this for other expectant or new moms
i am very pleased with my purchase .The item came to me in 3 days via dhl in a new condition well packed and safe .Recomended for reasonable prices .
This is a great shaver.  If you are in the market for one, considered the Remington R-960.  I am of Afro-American descent and was very skeptical about buying a rotary we shaver.  I had always gotten excellent results using Remington shavers that were of the micro thin type to tackle the tough turf around my mug.  With its ergonomic design, it was very easy to manipulate the shaver around in tough areas.  I had considered purchasing that of another brand until I discovered that Remington makes one and now... I'm loving it
Ha ha ha hah ha hah!  That's Stirling laughing all the way to the bank.  Or at least I hope that's what he is doing.  But sadly I suspect he more likely feels his Wiccan/SCA/DnD-infused vision of a post-apocalyptic society is a reasonable, nay, likely path we'll follow should selective physical laws break down.  Quick!  Stop me!  I feel the need to wave my sword, sing a Gaelic song, and break out my cauldron!  The genre requires we make a leap of faith.  And as a fan of the genre, I do so willingly.  But having made the leap, it is annoying at best to be forced through this "Tolkein as faith" drivel.  But as I will likely read the entire series (remember, I love the genre) I have to hope that Stirling leans towards the "thanks for the buck buddy" and is himself laughing at us all.  But a picture is worth a thousand words and his mug on the inside cover tells me he believes this nonsense! ---  --- My recommendation?  Read the book.  Laugh a bit.  Maybe laugh a lot. But do this with the library's copy, not one you paid for
I've run my Panasonic KP-4A sharpener for nearly a decade, with nary a hitch. It chisels keen points quickly, with a little accompanying noise that wouldn't be disturbing in most situations. In fact, the pitch tells you when the sharpening is achieved. Seems unbreakable to me, as long as one does not force pencils downward--just hold them steady and in 5 seconds, the job's done. Its sleek, compact, cordless design works on any desktop
Product arrived as expected.  I've had the tooth brush for about a year now and I love it.  One complain I have is that the interior of the brush head can get pretty dirty.  It cleans up pretty well with a soak in warm water and bleach.  I have not tried soaking it in Oxyclean, that might work even better. 
Hey, BRRRRRUUUUUCCCE! ---  --- What's the deal? Just about every major Top 40 artist has had their catalogs sonically updated EXCEPT YOURS. ---  --- Why can we buy the "Tracks" editions, and get glorious HDCD-encoded sound, but "Town" sounds like it's coming out an AM radio? ---  --- OK, you did your best, but Dubya's back in the White House for the next four years, and Kerry's home in his underwear watching the Weather Channel. You should have plenty of time on your hands now... GET BUSY! ---  --- Let's see some remastering!
Since I also have a two year old, it has been so great to have this wrap.  I can go to the park with him and not have to leave the baby in a stoller and I can keep my hands free.  The best part is that my baby falls asleep in the wrap usually within five minutes.  If he is fussy and I don't really know why, it is so easy to put him in here and take the kids for a walk.  The only drawback is that it is a bit comebersome, so I wouldn't use it if I was only going to have it on for a few minutes.  This is such a great way to get the things done that you need to do while still staying close to your baby.  And the wide straps keep it from hurting my back at all
This is absolutely the best bottle on the market. After working in daycare and as a nanny, I had a preference for these.  Then after my sister had my nephew and used them I knew the minute I found out I was expecting that I would be using them too.   ---  --- The reason that I love these bottles so much is that they are very easy for baby to latch onto.  Most other bottles use very small nipples whereas these use a nipple that is quite large, more like a breast.  If you think about how a woman's body is made and really look at the nipples you will see what I mean.  Being able to latch on better allows them to eat better and have much less gas and spit up. ---  --- I also love how easy they are to warm up in a bottle warmer or crock pot.  Because they use the liner, the milk can heat up much quicker than a standard bottle with thick plastic - a very important thought at 3AM!!! ---  --- Some people think having to always by liners is costly an annoying.  But not really.  100 eight ounce liners will cost about $8 and will last about 2 to 2 1/2 weeks.  So not as bad as you might think.  (If this is truly an issue for you, consider the Advent bottles.  They also have relatively large nipples.  But because they do not use a liner, you cannot eliminate the air from the bottle and they take much longer to warm up.)  ---  --- 
This bag is very small. My Canon 20D fits nicely with a small lens, but you cannot fit more than one lens with the camera body. We kept the bag for informal use when we only need the body and one lens to avoid always having to carry a bulky bag
I have used both Paperport 8 and Paperport 9 Deluxe for over a year so I am qualified to report. ---  --- Both pieces of software have some form of severe incompatibility with Windows XP Pro.   ---  --- I cannot really get version 9 to operate.  Everytime I try its like cold molasses.  Click...wait....wait....wait...wait...and then lock up. ---  --- I'm very experienced.  I've been working with PCs since 1991.  Every other piece of software I've loaded works very well...except for Paperport 8 and 9. ---  --- In theory Paperport 9 should be fine because it converts all scans to PDF which is more or less a universal file format.  However theory is a lot better than reality. ---  --- Support is nonexistent from ScanSoft.  If you pay the $19.95 per incident, you still do not get a solution. ---  --- The ScanSoft forum is always either not working (another bad sign) or it's full of people complaining about the software and lack of support. ---  --- Unfortunately there are not a lot of alternatives, but doQments looks promising. ---  --- Avoid Paperport unless you have money and time to waste
hey, ---  --- I have been using Min shampoo on/off for about six months, and can no longer go off the stuff because when I do there is  dramtic difference. As far as the smell goes, I don't need to smell like a coconut or a Bloomingsdale, just make it pleasant or oderless and give texture and fullness to my hair. I don't think it smells medicated, (unlike reviogen) but just doesn't have too strong of an oder. If more people knew of this product more people would be happier with their hair.
This lens does ok at magnifying about 2x max.  On full zoom, the magnification was not as sharp as without the close-up lens
I recently ordered a Kodak camera from Amazon.com. With that I also ordered this battery & the camera bag. Everything was delivered as expected, EXCEPT the camera. Over 2 weeks later I was notified the camera is not available. Now I'm stuck with a battery & camera bag that I can't return because they came from another seller. The camera I bought from a different seller came with the bag & uses a different battery. Now I'm out the cost of the battery, the bag & the shipping charges! Thanks a lot
We looked at many TV stands to go with the Sony TV we were buying.  Only a few were worth considering, but finally decided to go with the Sony unit designed for our specific TV.  Am I glad we did!  It has hold downs to secure the TV and the cable straps at the rear are easy to use and make the installation clean and clear.  Very nicely designed, along with being good looking
My son received this as a christmas gift, and thoroughly enjoys it. This is not a regular DVD. It is designed to go with the "Read With Me DVD" system (a separate remote control that works with it on your TV). A previous reviewer was not aware of this, so it should not have received a bad review for consumer error
I absolutely adore Elle Decoration - as several other reviewers have noted, unfortunately, the American version can't compare.  The spaces are gorgeous, and infinitely more imaginative and vivacious.  All of my American magazines (with the exception of Interior Design) get ripped apart, with a few pages pulled out and the rest tossed - Elle Decoration always gets saved in its entirety. I highly recommend - these magazines are eye candy, and they are truly worth the extra cost of an import.
I have been using this for my face for over 10 years.  It is very inexpensive (especially compared to other cosmetic brands) and cleans well without irritating or drying the skin.  I also used it on my 3 kids.  It comes in handy on the changing table, especially when the wipes were not quite "wet" enough to do the job!  It is also great for any spot cleaning anywhere on the body without rinsing.  It can just be wiped off without leaving any residue.  It is very gentle, even for newborn's skin
I really enjoyed this movie however one of the more interesting parts of the movie was not fully developed.  Ian Mckellen's character was supposed to be homosexual .....he is in love with Vincent Perez's character.  It was a pretty subtle subplot in the movie and while I was watching it I was thinking....hmmmm is Ian Mckellen's character gay? I read Roger Ebert's review of the movie on [...]. In his article Ebert says the movie could have been more interesting if this plot was further developed....I agree. I really enjoyed the movie but I thought Ian Mckellen's character was very interesting and if his desires were further explored it could have turned this fairly ordinary romance movie into an extraordinary movie
Hi, I just wanted to let everyone out their know: that this stuff works.  ---  --- I have had problematic hormonal acne since the age of 21. I'm 27 now.  ---  --- After I graduated from the university and started working a real job, the stress went straight to my face (you all know what I am talking about). Unfortunately for me, I am allergic to benzyl peroxide and I have extremely sensitive skin. I also do not do well with tea tree oils and most sulfur and acidic products (basically anything that can kill acne - leaves my face itchy- either swollen like a tomato or is ineffective and I have painful acne bumps...which would you rather do?). ---  --- I was a little hesitant after reading the ingredients and noticed that the cleanser had sulfur in it and there was also a jar of pure salicylic acid for blemishes. But, after using other philosophy products for my hair and body - I decided to give it a try. Hell, what's another 50 bucks if it can clear my acne - and if not I can always send it back. ---  --- I started using it about 3 weeks ago and my skin has had a tremendous transformation. I finally feel like my acne is under control. I recommend this product fully and it is my duty to tell everyone this after suffering with relentless acne for so many years.  ---  --- The cleanser is awesome and needs to be in a larger size. The blemish serum is extremely drying, so if you are sensitive like me read the directions and take it slow - don't reapply throughout the day, until your skin is ready. The day and night face creams are cool. The day one is kind of like glue and seals in the treatment - the entire day! That's why it works, because it is on your face until night time when you wash (I can even faintly smell the product). Then you use your night hydrogen peroxide cream, yes not benzyl. Yeah, this cream is intense as well. So take it slow until your skin is ready.  ---  --- One thing that I do recommend is that if you wear make-up, use the purity cleanser (not in the kit) to initially clean your skin and then use the acne cleanser. That's what I do and it works for me - so I will share it with you. ---  --- Another thing I do is I will take a little bit of the hope is not enough SPF moisturizer and put on very little on my super dry areas. Remember this acne kit is intense and you may be prone to drying out and peeling - so some oil-free moisturizer can help hydrate the area around the acne. ---  --- Well that's about it. I hope this helps you and let's you know that your acne can be tamed and doesn't have to run your life.  ---  --- Take care, --- M. Rodriguez --- Surprise, AZ ---  ---  
This is actually a review for more than one product (Pimsleur and Rosetta Stone) ---  --- If you are willing to spend 1-2 years learning a foreign language but have limited time (weekly), lack the ability to immerse yourself in that culture for 1 year (the best way to learn the language), can't attend classes, can expend some budget, and want the process to be challenging yet fun, here's how to do it: ---  --- 1. Buy a good English-Foreign Language Dictionary. --- 2. Get the Pimsleur Course for that language. (Check Ebay for used copies) --- 3. Buy the Rosetta Stone Program for that language. (Costly. Try the online monthly subscription option if your budget is tight.) --- 4. Get a Basic Grammar Language Book (Barron's highly recommended) ---  --- Putting it all together. ---  --- 1. Listen to the Pimsleur Program during your daily commute-1 lesson per day. (Take the weekend off) DO NOT go to the next lesson until you have a 80% recall of the material. THERE IS NO NEED TO BE AT 100% RECALL before going to the next lesson. (Trust me on this on-avoid my pain) ---       Using this method, you can get through ALL Pimsleur lessons (Levels I-III)in 1 year. THE FOCUS OF PIMSLEUR IS SPEAKING SKILLS. ---  --- 2. At the same time, use the Rosetta Stone lessons on the weekend, with one 30 minute to 1 hour session. Go through the guided exercise followed by the test. THERE IS NO NEED TO GO THROUGH EVERY LESSON (TYPE) for each program. After you buy the product, you'll know what I'm talking about. THE FOCUS OF ROSETTA STONE IS LISTENING SKILLS.   ---  --- 3. Review the basic grammar of the language as you go through the 2 above. ---  --- 4. Contrary to what Pimsleur says, look up any words for spelling, and likewise, for Rosetta Stone, look up any words for definition you don't understand.  ---  --- Bottomline: Despite what they advertise, these are not stand-alone programs. Also the secret to recall is anticipation, meaning an 80% success rate for Pimsleur is ok and 70% success rate for Rosetta Stone is okay before moving to the next lesson.  ---  --- You don't get any extra points for making 100% and this effort can be counter-productive (burn out, boredom, and frustration before finishing the lessons.) ---  --- Your goal should be to get through all of the programs and lessons and the experience should be challenging and fun. Afterwards, you can take your trip to that country for the total immersion experience, and after the first 2 weeks, you'll see how well spent your time was with the programs.   ---  --- Note: I've used the Japanese, German, and Korean Pimsleur Courses, and Rosetta Stone German and Japanese Programs. I've also spent extensive time in all 3 of those countries. Learn from my mistakes. ---  --- Good luck and have fun.
What a wonderful game - addictive and motivating! If you want to be able to make original sentences, you might need something more in depth with a bit more grammar, but for "Eazy Speak" this is right on the target! Fun for any computer user! ---  --- Looking for Spanish curriculum for younger kids? Try Flip Flop Spanish which has a CD with the writable workbook
The gym is very easy to assemble, took me about 45 minutes on my own.  The book supplies several different workouts, hitting every major muscle group, and you get good resistance in every workout. You won't get great range of motion on all the workouts, there may be times when you'll need to lean back or put yourself in a different position in order to get a full stretch, but those are minor adjustments you'd probably have to make on any other type of equipment.  The gym itself is light, easy to move around the house, and doesn't take up much space. It may be too light, and not sturdy enough in some instances, and you will need to stand on the frame in the stand-up workouts.  --- The price is outstanding, at 180 dollars. You're not going to find a better deal than this, and the workout is very comparable to the far more expensive Bowflex
I used to like good charlotte, enough that i bought this CD, but i really don't like them at all anymore.  They try to look all punk, but they are pop.  They whine a lot.  I think it's time to get over the fact that their dad left and they were uncool.  they should at least stop doing songs about it.  They have some ok melodies and words, but for the most part all their songs sound the same.  Good Charlottes first two CD's were almost good, but this one is bad and really whiny
It was a gift and I was pleased with the good quality and workmanship
The code reader is a very good device with an excellent price. I fix my car and I saved money. The diagnostic for a car is almost 80 dollars in the auto repair shop, with that money I bought my own code reader
When I first got this camera, I was satisfied.  It is complicated to use (definitely not intuitive) because it does so much with so few buttons that you need to scroll through endless screens at time sto do what you want.  However, it took pretty good pictures.  However, soon after the warranty expired, it began to overexpose pictures and we couldn't stop it from doing that.  We tried to contact Fuji but have gotten no response.  My wife found that this is a common problem (overeposure and lack of response from Fuji), which is probably why they have a lot of refurbished ones to sell.  Hopefully, they have fixed the problem but I wouldn't bet my money on it.  This camera has given us more frustration than it is worth
The best part about my ijoy 130 is the price I paid.  Day after Xmas Linens and Things had only the floor model left.  Got 20% off of that plus signed up for the credit card to get another 10% off.  30% off made the chair $500 instead of $700.  I am in it as I write this!!!  Very nice and relaxing.  Sometimes the "percussion" setting is a little too hard in some spots but otherwise it's great.  I would agree that I wish it went a little further up the neck.  I just sit a little lower in the chair for it.  Not sure if it's worth $700 just because that's alot of money but I've got no problem with $500.  I think my wife and I will get alot of use out of it
The software is terrible, slow and glitchy. I have to start and close it multiple times to get it to find the player. The operators manual is just under 100 pages, so have fun learning the intricacies of the controls. Granted, the hardware is cute and the variety of functions is impressive--assuming you have sufficient spare time to study the manual.
Don't listen to the reviews that claim that this lens is not a good choice for cropped sensor cameras (IE the 20D, 30D, Rebels etc) the Canon L lens are the best and this particular lens is no exception. I have had the lens for less than 24 hours now and am in love with the sharpness and color already.  ---  --- Great lens, great color, so well built, super sharp, just watch out if this is your first L lens, you'll be hooked. ---  --- This is a lens you will have for many years, great investment
This is one of the truly great Handel opera recordings of the last twenty years. As usual, Nicholas McGegan proves himself to be one of the two or three greatest Handelian conductors of our time. The singing from beginning to end is first class. This opera is known for the famous largo "Ombra mai fu," but the music in this entire performance is a sheer delight
 --- Fast and easy to make, delicious to eat, and no sugar or fat !  Buying in quantity is economical and efficient
My family always enjoys Mini Wheats and this shipment was no exception. Everything was just as tasty as store-bought. I have recommended Amazon to family and friends. When I had a question, Amazon was right there to solve the problem.
Well I guess the title says most of it. I am not happy with them they turn a dark brown just walking across the yard so I have to put them in the washing machine with bleach A LOT. Then the place where the laces go at the top are all frayed. I've tried to was them by hand with bleach so it wont fry but it dosen't work they look the same as before. But they are comfortable I also like the high arch in them. They are pretty when they fist come out of the box but if you are planing on doing any outdoor actives I wouldn't recommend them
I came across this looking for angel pendants.  I bought this one and the matching earrings.  I absolutely love this pendant! Wear it all the time and always get compliments on it.  You can wear it year round! One of the earrings fell out of my ear the first time I wore it!  Wouldn't recommend those! But this winged pendants is beautiful
This is a heavy/thick robe, I expect it would fit a man 6' tall perfectly. I am 5'8" and the sleeves are only slightly to long but, I don't even notice now. The comfort level is amazing, this is so incredibly soft and warm you will put it on as soon as you get home and take it off when you go to bed. I cant speak on durability as I've only had it for a month or so but, you most likely will not be dissapointed with the feel. I got the brown color and I love it, I feel like grisly adams in this thing..
This necklace is beautiful.  The chain is not skimpy and the heart locket itself is really pretty.  A great alternative to an expensive locket at a fine jeweler.  A true steal at a sale price of under $30.00
This morning I spilled coffee on my "million dollar" white dress shirt.  It left me with three large coffer stains.  I remembered that I had my Tide To Go in the car.  After drenching the stains with the solution and rubbing them per the directions, most of the coffee stains had disappeared....what remained, however, were large coffee colored rings at the edges of where the solution had spread.  So, most of the coffee stain was gone, but I'm left with the unsightly rings...not quite as noticeable, but there're still there. ---  ---  ---  --- 
I am sooooo very happy that agave is now available in the large container.  This brand is the best of the agave. --- 
This product is great! Very refreshing. It tastes just like you are drinking it straight from a young coconut.  It doesn't have any added sugar & it's only 60 calories a serving.  I just wish it were cheaper...
Needs more shoulder buttons.  Other than that, is good
Was surprised by the price compared to other movies, but it was worth it
I was impatient to buy the successor of my beloved Treo 650, and did so last January by upgrading to the Treo 680. I have been a faithful customer of Palm technology since 1997, and for the first time, I am disappointed. Of course, I still have the friendly Palm OS, tailor made for smart phones. I also have upgrade compatibility for my 15,000 records stored in the Treo's four main applications. But the minuscule battery of the 680 forces me to curtail Versamail sync and phone conversations, and its clumsy command bar results in unexpected commands (contrary to the 650, buttons are too close to each other). Reliability of the 680 is also left to be desired, especially compared with the 650 after firmware update. Finally, I use Intellisync for dual sync with both user-friendly Palm Desktop and heavy duty email MS Outlook; the acquisition of Pumatech by Nokia results in a clumsy new release of Intellisync for Treo: Intellisync new version added a record number in the "note" field of all my records ! I quickly reverted to an older Intellisync version and I wonder what will happen when I need to upgrade with  MS Office 2007 compatibility... Nokia's low blow to Palm ? It is time Palm responds with a decent dual sync solution of their own. If not, it's decided: I will switch to the Pearl
As a complete newbie to XML this was a good starter.  As I got deeper into XML I found several mistakes/deficiencies in the book, and sometimes the author just flat out seemed to not know what he was talking about.  For instance, the claim on page 86 that (#CDATA) is a valid DTD element content definition is flat out wrong.  His description of Schema element declarations (pp. 114-115) teaches that using globals/refs is the only way to define complex elements, and is inappropriate for his example.  He makes no mention of globals at all, leaving the reader confused.  I have ceased to trust this book as a valid source of XML information
It seems that all previous Quickbook versions will not run on Windows Vista and I had upgraded my system. So, I bought Simple Start as the least expensive way to get a Quickbook product to run on Vista. Turns out Simple start runs fine on Vista BUT you cannot load a company file from earlier versions. Thus, Simple Start was simply useless to me. When I called Intuit customer service they said that for another $100 they'd give me a license number that would unlock that feature. By that time I was committed and had no choice. Talk about getting ripped off!!
As a novice astronomer I really enjoy the sharp, steady view with these binoculars. The view is fairly steady even with the I.S. off - depending how stable you are of course. My binoculars cost more than my telescope !! And my telescope is a decent one too. But I think they are worth it. You see so much more in the night sky than what the naked eye can see - by far. They are of course great during the day too. Their weight is not much of an issue for me, although each person is different depending on their viewing habits. I think a hard carry case would have been the best but it's not a big deal for my use. I recommend this pair of binoculars to anyone who is serious about great quality and performance
I use it with my Nikon D70, and am very satisfied with it. --- I most often use it for long exposures, for taking picture that include myself, and for taking pictures of my 6-month old daughter, who stops acting naturally when she notices I hold the camera, so I place it on the tripod, and take pictures of her.
This is perfect for the desktop.  It excels at destroying credit cards, DVDs, CDs and Floppy Disc.  In an emergency you can use it to shred paper, including staples. ---  --- Because DVDs, CDs and Floppy Disc are dense, they lay flat, and take up very little room in the debris basket.  Since paper is light, it will bunch up, filling the debris basket fast.  If you do a lot of paper, you want to consider a paper shredder with a larger basket. ---  --- Because it is shredding polycarbonate and metal, the feeder slot snuggly fits DVDs, CDs, and Floppy Discs.  This reduces the chance of high energy debris.  Do Not look into the slot while shredding.  Because of the snug slot, feeding paper into the MD100 is not quick.  If you want to shred less than 8 pages, but cannot leave your desk, you can use the MD100.  If you want to shred more than 8 pages, or can leave you desk, it is better to use a paper shredder with a larger feed slot and a larger basket. ---  --- This is also a personal shredder, if you need to shred from more than two minutes at a time (approximately 24 DVDs or CDs or Floppy Discs), you should get a commercial grade machine
i got to get it off my chest.  this camera takes great photos and they print out wonderful.  BUT, the camera has several down sides:   1. as all have said, it eats batteries big time.  this is a pain.  2. it recharges slow between flash and between non flash.  forget about catching a great spontaneous moment.   3. not durable.  i dropped mine out of the case from below waist hight and it does nto work at ALL.  i am sure by the time i send it in and pay for shipping and repair i can buy a new one that is cheaper and more reliable.  any suggestions???
Ch.9 - Heated Moments - graphic details of a girl starting her period. Writing makes it seem that a girl's period is something wrong
The picture is good and the combo was convenient.  However, after 1 year, the DVD broke.  Now I have just a TV.  This is the problem with combos.  It is better to get components separately
This item is more of a foot and ankle massager if you have long legs.  I am tall with a 37" inseam.  This item is not made for someone who has longer than "average" legs unless you're looking for a foot and ankle massage rather than a calf massage. 
It was really cute when I got it.  Two days later, the color started chipping away. The stones started falling off as well. I was so disappointed when it happened since it looked so nice when I got it. I do not recommend buying it.
That's the drawback of buying a new thing on the internet because you can not feel or smell it. I bought the whole set as I am a sandalwood fanatic. i couldn't have been more disappointed, this thing whatever it is does not smell like sandalwood. a complete waste of money
The book uses cartoons to emphasize the text. It's always interesting to see what common words different cultures use to describe the human condition.  Wastes a lot of space, though.  Worth the price
Okay, after reading several reviews, I decided to buy this anyway for a few laughs.  Boy did I get my moneys worth!  It was so incredibly BAD that I was first cringing in horror before I started laughing.  The characters, especially Hiei, were so screwed up and the voice dubbing was so unfamiliar that in the end it had me laughing.   ---  --- Now, I'm a die hard yyh fan, but I give it high marks just because it was so much fun to watch.  Put me in a good mood for the rest of the day.  If you arent pressed for cash and up for a few laughs i'd definitely suggest  buying for th he11 of it
Atomic watches are highly-accurate quartz watches which are synchronized each day with a time signal broadcast from the definitive U.S. Atomic Clock in Ft. Collins, Colorado. Thus, all atomic watches are always accurate to within a fraction of a second at any time. Since atomic watches adjust automaticaly to and from daylight saving time they are the ultimate in accurate watches. Casio makes -- and Amazon sells -- a wide selection of styles of atomic watches to suit various needs and tastes, but all are equally accurate. The Casio G-Shock series is especially rugged and the solar powered models, such as this, never require battery replacement. Atomic accurary, solar power, and G-Shock ruggedness is an appealing combination at a quite reasonable price
My 21 month old toddler loved the star crayon, and so did I initially.  However, during its first use the red crayon fell out of the plastic holder.  The problem is the shape of the crayon is like a round piece of candy.  My son picked it up and was about to put it in his mouth when I saw what had happened.  Personally, I would not use the product given the choking hazard that it presented.  Otherwise, I would use it with care and watch your child carefully as they play with the product. 
My wife and I love this product.  Now, it's not for backpacking, but it does work great as a car camping or base camp stove.  It does require one of those disposable propane tanks (which can be tough to dispose of), and it might make sense to get the carrying case (not seeing it attached here).  But besides that, a great, simple stove which can be used in all kinds of conditions
This is a terrific tour of Hawaii.  The photography is incredible and it shows Hawaii's breathtaking scenery including beautiful beaches on Oahu and Maui, Mt. Haleakala and Waimea Canyon.  The music's great and the narration includes lots of travel tips as you're completely immersed in a Hawaiian vacation - volcanoes, exciting nightlife, surfing, scuba dives and hulas that "were so alluring that the missionaries banned them".  The only person who would not like this DVD simply doesn't want to unwind and relax during this fascinating travel guide.  After you see this you'll want to explore this paradise yourself and this DVD will help you plan your trip or your honeymoon
this movie is so good i can't even find it anywhere. if you come across a copy of this buy it. it is reminissant of american history x, or slc punk in the fact that it is mostly about teen-aged boys comming of age. while the first two movies were aimed at a pirticualy sceen, this will hit home for the rest of us. drugs are bad!! :
My 1 1/2 year old son really enjoys this toy. he loves putting the little men on top.  He doesn't play with the toys on the side, guess thats for younger kids, but he does enjoy the shape sorter and the drawbridge opening is cute and holds his attention.  I find an advantage over the classic Fisher price is that he can't as easily just rip the cover off and toss the pieces in when he gets frustrated.  At this age, I find the Alphabet pieces a waste and wish there were more shapes to sort.  Perhaps when he's older he'll enjoy the letters as well, but I doubt he'll still be interested.  Overall, cute toy that holds his attention while many do not.  Main drawback is that there are only 4 shapes to sort
I bought this Dakota backless booster for my nearly 6 year old.  She previously was using a Jupiter Komfort Kruiser XL100, which I loved.  The Komfort Kruiser was a booster with a back, and although it still fits her to this day, she was eager to move into a backless booster.  I think the Dakota booster works great.  It gets her to the height she needs for the seatbelt, but allows her to feel more like a big kid by not having a back.  This booster is a quality item and large enough to fit her until she will be old and large enough to no longer require a booster.  The pocket on the side is handy as well, although does not work well with drinks (I advise buying a bottle holder to put on the arm rest!)
AFTER 2 NIGHTS OF NO SLEEP BECAUSE OUR 18 MONTHS OLD SON FIGURED OUT HOW TO FLIP HIMSELF OUT OF THE PACK N PLAY (WITH JUST SHEER UPPER BODY STRENGTH!)I WAS SO RELIEVED TO FIND THIS CRIB TENT AND IT WAS A PAIN TO PUT TOGETHER (IT TOOK ABOUT 20 MINUTES) BUT WELL WORTH IT BECAUSE IT WORKS...HE HAS STAYED IN THE PACK N PLAY AND DIDN'T SEEM TO CARE AT ALL THAT HE WAS "TRAPPED", I THINK KIDS DO LIKE THE PLAYFULNESS OF A TENT. MY 4 YEAR OLD WAS JEALOUS! THERE ARE A FEW DOWNSIDES...ITS A PAIN TO SET UP AND BREAK DOWN AND IF YOUR USING THE PACK N PLAY FOR OVER NIGHTS AND TRAVEL IT ISN'T AS PORTABLE AS COULD BE...AND I HAVE AN OLDER PACK N PLAY, ITS FROM '02 WHEN WE HAD OUR FIRST BABY SO THE ENDS ARE HIGHER THAN THE SIDES SO THE CLIPS HAVE NO WHERE TO CLIP ONTO BUT IT HASN'T MATTERED. THE SIDE CLIPS HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TO KEEP OUR STRONG TODDLER IN PLACE. OVERALL THE PRODUCT IS EXPENSIVE AND A PAIN TO SET UP BUT PRICELESS BECAUSE IT LETS THE WHOLE FAMILY SLEEP SOUNDLY AND SAFELY!
I've read all of the reviews . I too own this model . It does what it was designed to do . BURLWOOD is much more ....overpriced ? People sometimes need to be taken by the hand . Especially the overpriveleged . You don't know what it's like to be rich untill you've been poor . AND...you don't know how good your winder is till' you find the proper direction . AS in all things , others are not going to do it for you ALL of the time . BUT in this case I'll make an exception . Some watches wind in both directions...you know - GO BOTH WAYS ? AS do a lot of ....back to the winder lesson , and some only go ONE WAY . Find out what way you need to go and GO THERE !...PROBLEM SOLVED ( help me..this isn't working...oh , PLEASE ! ) The moral too this story is "in a plastic world try not to always have WOOD !! GOD gave you a brain . Read my revie
T-mobile has the worst customer services. Sometimes, It is the company's mistake and they still blame it on the customer. Since I started my plan, I had a problem reciving my bill on time. So, the company start charging me $5 late fee for four consecutive months. Also, when I tried adding additional features such as their text-message-bundle, the change on the account did not take effect till two days later, and I was charged for 10 cents for each message I used in these two days,and It costed me an additional $4. Every time I tried complaining to their customer services, they just wouldn't listen. I am starting to get the feeling that they are just trying to maximize their profit. More than once, if I stay long-enough on the line, they put me on mute so they don't have to listen to my complaining. I feeling that I am being treated like dirt not like a customer. I had the worst customer-services experience with t-mobile. Also, the reception is not the best in the country. I had friends who were using the same phone as the one I have but different network, and they were getting services in places where I don't have it, and they pay about the same amount of money
The old DVD from 1997 looks better than the new HD version. I've compared the two, and the first DVD had good color saturation, dark blacks and looked right with the heavy red and brown palette. The HD version has a blue-green haze covering everything and the picture is too bright. They also removed the film grain and made the image look smooth and creamy. The sound quality is better now, though, and the image of course is higher resolution.
The cursor is so minute it is difficult to see it. ---  --- Makes the game unplayable in most suitable environments. ---  --- Design issue could be fixed easily
Great Product!..My wife gave it to me as a birthday present and I thought what a cheap gift..But who would have ever thought this would actually save me a year of tickets
This stuff is so boring. I can't believe people still listen to this stuff. Seriously come on people! I laugh every time I see some guy trying to play this stuff anywhere. Plus Busta has admitted to having "relationships" with men if you get what I mean. Makes you wonder about a lot of rappers....
BOUGHT THIS ITEM FOR MT SON, AND HE JUST LOVES IT. --- HE PLAYS WITH IT ALL THE TIME, FROM THE TIME HE GETS HOME --- FROM SCHOOL UNTIL DINNER TIME, AND FROM AFTER DINNER UNTIL BED TIME
I have to admit I was a little hesitant in sending this to my mom for Mother's Day.  There were so many mixed reviews from most of the Wine Country Gift Baskets.  My mom got it a few dasy before Mother's Day (which is better than after I guess.  She absolutly loved it.  Everyone said how lucky she was to have such a thoguhtful daughter.  So Yay!! I am thrilled and I will order from WCGB again
I originally planned to purchase Locin floss to replace the DenTek, but I'm not too pleased with it so far. ---  --- PLUSES --- ======= --- -Each individually wrapped floss. --- -Doesn't contain floride. ---  --- MINUSES --- ======= --- -Flimpsy handle--almost not usable. --- -Wrap is not 100% sealed. --- -flossing head is shallower and narrower than the DenTek
This product work perfectly in the Epson printer! The quality of printing is great!
These Colombian D'Ordado pods work well in my Krups Home Cafe machine. The overall flavor is good. I do like my coffee a little stronger, so I use 2 of these pods and the two-6 ounce cup setting for a nice, big mug of morning coffee
I was disappointed in this book.  The art and techniques illustrated are of the type one might expect to see on a TV Craft Show.   I would instead recomment Robert Wade's watercolor book.    
I've rarely had bad experiences with Microsoft mice or keyboards. Usually they tend to have above average design and put thought into the product. ---  --- They evidently didn't hire the "good" designer to work on this product however as this mouse has 2 glaring faults. ---  --- #1: The shallow height and shape of the mouse is such that it offers no support for your hand whatsoever. This causes hand strain and inconsistent hand placement as you use it. You never get the feeling that your hand is in "the right position". ---  --- #2: The side buttons are in brain dead locations. Why this is I have no idea, as other Microsoft models put the left side button right where your thumb would be if you move your thumb up slightly (the way it should be). On this "gaming" mouse the left thumb button is much too far forward causing you to have to practically re-adjust your grip on the mouse just to press it. Couple this with problem #1 and the lack of surface contact with your hand causes the mouse to skew under your hand as you press the button thus turning your player to one side when you didn't intend to. Just what you don't want when throwing a grenade. ---  --- The right button is sort of click-able with your pinky and is actually the more accessible button, but it feels more due to luck than planning. ---  --- I have to wonder if they even tested this design with any gamers at all before putting it out on the street. ---  --- I give it 2 stars because for the attempt at wireless feel with the thin cord, and it looks visually appealing. Calling this a "gaming" mouse however and charging a premium for it is a joke you should spare yourself being the butt of. ---  --- Rating: Not Recommended
Learn to Play Chess with Fritz and Chesster 2, continues where the first CD left off.  Like the first CD, this program may take some guessing regarding what exactly is one supposed to do, and clicking on the crown in the upper right corner helps to navigate through the game.   ---  --- This program is really good for grasping the basic tactics and strategies because your progress is measured and you have to develop certain skill proficiency before moving to higher level and learning more tactics and strategies. ---  --- The CD covers some popular opening moves, middle game tactics like pins, forks, skewers and deflection, and mating strategies in end game.  With practice on this CD, you can begin to win some games, and then move on to Learn to Play Chess with Fritz and Chesster 3, which is out in German, and is supposed to be out soon in English
I was going to buy this camera for my teenage daughter today, but after reading the reviews I decided that it is not a god risk if the customer service is that bad and the screen seems to break without any kind of impact.   --- I'm sure it takes nice pictures, but a lot of cameras take nice pictures.  I have to go where the service will at least respect you. 
The shape of this pendant is very flattering (elongated, draws the eye downward).  It looks great with the "Windows" hoops I purchased at the same time.  The chain is nice, and as with all Zina sterling - the silver is very polished and beautiful
We are delighted with our new chairs and table.  The products were well-packed and came in excellent condition.  The chairs are sturdy, ample and comfortable even without the cushions.  The cushions that come with are very nice, but too thick for my liking.  The chairs have an additional feature of leveling pads on the bottom of each leg that can be screwed in or out to accommodate uneven surfaces.  The table is big enough for a full dinner for four, but small enough to still feel intimate. We now spend a lot more time on our patio
Its effect very much depends on the climate you live in. If you live in a colder and dry climate, especially during winter it does exactly as it promises - great moisturizer, lines are diminished, as is puffiness. I really love using it - I am 35 and currently living in a cold and dry climate. But in hot and sometims humid climates, or during summer it just doesn't work as well - I don't know why. I like it a lot and this is my 3rd bottle, although I am using it as a seasonal eye care
In my previous review, very happy to receive my KC shoes but to my surprise these were a "disappointment"!  Very cheap looking, there were some visible defects (noticed right away), too small and the bottom of the shoe looked worn. Tribeca's are my favorite KC shoes but again, if you wear a 9, go a size up for a better fit and comfortability.   ---  --- Good luck, shoe shoppers
Our local Macy's recently offered free skin typing and the samples to go with it. I really only went to pick up a free moisturizer as I've found with some judicious sampling you don't have to pay for that item. Instead, I fell in love with this soap (and got free moisturizer too-hooray!!) ---  --- When the sales rep first handed me the bar soap, I balked. I've known people who've used Clinique but just the idea of washing my face with BAR soap freaked me out. They do offer a liquid version but the rep told me the soap was a better exfoliant. I can't say for sure if that's so but I can say this really is a great face wash. I was addicted after one use. And since it is a bar of soap, you'll get a really great sudsy foam. It has a mild, pleasant scent and it washes off easily. I have the mild version and I just love it. My skin feels clean but never tight and not only does it not cause breakouts, it immediately calmed the one I had. I'll definitely be buying more.  ---  --- I do want to add, however, it is drying in the wintertime if you have normal skin and I had to switch to a cream cleanser. It may not be a problem for oily skin. For dry skin, I'd really avoid it in the winter at least. ---  --- You still ideally need a makeup remover before the soap. I also became a recent convert to Clinique's Rinse Off Foaming Cleanser. But even if you don't want to use that product, remember that removing your makeup is a separate step.
My boyfriend just found out the hard way that he has a wheat gluten allergy. I've tried experimenting with different non wheat fours, but they're expensive and don't turn out very well.  (And I'm a good cook!) He especially misses shortbread and butter cookies, so we were thrilled to see these in a local market!  They're a little different, but they're good! This is coming from someone who hates store bought cookies.  I'd pick these over most wheat flour cookies any day
I received them OK none broken or cracked. This price beats Walmarts price and these cases are as good as any slim cases I have ever used. I like the translucent back better than the black ones at Staples
I bought the SR-60 after a lenghty review on the internet. My goal was to find the best available headphones for a low budget (around $80). I have been very satisfied with the SR-60. The sound is great, confort is incredible. Since sound is not contained they may be somewhat annoying for surrounding non-listeners. So if you are looking for first quality sound, low budget headphones and don't care to much about the looks, these are the ones to go with. 
I just received the 2007 version, and could not be happier. Like other Moleskine products, this weekly planner is of excellent quality. --- The layout is very simple, and the size is perfect for a purse. Each day in the week is allocated about 7 lines, with three days on one page, and four on the other (Sat and Sun share their space) --- I have owned notebooks of the same size (with similar leather cover), which I used daily, and have never experienced any problems with binding.  --- Overall, this is an excellent planner!
Fast delievery, great price and quality, we will enjoy it many years to come
I wasn't aware the only swords that existed and were noteworthy enough to grace the pages of an Encyclopedia were European. Seems to me much is left out by ignoring the Eastern blades
I've used Adobe products for years and years and will continue to do so
These are just delicious--and I like having the controlled portions in the bags--a very satisfying snack for 150 calories
I grew up with the original DS.  I also saw the two "spin off" movies: "House of Dark Shadows" and "Night of Dark Shadows."  Needless to say I was extremely excited about the "revival," and I wasn't disappointed.  I felt that Dan Curtis was actually able to improve upon the original, by tightening up the script and employing wonderful actors who fit like the proverbial glove.  The original Barnabus was played by Jonathan Frid who was a Shakespearian trained actor and, Ben Cross is a member of the Royal Shakespearian Theatre in London.  I loved that the revival was able to be more overtly sexual, which as any fan of vampires must know is an essential element of the myth.  And I must say this series lived up to my every expectation.  Dan Curtis took the original and made it completely accessible to older viewers who have such fond memories of the 1963 soap opera.  I looked forward to 3:30 every day after school.  It's too bad that the Gulf War killed it.  Yes it did!  I was there.  After the Sunday, Monday miniseries, that Friday was to air the first "episode."  However it was pre-empted by coverage of the War.  Too, too bad.  I taped it, but unfortunately the last few episodes were accidentally taped over.  I am so glad to know that I can order it now in it's magical entirety.  I'm ordering it right now!  Thank you Amazon!!!!!!! ---  --- If you are a fan of things that go bump in the night, you will LOVE this series!!!!
Very good movie.  Great acting & plot.  Very touching.  I am very glad I own this movie.  I will watch it very often
I thought this product was easy to use and produced decent results.  It works better than some of the more expensive software; I have tried at least a half-dozen similar programs, but I keep returning to this bargain-bin favorite.  For the money, it is an excellent value. 
Perhaps a pediatrist who knows better designed this shoe's insert, but I hated it. It felt half-there. There was good cushion at the back and felt like none at the front - like those "orthotic" deals that come on infomercials. Well, it didn't feel good on my tender forefoot so I sent them back. ---  --- On the other hand, the shoe looked great. I guess, if you really want it, shoe can go shopping for some Dr. Scholl's
Takes FOREVER to shave - and still doesn't get everything - still have to end up shaving with a razor.  Frustrating - but good concept
I am a new subscriber, have received two issues so far. This is a fascinating magazine, beautifully laid out, and well written. In the first issue I received (which I have now read almost cover-to-cover, something I Never do with magazines), there were articles about Dog rescue in Asia, the science of the historical relationship between Dogs and their humans, emotional vignettes about the love between Dogs and humans and so much more. --- I like the reviewer who likened this magazine to the New Yorker about Dogs. The first issue was chock-full of everything from useful tips to weepy stories to fascinating science. --- I made an effort to cancel all of my magazine subscriptions recently, simply because I do not have the time to read them all. This one will remain. In fact, I may start archiving this magazine-it is that good! All of our guests inevitable pick up the magazine, drawn by the crisp graphics, and retained by a healthy variety of reading. --- Obviously, I am a fan. I have barely started the second issue, but from skimming the articles, I have full faith that I will not be disappointed. --- Subscribe and enjoy
I do video work and was attracted to the sale price and extra height of this particular tripod.  Come to find out, this model does not have a fluid head, meaning, if you do any panning with a camcorder, it won't be as smooth as you'd probably like it to be.  Also, at the end of a pan the head tends to "unwind," causing your panned image to back up a little ways.  Thus, I think it's rather misleading to label this as a "Photo / Video" tripod.   ---  --- Additionally, I don't really care for the cheap feel of some of the plastic knobs and adjusters.  Finally, mine came with a few, very minor cosmetic blemishes, almost as if it were used. ---  --- Instead of video, I'll be utilizing this one as a microphone mount. ---  --- If you want to do video, please buy a tripod with a fluid head.  You'll love it, I guarantee that. ---  --- That's why I give this one 2 stars
If you do not yet own Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here AND The Wall, do not even consider purchasing A Momentary Lapse of Reason. AMLOR is junk by comparison. ---  --- That said, very few rock albums ever made can hang with those three, and AMLOR certainly has its bright spots. "Learning to Fly" and "On the Turning Away" are as good as anything Pink Floyd has ever produced. Some of the other songs are adequate, but this album does not contain the front-to-back brillance of the earlier Floyd releases. It's definitely worth having, but make sure that you have the others first. --- 
After I read the reviews on this toy, I wanted to cancel my order. Thankfully I didn't because my kids love it. I have two boys 5 & 9 and they love bowling with this toy. My kids have played with it since we got it in Feburary. In the reviews, people said the toy broke soon after playing with it. My kids play with it all the time and we have not had any problems. Everything still works great; the pins, the sound, and the ball return.
My son received this when he was 15 months old and has never stopped playing with it regularly.  He loves putting things in the back and zooming around the living room.  Great buy
After buying this camera I was pleased for the most part, as the interface is extremely simple and the picture quality is very good. It's a sleek, smooth design with minimal buttons, thus little confusion. There are 3 things, however, that I'm not happy with. One is that it takes double A batteries, and eats them up REALLY fast. The second thing is that there's no secondary viewfinder, just the LCD screen. The LCD screen is large, which is great.. but this is why the battery life is so low. You can't turn the LCD screen off, so batteries go fast. The third and final thing I dislike about it is that there's no AC adaptor, so whenever you plug your camera into the computer or the TV, not using it to take pictures, you have to run it on batteries. That is, unless you somehow find a compatible 3 volt AC plug, which is neither on the Vivitar website, or anywhere else online that I can find made specifically for this camera. I'm a little upset that it came with no adapter, as that would be SO useful for a camera that eats up batteries. I reccomend rechargibles if you're going to get this camera
I especially like this product for traveling and sitting in waiting rooms. My only complaint is that you have to hold it just right to see the puzzle clearly on the screen.  It has a contrast adjustment, but it not very helpful.  It also has a lighted screen option which is not very good either. A great improvement would be a screen with greater contrast. 
I had the La Crosse WS-2310 "Professional" Weather Station for 2 years, and it was NEVER fully functional.  I had to return the unit 3 times, as well as do a store replacement once, and I used the system for a year without the wind speed unit working - I simply didn't want the cost of returning the system yet again.  The software is absolutely horrible, and during the 2 years I had the system, there was never any software upgrades at all.  Given how deficient the software was, this was quite surprising.  For example, there is no calculation of daily rain amounts or monthly rain amounts.  The system is too stupid to differentiate between days.  The date recorded to the simple spreadsheet database is always one day off (yesterday's date is recorded today).  Overall, the software looks to be a high schooler's science project done the night before it was due. If you're going to purchase a La Crosse system, plan on spending money on 3rd party software, as well as allowing about 30% of your purchase price in product return costs. La Crosse tech support is non-existant: call & get a recorded message to leave your number & they will return the call - but they NEVER do... and I do mean NEVER!  Send an email and the same response - NONE!  It's a very frustrating joke.  After 2 years, I gave up and purchased a truly professional system from a competitor.  My only regret was having waited 2 years to throw in the towel with La Crosse.  I give La Crosse 1 star only because there is no 0 star rating
I have a hard time believing that the author has ever seen an episode of TNG. I had to force myself to finish this book it was so bad. By far the worst Star Trek book I have ever read.  If you want a good one read 'Federation' and stay as far away from this one as you can
this boat seemed like a great idea, and my 7 month baby does like it. it gets him in the water, which is fun, but i cant even take my eyes off him for one nano-second. he has fallen over the sides, he has fallen forward between the seat and tube. the seat is so small and there is so much space between it and the tube. my babys legs fit fine in the leg opening. this boat is dangerous. i am looking for a new one
I was impressed by the look of this bag.  It really looked like it would seal the contents well.  Unfortunately, it did not.  I tried several times, and each time, the contents of the bag were soaked! --- Fortunately I tested it out with just some cash for a day at the pool... and only ended up with soggy money.  If I had put my cell phone and watch in the bag, they would have been ruined. --- I DON'T RECOMMEND IT
I just don't know where to start.  There just doesn't seem to be a way to describe the comfort.  You will just have to try them on to believe it.  My neighbor, mother, husband and I all swear by this product.  Accept no substitutions.   Attractive...no, but the comfort will blow you away
The best out of three guide books I looked at, and a must for the first trip to the big island. 
After being into the "techno" scene since my first party in 1993, this is one of the best videos I have seen describing the DJ feelings. You really get a feel for how a DJ thinks. If you at all interested in the DJ lifestyle or are interested in DJing this is a must have. It have great insights in the minds of some of the best DJs around. Plus Nigel Richards does a great job with the "How to DJ" part. Not only is this for the "newbies" but for those who have been around a bit. Plus he makes learning fun with his comments and body mannerisms. WOW that sounded like an infomercial
I love this product, and the rest of the Pack-It system, beyond all reason.  I've given them as gifts repeatedly. ---  --- In effect, they give you "drawers" in your suitcase, and sub-drawers within the drawers of hotel dressers.  It's easy to take out a pair of slacks without disarranging everything else.  ---  --- The 18" folder works well for womens' shirts, blouses, and slacks.  I can easily fit say three pairs of slacks and two shirts into it.  If you want to carry more or fewer pieces, it's forgiving.  I use it for suit jackets too, folding them in across the width of the folder. ---  --- I've used mine often over perhaps 8 years, and they still look like new. ---  --- A standard-sized 21" roll-aboard suitcase will neatly hold: 1 18-inch folder (this product), two full-sized Pack-It cubes, a small pack-it sac holding travel adapters and rechargers, a toiletries bag (not from this sytem) and a pair of shoes (squeezed).  It also works to omit the cubes and use two 18" folders, depending on the clothes being packed.
I recently became a fan of Body Shop products and am only sorry that I didn't try them sooner.  Their products are all, without fail, of superior quality.  The Satsuma line especially is wonderful, and is my favorite scent from the Body Shop.  It is the juicy fresh smell of tangerines/oranges.  I have read some reviews that it reminds people of a creamsicle type scent but I completely disagree with that. I have never liked creamsicle scents and I love Satsuma.  It is not cloying or too sweet.  It is a very pure scent and I always feel clean and beautiful while wearing it.  One other thing to note about this product...  I do not always like perfume oils because the scent is not always accurate when compared to other products in the same line.  I am not sure if this is because sometimes the oils are so concentrated that they smell like "too much".  The Satsuma oil is not like that at all - it smells true to the rest of the line.  The scent also lasts for a long time after being applied, due to the fact that it is a perfume oil.  A little goes a long way - I would not be surprised if the bottle lasted for over a year.  I love this product and give it my highest recommendation.  
What a beautiful bicycle!! I thought it was black and white from the photo but it's a really lovely forest green and white. It was really easy to put together myself.  My husband is really excited about it. He's pretty tall and this bike is more comfortable size for him than his last cruiser.  Very happy with this purchase! Great price too!  My own Schwinn cruiser came from a local shop and was twice as much. 
Great towel for the gym or after swimming.  Very absorbant and I also use one to cover the circuit machines when I use them
I purchased this watch for my father as a gift.  The blue face is beautiful, the numbers are easy to read, it's light weight and keeps perfect time.  He loves this watch and has had many compliments since he started wearing it
light, intricate, and very cute! They came very quickly, and the price was very fair! I have a second piercing in my left ear and I like to wear one there so along with my other jewelry I always have a fairy whispering in my ear :
Okay, it's not one of the fancy, traditional mags but I found loads of things that generated ideas. The sections showing design elements carried through the house were my favorites.  It may be on the advertising end of the spectrum in some regards, but I liked seeing similar (but different) approaches to the same design goal by various manufacturers.  Having all the web addresses made it easy for me to follow-up on designs I liked, and I didn't have to worry that the editors were trying to curry favor with their advertisers by pontificating on the merits of one item over another. ---  --- I'm a visual learner and this fit the bill. Unlike another reviewer who would suggest that this is due to my gender, I think that people respond differently to the same presentation of material.  Don't write this off because it's not a marquee magazine--try it first.  You might just like it.  And by the way, I do read and like magazines and books that have no pictures, too
these earings are the worst! they are way too heavy and the rocks on the bottom weent the same color! on was grey and one was black! I dont recommend this
This is a great little barbecue.  From carne asadaa to teryaki flank ribs, this little guy does a great job.
 My 2 year old grandson loves balls of any kind,when I found this activity set I knew he would really enjoy it,he plays with it for hours. The only downside of this is that he cannot keep up with the balls. It would be great if this company would give parents,or grandparents an order form to get replacement balls to give this fun toy longer life
Very well satisfied . It's great for a kid to learn to tell time,and the design with velcro strap makes it very adjustable
I found this product good, i have no problems with it what so ever. some people say just buy a dvd player but then you have more wires in the back of your tv. Also if you want your x box and dvd player to go into one suround sound or stereo the is great cause you get to have a dvd player and a x box in one wire going into the speakers. this is also great if you dont want to spend any more money on buying another dvd player and you already have a xbox. i have my xbox upstairs with the dvd adapter, and a dvd player down stairs so if i want a change of secnery. ---  --- i love my xbox and it's adapter i have no problem with the remote either
If your a Pacino fan this is for you one of his earlier films --- This deals with a lawyer not a crooked lawyer but a good mostly honest lawyer and all the things that a lawyer has goon through or could go through this is a instant classic and the story to the movie is excellent  ---  --- Highly recomende
This is great-my daughter looks for reasons to use and wear the quick gems
I purchased the non-premium kit ($9.99) with a Silicone skin case cover and 2 screen protectors (one for each screen), but it is the same case.  The problem is that the silicone skin cover is slippery, twice as slippery as the Nintendo Lite without the cover. We thought that washing them in Dove dish soap would wash away the slipperyness, but that didn't work. After handling the cover, your hands have a slippery residue on them.  The other issue is that the cover is so thin that it is little more than scratch protection, not impact protection.  The screen covers that come with the non-premium kit are ok, I guess, but one of them had 2 defect particles that were raised (trust me, the screen was clean).   ---  --- I purchased 2 kits, and I had one screen protector defect and my wife accidentally broke one of the silicone covers hinge straps with little effort.  I do not recommend this product at all
i ordered this last fall for a 40th party it looks nice but after a windy day a piece of the top broke off and after that it all fell apart because it didnt have any support from the broke top rail
Product was supposedly shipped 1-4-07 and still do not have i
I DIDN'T RECEIVE THE MAT YET. BUT I ALREADY ORDERED IT, I AM  DISAPPOINTED TO SEE, OTHERS GOT THE SAME ITEM FOR 12.OO DOLLARS. AND 9.99. BUT I AM PAYING DOUBLE THE PRICE
If you want to do the same exercise over and over.. but with better make up and cuter outfit go ahead. ---  --- If you want better exercises and articles look to Oxygen or Women's M&
I added these batteries to an order of a few other things, and didn't realize that they were going to ship this separately from Circuit city. Make sure if you pick this, that you are getting something else from CC, or else you will end up like me. With a huge box (you could fit 4 Tom Clancey novels in the box) shipped to you with a pack of batteries and end up paying more for shipping then you spend on the batteries
Maybe beginning ones were a bad batch? Had mine months now and it works great. Everything it says, it does. No problems  keeping it in the system and did not cause any errors.
This was the most user unfriendly Turbotax I have ever used.  The Schedule C imported misinformation, had to keep forcing in the correct info. And I just found out my State taxes were received showing I owed a completely different amount than what I had electronically filed.  I have used this program for years, but after this, NEVER AGAIN!!! Let this be a warning to others
This dryer works great but it gets pretty hot.  Watch your ears and fingertips
I like this case very much for my Blackberry.  It definitely improves the grip on the Blackberry especially when I'm using it as a phone.  It also serves as an excellent protector when I throw it in my purse.  My two problems are that I wish there was more variety in the colors available similar to the Speck Ipod protective cases.  (Come on guys!  Women use these items too!)  Also, the rubber strip between the screen and the keyboard has become loose and not fitted to the Blackberry in the week that I've had this case.  Other than those two things, this is a great, not bulky case. 
Worked well five times. Then it slowed down and made cutting more difficult despite removing head and running water through it to clean, as per instructions. Then it would run before cutting, but upon trying to edge trim my moustache, it would stop immediately, as if a single hair could jam it. Removing head, as required for cleaning, showed that bottom part with its drive motor worked fine, with a rotating metal stub that fit loosely into a poorly made plastic part that moved the blade. It appears that this plastic part's stability, shape and alignment changed after a few uses allowing hairs to jam its movement. A poor design that shouldn't have used plastic. Do not bu
I've read many books on meditation and while each of them answers some of my questions, Jack Kornfield's book, A Path with Heart, answers every one save those that must be experienced first-hand in one's own time.  His  voice and advice is articulate, intelligent, humorous, open, patient and  wise.  He starts out by telling you a little about his own experience, goes  on to cover the basics of vipassana meditation and then leads you bit by  bit deep into the issues every meditator and spiritual seeker must face.   What I love most about his teaching style is that he gives gentle,  practical advice on the day-to-day, minute by minute stuff to do to  explore, commit to, love being on the path.  If my house were on fire and I  had to grab only one book on my way out the door, it would be A Path with  Heart
AFI finally release a live DVD, and as a portrayal of the band as it stands now, it is very impressive. It does lack older, more hardcore punk tracks, but that is to be expected as the band grows and matures into the  band it is now. Each album progresses towards more epic scales, and songs balance beauty with power. "I Heard a Voice" captures this on film, and the fan gets to witness AFI at their most grandiose. Watching vocalist Davey Havok sing "God Called in Sick Today" while being held up by the audience is amazing to watch and gives this reviewer chills everytime. The masterful command of theatrics from each member, especially Havok, creates a powerful feeling unable to fully describe but easy to appreciate. The setlist itself is perfectly put together, with the only gripe being the exclusion of "Kiss and Control." The rest of the songs display all facets of AFI, from the fast paced "Dancing Through Sunday",(which includes a nicely executed guitar solo by guitarist Jade Puget) "Kill Caustic", "Death of Seasons", "Totalimmortal" and "A Single Second", (the last of which features a guest appearance by Nick 13 of Tiger Army) to the slower paced "This Time Imperfect" and "Endlessly, She Said" as well as all of their recent singles, and a few more cuts from their latest releases "Decemberunderground" and "Sing the Sorrow". Extras are geared towards the fans, with Despair Faction interviews and the inclusion of videos from their massive scavenger hunt prior to the Decemberunderground release, as well as a poster.  ---  --- Each band member has their moments to shine, and are all very capable and talented muscians. Bassist Hunter Burgan and drummer Adam Carson lay down a solid foundation as well as background vocals, as Puget layers his unique guitar sound and obvious mastery, in this genre, over the instrument. This is all built up to allow Havok to use his unique vocal approach to wander in between melodies and notes, mixing powerful singing with a fantastic screaming voice, to create beautiful atmospheres of sound that can crash down on you just as easily as it hypnotizes you. ---  --- The quality of the sound production as well as the video edits are fantastic. Unlike other live DVD's, where the concert is edited to the point of a music video, "I Heard a Voice" has just the right amount to not make you forget you are watching a live dvd, but also add to the overall effect of the performance. The sound is very clear, and the sound levels are perfectly set to allow each member to cut through the mix.  ---  --- This is overall a very stellar production, and fans who have already embraced the new direction of the band, as well as new fans and casual fans, should find the dvd to be quite entertaining and a very worthwhile buy
product functions well, and looks good. --- If I could change one thing, the swivel action is just a little looser than I would like, but definatly not a problem
This was my favorite episode as a kid.  I was so happy to see I could download it to watch with my kids
I got this system for my 18 mo. old who was playing a game by sticking his leg through the slats of his crib and then claiming he was "stuck".  They have helped prevent him from doing that any more.  However, if he's in the mood, he can easily dismantle the entire contraption - so it won't work to keep an older child from tearing it apart if they want to.  In fact, the two end panels had to be removed because he wouldn't leave them alone.  All in all though, I think the mesh "bumpers" do what they claim and they work well at keeping toys (and pluggers) in the crib instead of out on the floor
Great magazine.  This is not my typical type of read, because I've never considered myself as someone into computers or multi-media.  But the great thing about this magazine is that you don't have to be someone that already knows a lot about technology to learn about the latest gizmos.  It tells you about them in simple terms too, no high-tech vocabulary needed.  I feel informed whenever I read my monthly subscription, of the better products to purchase, as well as the politics behind the big computer and internet companies
I really could not tell you anything, as I still have not recieved this game, despite having paid for it over a month and a half ago
I use my belt holster with all the phones i've owned, my i530 is no --- exception. This belt holster feels really well made, it has a strong belt clip which is good for how hard I use it. A big plus is that I can use my phone while it's in the holster
I bought this gadget with the intent of monitoring my daily steps to get an idea of where I was currently to establish some sort of baseline so that I could get a reality check on my activity levels.  I opened the box, read the easy directions, set up my personal step measurement (just measure off the distance of your 10 steps), and clipped it on my pants and forgot about it for the day.  I was surprised to find out that a corpse could probably move around more during the day than me! Over the next 6 days, (this pedometer keeps track of 7 days of steps for you); I literally stepped up my game and went from 756 steps with NO aerobic exercise on day 1, to 7,880 steps with 30 minutes of nonstop aerobic exercise on day 3! Every day has been getting easier to achieve the 10,000 "normal" steps, and increasing the aerobic steps too (which are tracked separately). I can press the mode button, check out how many miles my steps translate to, kilocalories burned, aerobic steps, and compare it with the past 7 days as well. It has turned out to be even more fun than what I originally bought it for. I actually feel better, and the fun part is that I am trying to beat my own personal record from the previous day! This has been an eye-opening experience for me, and I keep this on or in my pocket all the time now, just to make sure I keep a mindful eye on my steps and aerobic activity for the day
que maravilla comprar por amazon.com todo llego en perfecto estad
All the reviews so far sound like personal friends of B.W. who are puffing the book. The book is simple and would require more information. So why not just go buy a book with more information.
The title really says it all! I make a point to keep a soup can packed with these next to the pencil cup on my desk. I haven't gotten the two confused yet
The Satinelle Ice Epilator does exactly what it is supposed to do: remove hair quickly and efficiently by the root. What an advantage! Hair does not reappear as quickly as it does shaving, and when it does, it is not the sharp stubble that happens with shaving. ---  --- I don't think it hurts much, though some spots may be a bit more sensitive than others. The trick then is to simply lift it up off of the skin and stop momentarily.  ---  --- I am very happy with this product
I bought this for my 3yr old twins, and from the first showing, I kept hearing giggling and laughing as they watched the cartoons. My girls already are familiar with some fairy tales, so they really loved "The Three Little Pigs" and "The Pied Piper". I highly recommend this DVD and think it is a great buy for parents with young children
I don't know who these people are, but they will give praise for ANYTHING!  Ms. London is a wonderful singer, but the producers must have given her sleeping pills.  This is a boring CD!  Like Peggi Blu, who won Star Search, her record company "toned her down" for her debut album, with banal and boring songs with that stupid hip/hop "dum de dum" Mary J. Blige beat, which will send you to nowheresville.   ---  --- Aretha Franklin's boring SO DAMN HAPPY was so awful, it's no longer available.  She went "Mary J." and almost lost the crown off her head.  Because she's Aretha Franklin (Queen of Soul) she DID manage (somehow) to get a non-deserved Grammy for "Wonderful" from that CD.  The Grammys also presented The Queen with her 17th competitive Grammy for her "A House Is Not A Home" mess.  What MUST they be thinking? ---  --- Well, LaToya London won't be considered for ANYTHING for this hip/hop mess.  She should get serious about some R & B (I mean the REAL r & b) and leave this light-weight fluff alone.  LaToya, you have a great voice -- use it.  Contact Sam Dees, Jo Armstead or Ashford & Simpson and BEG for some material! And, as Madame Rose would say, "Sing Out, Louise!!!
I love this book! It is a terrific blend of hand-holding and concrete advice for writers. Each chapter takes the writer/reader through the tough questions we face when we sit down to write: How do we begin? Where do ideas come from? Is there a ritual we can create that will help us begin? I like the fact that I could use this book as a resource. In other words, I did not have to read it cover to cover. Rather, it truly serves as a guide, a mentor's guide, that can serve me as I continue to write. I really liked the movie section,  where Cathleen Rountree uses movies to make points about the writing process.  I found those sections inspirational and useful. If you want to be a writer or if you are already writing, I urge you to Buy this book
I admittedly have not completed the full book, as it is thick.  However I do find that the narrative focuses on the reactive rather than the proactive tools needed for DFSS.  For example almost all the examples given in section 2 talk about an existing system or process and there doesn't seem to be any design examples and how the stats are used to solve the design problems.  I therefore think the book is more about Six Sigma than DFSS. ---  --- Barry
I grew up with this, and introduced my husband to it a few years ago.  He likes HP MUCH better than A1.  I use it on steak, hamburgers, meatloaf and roast beef sandwiches! ---  --- Try it out
These are by far the best tasting Spirulina bars in the market. The  whole line is more desert like in concept, so of course they are sweet & chewy. People with IBS probably should not eat finely chopped raw nuts and should read ingredients before buying!! ---  --- The food is safe for celiac, and most food allergens (AGAIN READ THE LABEL BASED ON YOUR DIETARY SITUATION!) ---  --- The bars travel very well and although they may bend and mush, because they are naturally moist and chewey, melting? Never. All the bars in this line travel great and can sit for months in hot or cold. ---  --- These are particularly good for athletes and people on the run. ---  --- Oh, and the price, come on, there is nothing else that even comes close for the size and quality
I only got the first issue, but it seems to be focused more on poets than other writers (hence the name).  i dont enjoy poetry but i love writing fiction.  They might do well to keep the two separate, especially the contests and events.  It's an attractive format and very upscale, high quality literature reviews and advice.  The stories are well written and enjoyable, although i think writers digest offers more for fiction writers
Very politically manipulative primer that only gives 5/8 of the story. I add 1/8 because the author does acknowlege some of the huge problems caused by unbridled global capitalism, but then quickly glosses them over basically saying that these effects are unfortunate, but that free global trade is best for everyone in the long run. There is a lot of interesting incidental information as various terms are explained, but too often this reference becomes a one-sided sermon for free trade. These are the same deceptions that Robert Reich started pushing under Clinton. Repubs kept the song going without missing a beat. Most of both Dem and Repub reps support neoliberal policies - the rich get richer in both parties. Feel free to read to learn about terms, just be aware that the author is leading you down a highly biased path
This is a vary good game one of the best on the PS2 these are my top ten favorite fighters  --- 1) Asuka Kazama --- 2) Christie Monteior --- 3) Ling Xiaoyu --- 4) Kazuya Mishima --- 5) Jin Kazama --- 6) King --- 7) Eddy Gordo --- 8) Nina Williams --- 9) Anna Williams --- 10) Devil Jin --- The only bad thing is Jinpachi Mishima cant be unlocked which sucks the DevilWithin mini game is ok Arcade is ranked overall the games is awsome and addicting you'll be playing for hours on end later.   
My daughter loves the sticker maker but she used the cartridge in one day and still has plenty of stickers left to make and I can not find the refills anywhere.  They need to make the refills for these types of toys easier to get.  I am to hesitant to buy the bead maker now because of that and I know my daughter would like it but It's a waste if it's a one time use and upsets my daughter
I bought two of these as a gift for my husband.  He'd previously bought himself one of those eletronic tie racks and the thing fell apart while he was trying to get it installed.  These were ready to go right out of the box, no assembly required, took up less space in his closet than the 3-4 hangers with ties wrapped around them that he had, and have made his tie collection managable and easy to select from.  The cushioned tie "hooks" ensure the ties will not slip off, and also that they will not be damaged.  A breeze to organize his vast tie collection.  And he's loving this product
This product is not worth the money.  It does not keep the car cool and was a waste of my money.  Beware of products that only make money for the inventor
I saw the other review that said it didn't work for V173, but I bought this anyway for my V170.  It also doesn't work for V170.  Why Amazon is advertising and selling this product as a Motorola V170 charger is beyond me.  I guess sometimes the products are mislabeled. 
Multi-element add-on lense used with Kodak DX-7590 provides good wide-angle capability.  Note that this is a very large add-on lense (screws into DX-7590 extension-piece which costs an additional $20).  Does the job well in most portraiture and scenic applications, however two caveats: --- (1) Slight curvature of field in extreme corners of wide-angle shots (ie, corners of shots may be noticeably out of focus).   Suggest cropping to 95% of original picture to maintain sharpness across plane. --- (2) Size of lense will render pop-up flash and outside the lense focusing system (Ultra-sonic) less functional. 
Before I get K10D, I experienced with Olympus E-500, CANON XTI, Nikon D80. --- I used Olympus E-500 to take lots vivid color pictures that I love very much, but no water resistance and no second Display window, also only 3 focus point makes it not so enjoyable. Same thing happen to Canon XTi, no water resistance and no second Display window make it little hard to use when you need to change settings. The Nikon D80 is a great camera but also have no water resistance and shake reducer build in on camera, the color tone of D80 isn't the kind that I would love. Finally I bought Pentax K10D, the feeling of the body,the water resistance, shake reducer,auto dust remove,vivid color tone,etc...makes me feel the K10D is the way to go. Only complaint would be the Limited Edition Lens are hard to get. Get it while you can
When putting together the mobile section of this item, I was very disappointed in its flimsiness. It looks like just a few knocks will cause the screws to break from the plastic.  --- When I turned it on I was disappointed a second time, this time by the irritating buzzing sound that the mobile makes as it rotates. It's so loud you can't hear the music, which is a shame because I'm sure my son would enjoy looking at the moving lights. --- The third disappointment - the buttons are VERY hit-and-miss. Sometimes the music buttons don't work (the lullaby one worked eventually once I mashed it in really hard). That I could live with, but it's fiddling with the other controls that is really irritating. Control for music off, lights on/off and rotation on/off all seem to be tied up in two buttons. If you have the music and lights going, then turn on the rotation, the music and lights will go off as the rotation comes on. Then you have to press buttons in whatever order seems logical until you get them all going the way you want them. Please bear in mind I am NOT particularly daft - I managed to figure out my TIVO remote in a day or so - but the controls for this baby's musical mobile make no sense to me. I thought at first it was supposed to be deliberately challenging in order to stimulate 'baby's natural curiosity', but after two nights it really got on my nerves, and if I can't figure it out, I don't see how my one year old is supposed to. I can only think that there is something very screwed up with the circuitry in there.  --- I'm not dismissing this item all together. The music is lovely - not too simplified and not too electronic-sounding. The Minute Waltz is particularly nice (I've noticed my son scans for it). The lights are lovely too, and do look pretty when they're moving if you can stand the buzzing. My son has come to depend on the music to amuse himself with as he falls asleep. BUT, if you buy it, I'd recommend testing the buttons and the motorized rotator before screwing the very flimsy mobile pieces together in case you need to return it.
The author is a sociologist and tells of testing the opinions of two groups as to OJ's guilt. [There was no test as to the extent of their actual knowledge!] You won't learn anything new from this book. It has a long list of books on the subject, but the author gave no ratings or summaries on them. Were they all equal in quality? ---   --- The OJ case received more publicity than the Oklahoma City bombing or the Clinton impeachment. The National Association of Editors and Publishers has never told of the reasons for its play in the news. Could it have been intended as a distraction from other news? In May 1994 the newspapers carried stories on how North Korea was ready to attack and start a war; this was repeated weekly. In 1999 I read that President Carter had been sent on a diplomatic mission to North Korea (must have been a success, since the propaganda stopped). ---   --- Could the double murders in Brentwood have been well-publicized as a distraction? Isn't two murders a day the usual LA statistics? How many other waiters (just from Mezzaluna) were murdered each year? Are murders by organized crime often solved? ---  --- The book "Killing Time" noted that restaurants and health clubs (in LA and elsewhere) were often used a fronts for drug dealing and prostitution. If this explains the murders, you won't find much in this book. [My experience is that most white Americans made up their minds in June 1994 and never let the new facts interfere with their prejudgment.]
A few of my favorite painters are contemporaries of Still, so I saw it as my duty to see the Hirschhorn exhibition.  Well, I picked a dead day and had the show to myself and simply put I am now a fan.  The book is great and David Anfam's addition to the book is especially enlightening about the work of Still
I purchased two chairs, one for me and one for my husband. For me the chair is perfect. I weight about 110 but my husband who is about 270 it is not so good!! (Chair is way to small for him) I love it for myself because when I take my children to the beach it is very easy for me to carry along with all the other beach accessories!! I would recommend it for someone looking for a light weight chair that is easy to bring along places
I bought this same mattress in 2004 for my first son, and we never had any problems.  Easy to clean and firm; yet soft enough for my son to sleep through the night starting at 3 months.  When we were surprised at the news of a second, I bought this from Amazon on sale--the fabric design is different (blue and white checks), but otherwise it seems the same to me.  But one comment: if you don't get it on sale here you might try to buy it in store because the shipping is around $20.  It depends on what you're willing to pay for convenience
I love this carrier (I bought it in Feb 2007). My daughter loves it too. She can sleep very well in it. The only problem is it can only hold up to 22lb, while mine is already 17lb (she is only 3 months). I guess I don't have too much time to use it. If this company could develop a one which suits for big baby, I will definitely buy it. --- ji
I've had this for about a week, and it seems to be working very well. The "autoscan" feature is very nice since I seemed to forget to switch between "city" and "highway" with my older units. ---  --- The voice prompts are very clear, and the automute keeps the annoying beeps to a comfortable level. ---  --- I've had several radar detectors over the years, and this one certainly seems to be the best so far. It is also rated very highly in the amgazine articles I found
These are thin solid and dark patties that cook up tasteless, juiceless and unburgerlike in texture.  Completely unlike their advertising and unlike the regular beef patties sold at the supermarket.  I will never buy Omaha Steak products again. ---  --- Omaha Steaks' customer representatives are very nice however.  I wrote to them telling them about my experience and they said I could dump the scary meat and they would credit my card.  Thank you very much.
Incredibly useful!  Exactly what I need all in one place
haven't tried cooking with them yet. but they arrived quickly and are not damaged or bruised in any way. they are beautiful specimens. i immediately vacuum sealed and froze them
Guys I Cant Tell you how much u'll leave other software and stay with ableton ! rememeber Sky is the limite in ableton
We bought our Performer about 2 years ago from our local hardware store. It was the best purchase we ever made! Its a beautiful thing to have a charcoal grill with a gas ignition....about 15-20 minutes you're ready to grill. For the people who own a gas grill and are considering the Performer but are concerned about dealing with charcoal...its a piece of cake (we had our reservations too!) and you're going to wish you switched sooner. Food never tasted so good
Hello world,Wowee zowee, very "wacky" little gem. Remember seeing the cover when my Dad took me into the video store, I was around 6 or 7 and it stuck in my mind. When I was about 21 or 22 one of my friends flat buddies had it on Beta tape, so I borrowed it cause I still have a Beta(really shouldn't have mentioned that). A true slasher basher not for the timid, truly written and directed by booby hatch patients, and were they found the actors is beyond me! Filmed in georgeous New Jersey of course not far from the original Friday the 13th. Its a real winner!!! Creepiest Mom ever. Love her old dodge or plymouth?
The strawberry milkshake shower gel smells just like Bonomo turkish candy I bought when I was a kid. I like it but I think the shower gel is overrated due to exposure on QVC.  Other shower gels are creamier than this. I'll enjoy using this and the Eggnog then go back to making my own
I had high expectations when purchasing a laser range finder for use on the golf course. After a lot of research, I settled on the Pro Tour Laser.  --- As previous reviewers have stated, this unit is very hard to stabilize.  I have a feeling this is true of all lasers.  --- Even with supporting both elbows on the hood of a car I found this unit very hard to find yardages for objects beyond 150 yards paricularly when bright sunlight is present.  --- On the golf course, finding the flag and obtaining a yardage at longer yardages is almost impossible if there are objects behind the flag such as trees or landscaping.  --- This unit has been returned and I have gone to a standard handheld GPS instead. Once the center of the green is initially saved as a waypoint, this is a very reliable and quick method to get a yardage, you just have to convert feet or 1/100's of a mile into yards. I do this with a chart taped on the back of the GPS. Accuracy is about 2-4 yards which is good enough for anyone but a vey low handicapper.  --- I am staying away from a laser finder until golf courses uniformly put reflectors on their poles. 
WATCH IS A VERY STURDY AND WATER RESISTANT TIME PIECE HOWEVER, THE RESIN BAND IS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AT TIMES
If you are a Christian, this book isn't for you. It is full of blashphemy, concluding that we must "... forgive God" and that we must love God "... even if He isnt perfect". Kusher even has the will to say that "...God would not be God..." without our love for Him. At one point he reduces God to an aminal saying that in the garden of Eden, when God said "...let US make man in OUR image" he was speking to animals and creation. Kusher explains that God created the world, and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution. ---  ---   Since when was God in need of forgiveness? Isnt it that "... God so loved the world" and it wasnt us that loved God? I have no words in describing this book. It is full of error, because it does not base it self on the Gospel of Jesus Christ. All this book does is frees you from the thought that you are a sinner, and that it isnt your fault, and that actully you are a good person. Why do bad things happen to good people? Wrong question. There are no good people in the world in the first place. " for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God..." The world is in sin. The world DOES NOT HAVE GOOD PEOPLE!! Only by the grace of God, through faith in Jesus Christ you are made righteous. I beg you in the name of Jesus Christ to stay away from this book. It hasnt helped 4 million people, but it lied to them. Kusher, please turn from your ways and come to Jesus, then will you understand the life question "WHY"
When Foxfire first came out, I had no interest to watch it at all. Recently I became a huge Angelina Jolie fan. The main reason to watch the movie was her. Jolie is great as usual. She gives everything into her character and is very good. The reason that films like these don't get as much publicity as their male counterparts is because they are all are so stereotyped and labeled. And while the generalization about most "female bonding" films is true, the same could be said about the men. And what makes each film stand apart is the emotion and ideas of the characters. The plot is based on real life situations, and the characters and the charisma they deliver is what makes the film so liberating and exciting to watch. The girls are learning life lessons, growing up, experimenting, facing hard issues and learning to cope and understand each other.  ---  --- Angelina Jolie has some brilliant lines and poses as an almost Mother-like figure, affecting their lives forever, sheltering and explaining, and persuading the girls to take an extra risk, or risks, rather. It's very intimate and she does an incredible job playing "Legs". It isn't meant to represent what all girls do, and don't bother looking for a movie about lesbians guys. It gets very ethereal at points and made a point about bonding and unity. Don't bother looking for deep intellectual comments either, because the most poignant scenes are sullen and the actresses use their eyes over words.  ---  --- The opening scenes are good, the way they introduce the oppressed victims, and you see the wide-eyed looks as are often given by people who are afraid - but who will later look for comfort in Legs and her new-found posse. It is all set up very well. And the touching ending scenes provide closure, showing how very real, and sincere, everything has been. It's not sugar coated in any way and let's you take a glimpse into a female perspective that does not revolve around whether or not they have a boyfriend, and whether their hair and make-up look okay. And if at least 1 girl can watch a movie like that, or read a book like that, and be inspired enough to raise her self-esteem and not let anyone walk over her, then it has made a good impact. After all, it's simply not often movies about self-proclaiming girls rebelling get in this much of a spotlight, right?
I bought this shaver about one year ago. For years I was using Braun shavers and was happy with them but decided to try competition. In spite of few people on internet who mentioned short lifespan I gave Panasonic a try. ---  --- Shaving is fine, it runs quiet and you get 5-7 shaves with one charge.  After about one year it started making strange noise and you get only 3-4 shaves with one recharge. Month later slowly went dead. Exactly as some other people wrote on bulletin boards, what make me to believe to those people writing reviews.  ---  --- You would expect more shave for $100. Today I went to buy Braun shaver.
The performance given by Poitier will not dissappoint. This movie version of the play is done from the view point of the son as oppossed to the view point of the mother, Lena. This work is timeless
I took Passion RX because I am 31 years old and have a very low sex drive and no passion. I had great success the first week I took this product. In fact I was so pleased, I bought 2 more bottles. However, the second week, I went back to having no sex drive. And even though I am continuing to take Passion RX, it has not had any effect whatsoever since the first week.  I take 2 pills each day in the morning, and have done so for over a month.  I suppose everyone is different but I won't purchase any more. Plus I just saw a webpage from Consumer Health Digest that gives it low rating compared to other products: http://consumerhealthdigest.com/top25female.htm?source=overute/Passionrx&OVRAW=passion%20rx&OVKEY=passion%20rx&OVMTC=standar
I am amazed. My mom sent this to me after I'd complained about already being eaten alive by mosquitos this year. I don't just get bites; I get huge, oddly shaped, so-itchy-they're-almost-painful, welts. And I am that person who attracts every single biting insect. I have often wished that I sweated DEET. However, I don't. ---  --- I tried this dubiously, first in the morning--I'd been getting bites every day between 8 and 10am (even with high % deet). --No bites.-- I still didn't believe it. I used it again that evening--after a rainstorm had come through--from about 6pm to 10pm. No bites! It comes with a belt clip, but I left it outside at one point when I came inside. The second I left its side, a mosquito landed on me. ---  --- I have, since then, used it several more times, no insect spray at all, and it's been very muggy around here. Absolutely no bites. I have seen a couple more bees than usual, and it turns out that the ingredient this blows out (geraniol) is said to attract bees. Not a big deal to me. ---  --- It apparently doesn't work for everyone. I have always assumed that there is some sort of chemical I give off that makes mosquitos head straight for me, bypassing everyone else. (I might be at a party where no one else even sees a mosquito and I leave with over a dozen bites.) I wonder if the geraniol somehow combines with whatever it is that I put out and neutralizes it. This could explain why it would work for some people and not other people. ---  --- At this price, it's worth it to find out if you are one of the people for whom it might work! I figure if I replace the cartridge every 2 weeks (~$3.50/cartridge), I will even be saving money because I'd been going through 1-2 cans of high-deet bug spray per week
Whatever product Sony brings to the market, you can always be sure that you are buying a Top Quality Product, and these sony memory card for PS2 is just the perfect exampl
We ordered the double stroller because it had really good reviews and it sounded like it would fit us perefctly. --- Our children are 2.5 and 10 months.  Our 2 year old has almost outgrown the back as her head is higher than the back support.  Also with in 6 months we had two different stollers because both has issues with the rain shield,and peek a boo window cracking, also the black out line seam came apart from the red fabric.  The kickers was when we pick up our stroller from from the airport in Mexico and the latch mechanism gave away when  my two kids were in it.  It cloapsed because the locking system melted..... oops, I guess someone forgot to check that on part of the test!!
Ok good CD. im not suprised. Ok jaheim may not have the b best voice but his music is good and it goes will with the voice that he has.  Yes yall this album does use profanity but the songs actually have meanings. I like that daddy thing song, and like a dj. This album looks at issues from a mans  point of view. Ya know we've heard the angry woman and how the man did t his and that now jaheim looks at it from a males view. Ok yall i know he is not the first one to do this but he did it well. Also this is a break from that [...] that is played on the radio.
Good quality. Beautiful color. However had a side zipper which my husband didn't like as much as a top zipper
My 13 yr old wanted this and a waveboard for Christmas.  Since his dad and I are divorced, he ended up with both.  I got him the flowboard and he LOVES it.  Of course, I tried it too and was shocked to find it was actually easier for me to play with than his regular skateboard.  There is no chance I'm even going to try the waveboard, as I do value my intact bones.  I've been wanting to learn how to snowboard and this definitely gives the feeling of snowboarding, but without the snow!  It's well made, fun and definitely a hit
WOW! I couldnt believe that they actually made a hitch for my sports car. The car manual said that it is not possible to put a hitch on the RX8, but I really wanted one to accomodate my hitch bike rack. I ordered this one and it fit perfectly - in fact the holes in the hitch mounting bar lined up with holes already in the car frame, like the car was designed to accept this hitch! It only took me about one hour to install - didnt even have to remove the tires or jack the car up! Very easy installation
This figure is one of the best in the marvel legends series. I have over forty of the marvel legends figures and this is the tallest. The hair on his body looks real and his joints aren't to tight, but not to lose either their just right. I couldn't wait for them to release more Exiles members like Noctourne, Blink, Morph, & Mimic. I wasn't very happy to see the marvel legends series coming to an end with the seperation of marvel from Toy Biz the last series are going to be realeased later this year. I'm glad to see Psylocke & Falcon before the series end, but what about the wildly popular She Hulk. They've got the loser Sabertooth from the Exiles coming out, but not She Hulk. If you're going to bring an Exiles to the series at least bring characters we like. NOCTOURNE, MORPH, BLINK, MIMIC!!!! 
I really like this cd a lot and I am looking forward to seeing them live
people say that the iquest stinks because it doesn't have all their text books. but i honestly think that even though it may be a little different, there's no harm in learning new things.
Buy the Baby Bjorn before you waste your time and money on this hunk of junk.  No matter how I tried, I couldn't wrap my baby to where I felt he was secure and safe and comfortable.  Plus, it took forever and my baby had no patience to wait for me.  By the time he was in, he wanted out
QBQ! by John Miller is simply amazing. This little book is a grand slam all the way! QBQ strips away all the excuses and reminds us again where it is the buck is supposed to stop. If you're looking for an instruction manaual for leaders, here it is. People don't need tricks, methods, myths or secrets...what they really need is a tool that helps them step up to the plate and be accountable for their own results. One of the biggest weaknesses of the American workforce is the ability to accept responsibility and accountability for our own actions.   Bravo for QBQ
I didn't use this particular product but the version that came with my computer which was slow but not the end of the world. The problem I had with them is that they aoutomatically renew your subscription without giving any warning that they are going to do it. I had a 2-year subscription and they send me an e-mail 2 years later saying they charged my account with never telling me that I was in auto enrollment! When I called to complain they of course had someone who couldn't inderstand me and I had to spell my e-mail address THREE times and was told it would take 3-5 days for the refund to be processed which is crap because I work for an online store and its easier to void a sale and cheaper for the vendor to do a refund the same day! I asked for a manager TWICE, the second time they came back they had the nerve to ask me if I was interested in an upgrade and subscribing to their magazine, and was put on the never-ending hold until I gave up 37 minutes later which was probably the plan all along. SO I called my bank and put a stop payment on the automatic payment. Now I am searching for another protection program and calling their customer service before my purchase to see how it goes
If I could give it a zero or negative rating I would.  When VIBE was introduced, it was a relevant, interesting magazine that exposed me to new alternative, r&b and hip hop artists.  The mag featured all kinds of artists not just who's hot right now, it also featured hard hitting expose articles that were relevant to not only the hip hop community but the world. ---  --- Lately I've noticed that it's nothing more than a fluffy version of The Source.  I hate a lot of new rap music that's out and didn't appreciate mags with rappers I dislike on the cover. And is it me or does it seem like since Mimi took over, all of the female r&b singers' covers and stories are HORRIBLE (we won't even discuss that disgusting Brandy cover)! ---  --- This magazine SUCKS now and the only time I check it out is while I'm in line at the grocery store.  Yes, the subscription rates are cut to the bone now but that is because the quality is supremely lacking.  I'd advise the curious to check issues out at newstands or where ever before wasting your hard earned money on a subscription
NO eye piece cover - you put your eye on a hard surface --- hard to focus --- hard to find objects --- I lost a pair similar to these that were much better
IT was advertised and NOT IN STOCK so I was unable to get it
We were extremely disappointed with this toy that we bought as a Christmas present for our four year old son.  The parking garage came with pre-drilled holes and needed to be assumbled.  Unfortunately, due to poor quality, the pieces did not line up correctly and we needed to sand some of them down in order to make the toy functional.  It would also have been helpful for the manufacturer to include one or two spare screws in case they got lost or destroyed during assembly. 
I do like this t-shirt.  I liked the organic cotton and the general style.  But I will never buy American Apparel again.  Not only are they VERY labor and union unfriendly, their ads exploitive of young girls (I mean, I can tolerate some of the young models in general, but these are particularly young girls in amature porn-looking situations), but a friend's daughter had a particularly unsavory experience working in one of their stores.   ---  --- I know I can find a cosy organic shirt elsewhere.  ick
I ordered this brand because it had the least amount of sugar. --- The cherries were gritty (dirty?, sand?) and did not have the tart taste of locally purchased dried cherries.  Now I'm stuck with a whole box of them that no one in my family wants to eat
If you don't need outlook but do need powerpoint, this is a great value.  Before, you had to be a student or teacher to get a good price (full retail $150 now).  Office 2003 standard even on eBay is still going for $175 plus.  This does not offer anything much beyond Office 2003 but the new ribbon format is not difficult to learn.  Also, don't worry about file formats.  You can re-set the default format to prior formats so that anything you send out can be read by earlier versions of Microsoft Office. 
I have never written a review like this before but felt compelled to do so in this case. Those considering purchase of this printer should be aware that the claim that it will work with pict bridge connections is NOT true. I purchased this for my wife thinking that it would be a nice compact simple printer to operate where we could easily print pictures of the grandkids. She and I both have newer Nikon digitals and the pictbridge connection will not work with mine at all. With hers, we can make a connection and, following drections carefully, we can get it to 'energize' the printer but the printer will only print intermittent photos and not of good quality. The printer will not pull the paper though properly. (We have even changed batteries in the camera to no avail and had a tech savvy son-in-law look at it.) I read reviews by others, but feel this printer is simply not reliable. I wanted to share our bad experience with those of you evauating a purchase. ---  --- In my opinion, Canon should be more forthcoming with claims about interface with other cameras. I'm in the process of trying to return it to Amazon. We're going to buy an HP, which I should have done initially. ---  --- Thank you
people this is easy listening at it's easiest. Every song is and will be a candidate for adult contemperary rotation in 2 years, that is if it isn't allready. I don't know anything about what they have done in the past, except for a song I remember being played on the radio a few years ago. Must have been on the album prior to this. But that song sounds just like two tracks on this one. Not only that but if there wasn't a pause in between these mini mediocre fests I couldn't really tell any of them apart. Horrible music with no feeling or soul, not even creative. don't waste your time with this.
We got this in lieu of another similar one because it was in stock, but lo and behold it only lasted a week. Our son lays on his back and kicks everything in his crib, so when he kicked this, the knob securing it to the crib through the strap broke off. Luckily the broken piece fell on the floor and not into his crib, where it could have posed a choking hazard! Pass on this and get a Fisher Price one - Ocean Wonders or the one we got, Flutterbye Dreams, which he loves
This weight bench is too short and is almost impossible to use in a completely horizontal postion. You would have to be a little kid for it to work. After working along time to put it together I found neither me nor my 6'2" kid could use it effectively
The product came well-packaged and unopened. I really needed instructions on how to open the packaging. But once I got it opened and installed, the product works as well as promised. The set-up and ribbon menu is a lot more user-friendly than 2003. I downloaded the trial version that Microsoft had offered, and I must say that this is the best Office product offered by Microsoft to date
For the last 15 years I have been a manual razor user.  I decided to try an electric razor and after researching found the Norelco 7745X to be just what I wanted.  I can say that I am glad I did.  It is very quiet and the lotion dispenser definitely makes shaving a joy
Christmas morning, my daughter tears the paper off this toy and is soooo exited. What a disapointment. Nothing I did caused the tail to wag, the leg to move and no licking action. I changed the batteries, still nothing. After hours of trying to get it to work, I went on line here and read somebody elses review about rubbing under the collar VERY HARD. Finally, the tail wagged, the foot moved and then, it actually licked. What a piece of work, very cute but WAY too much work. In time, I will eventually rub all the fur off under the collar. Save your money
If you want your child to know the true & Bibical account of Jesus' birth...the shepherds came first! --- An angel announced His birth the shepherds hurried to see Mary, Joseph & baby Jesus. --- They were first on the scene. Some chronicle the kings coming as much as three years later. --- I will return my three sets & order the one with the bells & whistles AND two shepherds!!
Boring, tasteless and unoriginal. Photographer has an obvious fixation...which has kept him from paying attention in many cases to contrast, tone, and line. One star for the big you know what, the real model here. I'm sure book has its merits, but they aren't artistic. Putting my copy up for sale
I wanted it for my collection, however you can sift through all the youtube stuff and end up with the same video for free if you want to do the work
Expensive, but a small amount makes a big difference. Excellent conditioner for dry, thick hair. Also, very pleasing fragrance. The best hair treatment I've found for my straight, coarse, dry hair. Highly recommended
I was deeply dissapointed in this lens hood.  Given that the cost is about 10% of the cost of the lens for which it was intended (the 70-300 IS in this case) I expected it to be of stiff durable polycarbonate.  ---  --- -Positives- --- fulfills the basic function of a lens hood- prevents flare, etc. ---  --- The bayonet locking system is excellent, much easier to deal with than scew-on type lens hoods. ---  --- that's about it. ---  --- -Negatives- --- The polycarbonate is so thin I half expect it to be translucent. ---  --- The hood must be gripped by the base to remove it, as grippng the thin end of the hood may break it; or at least it feels like it may break it. ---  --- Its very long.  Especially on the 70-300 which is already a long lens, this makes a fully extended zoom about a foot long.  That's pretty conspicuous. ---  --- It's very overpriced vs. generic lenses ($50 vs. $5-10 for rubber or metal). ---  ---  --- I traded it in and went with a kalt rubber lens hood.  2 stars for the great bayonet design, but the rest of it is weak
I bought the 3.5 x 5.5 ruled pocket version. By my standards, the best notebook I've ever used. The perfect size for my jacket or pocket. Acid free paper for long-term archival storage of my notes. Good to use an acid free ink for even longer storage (gel ink pens do not work well with the Moleskine's paper though). Looks professional, and I get a lot of nice comments about it. Much easier to use than turning on my PDA and slowly typing in notes with my thumbs. I also really like the fact that it will open completely flat on a table for easier note writing and reading. When this one is full, I plan to buy another. Price is higher than most, but with this Moleskine, you pay for the quality
The oil must be removed through the oil drain to properly evacuate the contaminated oil from the crank case. And the oil filter must be replaced to prevent contamination of the new oil.  ---  --- Maybe you'll find this product wonderful and a cost-effective alternative, what do you do with the oil syphoned from the engine? A small but important cost of the oil change at a garage is for disposal of the oil.
Let me first say that I did not purchase this mini stepper through Amazon, but rather directly from the Discovery Channel Store. Two weeks after I submitted my review of their product on their web site, however, they still have not seen fit to post it. ---  --- I used the Discovery Electronic Mini Stepper daily for 29 days (30 minutes per day) before the cable around the pulley-wheel broke. This seems to be a consistent problem with this piece of equipment, judging by previous reviews on the DCS (Discover Channel Store) web site. Being inside the 30 day return window, I sent my stepper back for a refund. Customer service, I must say, was excellent...only the product itself was cheap and substandard. ---  --- On a related note, this is the third mini stepper (various brands, not all DCS) I have owned in the past year. They have all broken down in one way or another. Feel free to look at some of my previous reviews here to get the details, but the bottom line is that this will be my last mini stepper. ---  --- Take some advice from me when I say that these machines are built for people who are beginners in the world of fitness. That is to say, if you intend to use a mini stepper two or three days per week for 15-20 minutes, then you may be satisfied with one. However, if you are at an advanced or even intermediate stage in your workout routine, then don't even consider one of these machines - you will destroy it, trust me. There's just too much that can go wrong -- pulleys cracking, pulley cables breaking, shocks leaking...and I actually broke the frame of one stepper. Through all of this, I have learned one important lesson about exercise: keep it simple. I am now having great success with some simple resistance bands (many varieties are available here at Amazon) and cardiovascular exercises (e.g. regular old jumping-jacks). I get a better workout than any I ever got from a mini stepper, and I'm feeling great and even lost a little weight in the right places :-) ---  --- Honestly, if you want to save yourself some grief, please learn from my experiences and avoid the horrible cycle of mini stepper destruction. Just buy yourself some resistance bands, maybe a jump rope, an exercise mat, an instructional video/book, and then get to work. Exercising to tone your body and lose weight isn't easy (and if it is, then you're probably not doing it right), but you can make it easier by not wasting your time and money on junk like this
What a joke, not worth the money. I put it in the container to pull out the oil and it dies half way through. Swapped batteries, pulled it out, washed it and looked at all the parts. It was either used and resold to me by amazon, or it was defective from the start. And since they have a 30 day return policy, I am now stuck with it, I will see what eastman says next. VERY disappointing, I will go back to the old way of just pouring it into a funnel with a coffee filter in it
I bought Bead Fantasies and Bead Fantasies II at the same time after reading the positive reviews; I wish I had looked at these books before buying. There are pretty motifs that I will incorporate into my beading projects but I find the small typed directions overly simplistic and the diagrams are too small. I'm glad this isn't my first beading book or I would feel totally discouraged from trying any of these projects. I won't be buying Bead Fantasies III.  The Art and Elegance of Beadweaving and Coraling Technique remain my favorite beading books. --- 
Polanyi sets forth an incredibly relevant, radical, and all too plausible theory in this book. ---  --- Going beyond a mere analysis of how the market system functions, Polanyi endeavors to answer the question as to how the market came about. Polanyi's answer will not be pleasing to libertarians, he argues that a free land and labor market can only come about through government intervention, and must be sustained through further intervention. He also argues that the market ransforms the nature of social relations. Usually, economic relations were a result of social relations, under the market, it is the latter. ---  --- Polanyi attempts to show how a market for land and labor came about in Britain. His argument that government "enclosures" created it through dislodging the poor and turning their land into sources of economic production is convincing. However, other arguments Polanyi advances simply demonstrate a central government repealing the interventions of subaltern governments. ---  --- Polanyi's argument that there was no "rent-seeking" (he doesn't use that term) involved in the enactment of state intervion in the economy ("proving" that this intervention was objectively necessary is suspect. One 19th century investigators conclusions don't serve to overturn the implications of public choice theory. ---  --- The greatest problem with this book is that Polanyi doesn't do too much to back up his arguments. He fortunately has a section called "notes and sources" where he lists his research material, but I'd wager that most of this is difficult to find 60 years later
I was very hesitant to purchase this bike because of all the problems other people reported with parts coming damaged/rusty. The only problem I had was the bar on the rear-bottom wouldn't fit all the way into the slot to put one of the screws in. I tried really hard to get it in, but it just wouldn't budge. Luckily, I could get the screw in on the other end, so it is relatively secure.  --- The bike is a bit wobbly when your riding - now I don't know if this is because of my problem with the bar, or because that's just the way it is. but I don't feel like it's going to fall apart or tip over or anything. --- Over all, this is a really nice bike. The price is absolutely the best for what you're getting - especially if you choose the free super saver shipping. I got mine about a week from the day I ordered it. I don't think you will find another bike comparable to this for the price. Most recumbent bikes at this price don't offer any kind of resistance, what to speak of programs or the pulse monitor.  --- It is really quiet - I can do it at 5 in the morning while my daughter is sleeping in the next room and not have to turn the TV up too loud. The seat is a bit uncomfortable, but it's not that big of a deal considering the price
I used it in Brasil and had it developed.  I was very happy with it.  It was the very first time I've used a digital camera
This are excellent and I can dry my SUV with all three easily.  After a few wrings with each towel they begin to get too wet to dry efficiently.  I definitely recommend it for the DIY car detailers
Had this set of speakers for close to a year now. They really are nothing special for the price. ONE problem is when running them on battery the signal seems to drift (if you lock in a signal at all)! They do come with power cord to plug each speaker into AC. I have outside wiring so this is no trouble. TWO if you walk between the transmitter and the speeakers the music cuts out.If you plan to buy these and run them on battery alone, and mounting them in a high traffic area (I mounted mine high above head level), DON'T PURCHASE THEM
As a beef eating Hindu I am very much interested in finding how cows became holy for Hindus and beef a forbidden thing to eat. I browsed through this book in a book store and found it to be very disappointing. ---  --- First, it appeared to be intended more for creating controversy than for informational purposes. It clearly had a bias which turned me off. ---  --- Second, I am generally up-to date on current issues and remembered that it did not generate all that controversy as mentioned on the cover of the book. There were some rumblings but nothing of the sort described on the covers ("the government of India demands be ritually burned"). ---  --- Later I searched on google with the book title and words "ban", "government of India" and found no news reports relating any government of India attempts at banning this book. There were no reports on ban by Allahabad High Court either. All I found were book reviews on the book and other articles written mainly by political commentators known for their leftist opinions.  ---  --- Third, I found some material on internet on how the author misinterpreted much of the scriptures to support his conclusions. ---  --- It basically left me disappointed and I am still searching for some reliable and accurate material on this matter. --- 
The chocolate war ---  --- The chocolate war was one of the best books I have ever read...NOT! The chocolate war portrayed a very inappropriate scene. The boy jerry was supposed to sell chocolates but refused, but the book sidetracks and talks about naughty things and also swears a lot. I would not recommend this book because it seemed inappropriate. I don't think that this book should be available to children at a middle school level. This story might be better if the bad words and other bad things war taken out. I think that the story line seems great when jerry denies selling the chocolates because of Archie. Archie is a suspicious character that knows every one. I wish this book was more school appropriate, but it isn't and was a horrid book. Therefore, this book would be great if the author published a book with the Sam story but more school appropriate situations and words
These are very nice quality and comfortable. Everything was as expected and came in just a few days
The problem with Computer Shopper is, it's neither a serious trade magazine like PC Mag, or a shopper's paradise like its former self was.  If you want hardware tips, Maximum PC is way better.  You can find pretty much everything in Computer Shopper for free on the web ..
So delicious and so healthy.  Fresh and crunchy - much better than peanuts.  I love these soy nuts
I was very happy with the previous model DSC-N1, which took very nice pictures just with pointing and shooting. But this one, while I only had chance to use it indoors and outdoor in raining weather, it really disappointed me. The pictures are always blured due to too much exposure, I used auto flash, for which the camera should takes nice pictures as it  is a point and shoot camera and it is 10.1MP!  ---  --- I'm going to try more when the weather gets better but most possible I will return it, I just can't accept the quality of the indoor pictures it takes. I doubt I was unlucky and got a bad one, I can't believe a 10.1MP sony camera takes so poor pictures. And after reading the previous review about the terrible Sony custmer servce, I decide I will avoid Sony customer service, and the camera will just be returned.   ---  --- Note: Found the review by Cecelia Choy "cece" on March 13, 2007 mentioned the same problem I had. I didn't have this problem with my previous model DSC-N1.  ---  --- April 17, 2006: I bought a new one and it takes nice pictures now! Suggestion for those having the same problem I had before -- exchange for another one!!
Though still not quite enough battery for the juice-sucking Q, it is worlds better than the included battery.  I would love to see a clip on the back to attach the original battery as well to swap when the extended one dies
If you don't use this phone, it costs $3/month.  Normal hours til 9 p.m. it's 12 cents per minute, which is a bit less than half of what most prepaid phones cost.  Perfect for my occasional use and for locating family members when I'm in transit and feel that I simply must know where they are and what they are doing.  I don't use cell phones much, but if I must have one, I might as well have one that doesn't make me worry about another huge bill.  For kids who think they can mangle the budget, forget it cuz when the card is used up -- that's it kiddo.  Once they use up the card, the only number they can dial is 911, but that's it.  Bonus features: clock is always accurate and it has a great alarm which tells me when to get up to go to work and another to tell me when to go home at the end of the day.  At some point, I might not be able to live without this. 
I actually got the Snug Tub Deluxe.  This version comes with inflatable rings that baby can stack on the inflatable post.  It also has an attached inflatable fish that wheezes when you squeeze it.  I used it for the first time tonight and my 6 month old baby enjoyed the freedom to splash and play.  My only caution is to use something to keep baby from slipping.  I put her baby sponge underneath her to elevate her and propr her up.  This was also good to lean her back to wash her hair and to keep her from slipping.  I'm glad I bought this instead of the EuroBath
This mag is for people who think they are computer experts because they can change out a video card or follow directions on changing an OS setting. ---  --- Shallow coverage, and some of the lamest humor you will ever come across. ---  --- It is nothing more then a rehash of what is freely and easily available on the internet. There is nothing original in this mag, ever. Also it tends to copy and paste much of the issue from 12 months earlier. All the main articles are nearly the same every 12 months. Don't believe me? Take two magazines that are 12 months apart and compare them. ---  --- The reviews are also weak. nearly every month you will see: THE FASTEST SYSTEM WE EVER TESTED!!!!! YAAAAAWWWWWWNNNNN. Who cares? Anyone who knows even the slightest about computers knows that speed is not the most important attribute, even for gamers. Besides, does it really matter that system y is .00005% faster on their poor testing system then computer z? ---  --- The second star is for Mr Halfhills column. It is the only part that is consistantly interesting and the only person there with real technical know-how. ---  --- Read toms hardware and whatever tech news you want, learn how to use search engines, and skip this pointless mag
This works pretty well to get back and forth between classes, although you can tell that it's a toy at heart. If you're looking for something fun and easy, I recommend this scooter
i've used this cream for years.  i like the way it feels and makes my skin look.  i'd recommend it to anyone. 
I love this item.  We bought 2 cases for our sons before we left for vacation.  It can hang from the seats but they just held them on their lap or layed it on the couch in the van.  The boys arranged everything in the case so the battery even fits in it.  I was glad about that.  I'd recommend this item.
This is another wierd book by Shirley MacLaine: it is neither interesting nor a helpful guide book for pilgrims. The book is just a long rambling new age rant, published because the auther is "Shirley MacLaine".  Too bad really. Don't waste your money on this one.
A time saver.  Slap in on while still wet right after your shower; instant moisturization if you've got to jump in, jump out, and go.  And it smells delicious
Once you get used to all of the keys being flat, it plays well.  I like to put it in my backpack to take to school, or to play in the park
Tastes just like the red curries you get at a Thai Restaurant.  Add more or less depending on your spice level.  Not salty at all.  Flavor is great.  Mix with some vegetables, tofu, and coconut milk to make an amazing Thai meal at home
Okami rates among the most beautiful games I've ever seen.   ---  --- The main point of the game is that you're the reincarnation of a god, awakened after a hundred years to dispatch of the evil that's overtaken the land. The entire landscape is bleak and dead--affected by the evil, and it's your task to both fight the ultimate evil, and restore the land using various techniques you learn throughout the game.  ---  --- One of the really interesting aspects of the game is that, since the main character is folk tale diety (in the form of a wolf), the player can affect the environment of the game by drawing with a calligraphy brush. A circle stroke in the sky creates a sun to turn night into day. Another stroke across a dead tree brings it bursting into full bloom. A slashing stroke across your enemies cuts them.  ---  --- My only minor complaint so far is that perhaps it does a little too much shepherding in terms of letting you know where to go next. However, this doesn't detract for the game overall. At the same time, the player does have a good deal of freedom--I haven't felt railroaded through the storyline at all.  Perhaps the extra guidance will make this game more accessible also for people who aren't usually gamers.   ---  --- If you're looking for something visually interesting, occasionally humorous, and with very different gameplay from the usual fare, Okami is highly recommended. 
Dont dwnld " Survivor, "Thunderstorms & Sacrifice" ". Its my fault for not reading the whole thing. you would think that the last episode would be the finale , but NO, its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4. I didnt even get a full 45 minute episode. No finale. I got rippped off. $1.99 dwnld not well spent. Dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending. Because they dont have that episode, not even the reunion show
ah... ---  --- um... ---  --- well, my brother picked this up not too long ago, and , well... --- it sucks! it's the WORST of the whole series! --- i thought it would have to do with the mask Michael wears in the others, but not a FICKEN THING!!!!!!!!!!!! ---  --- I gave it two stars because i liked the killing scene in the hospital, but then i took one because of how bad the rest was..
These pods perform poorly in my espresso machine while ground beans perform very well. It could be the filter for the pods but the espresso comes out uneven from the spouts and the flavor is not very strong
We got this for our 21-month-old boy, who LOVES music and was always trying to play his dad's guitars. It is the perfect size and looks just like his daddy's black accoustic. He absolutely loves it. The manufacturers were smart and put the tuning keys on the bottom of the neck, as not to draw too much attention (which helps maintain the life of the strings). My only complaint is that the bridge is not secured so it is always coming lose and falling into the body of the guitar. I keep intedning to superglue it on...Otherwise I think this is a great toy for toddlers who are into music.
IN A NUTSHELL: FAST - IDIOT PROOF - MADE FOR ON THE GO - 5 CALORIES ---  --- This is really a very handy way to have a refreshing drink ready to go when water is just too bland, by itself. ---  --- Just open the packet, empty the contents into a bottle of water [how much H2O according to your taste] and shake it up. Viola -- refreshment in an instant. Or, you can put the bottle [plastic] in the freezer and have an ice-cold lemonade later. ---  --- WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT -- ---  --- 'Crystal Light On The Go Packets Lemonade, Drink Mix' tastes great, has very few calories, is an ideal carbonated beverage alternative and most of all --- IT'S EZ TO MAKE ON THE GO - FAST. It's also rather reasonably priced. ---  --- MY ONLY RESERVATION -- ASPARTAME ---  --- Some people do have bad reactions to aspartame but most people know, by now, whether or not it affects them adversely. I would rather have 'Splenda' as the sweetener, but maybe that will be available soon. ---  --- Through Kraft, there is a neat website which contains nutritional and other info about Crystal Light -  [http://www.kraftfoods.com/CRYSTALLIGHT/] ---  ---  --- [I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY] ---  ---   --- 
Jeff Buckley sounds like what Marc Bolan would have sounded like if Bolan had taken Perry Como as his musical muse.  Seriously, think about Marc Bolan trying to sound like a '50's crooner and you'll know what Jeff Buckley sounds like
I absolutely am addicted to these.  I was taking Lipitor for my cholestrol and couldn't have pink grapefruit juice or eat pink grapefruit, which I absolutely love.  But these satisfied my craving for it completely plus it didn't interfere with the meds!  I brought the bag to work and put them in my candy jar on my desk and have gotten several other people hooked on them! They're the best
The band is excellent and this album is just shy of the high quality of the first.  However, the encroachment of our free use rights as legal consumers by the major record companies will not stop until they see a negative financial impact from pushing these copy crippled products. Don't support these products
The chair has simple pre-set programs (I basically use only the full-body massage), but also allows for designing your own massage by choosing specific movements and massage area.  ---  --- Of course it is not the same as a real massage and not as good as the $2,500 chairs, but offers a great way to relax your back muscles at a great value
Just started introducing the potty to my 19 month old and he loves to sit on it and "practice". So far so good......
I bought the DVD based on all the positive reviews, and I think prospective buyers should be warned that not everyone finds this a 5-star movie.  My husband and I, who love old movies, hated it.  My teenagers just found it completely uninteresting.  It was apparently made about the time Alaska became a state, although it deals with an earlier time period, and the movie has not aged well.  The story was uninteresting, the direction was uneven, the comedy (mostly bar fights) felt forced and awkward.  Stewart Granger did not seem to know what he was doing or why his character was there.  Fabian's acting was unmemorable and we felt Capucine was miscast.  We got bored and spent half the movie pointing out to each other how little the sandy beaches and desert terrain looked anything like Alaska (it was obviously shot in southern California).  I gave it two stars because I was able to sit through the entire thing, but I spent most of it asking myself "why?  Why am I wasting my time like this?
This little toy is cute. My 11 month old son LOVES BLues Clues and loves this toy. He will hold him on his lap while he watches his favorite show! Its really cute
Contrary to the product description, this stool is not heavy duty! The actual seat itself is made of very flimsy plywood, and any sort of bad posture or leaning forward will crack it and punch the metal supports through it! ---  --- The legs are also hard to adjust to optimum length, as the retention screw doesn't hold anything in place for long. If you can find something somewhere else, I say go for it
I read some of the other reviews before I submitted this.  I don't see how someone could get upset over the liner notes.  Redd doesn't include Danny Gatton as an influence because he didn't listen to him.  As far as other reviews concerning tone and the lack of fire, well, I don't even know how to address that.  Redd has one of the best tones I've heard on the tele and his note selection is what sets him apart from other pickers.  Ever hear of diarrhea of the guitar?  Well, you won't get that on this CD because Redd doesn't play something to just play it.  This CD showcases Redd's versatility from country, to swing, to blues, to rock, it has it all.  If you like good pickin', then by this CD
I bought the KR Party bundle for my boyfriend's daughter for her birthday. She loves the game, but it has only been about two weeks and the mic is dead. It started with the static for a while, but then while I was singing, it just died completely. I know I'm not a great singer, but I'm not THAT bad
I saw this movie for one reason: I wanted to see Gerard Butler in something other than Phantom Of The Opera just to see how he played a "normal" role. I've never been a big fan of "chick flicks" (for instance, my friend and I watched A Walk To Remember awhile ago, and the only thing that kept us from laughing throughout was the constant threat of being slapped by one of the girls in the room). That said, Dear Frankie is a thoroughly entertaining film that has a surprisingly deep plot and keeps going at a fast enough pace that you never get bored. Initially I had trouble understanding what the actors were saying (they all have thick accents), but once I got used to it I had no problems through the rest of the movie
Dull and uninspiring, listening to this CD I couldn't see what distinguished the Doves from the other insipid sound-a-like bands that plague the modern music scene. If you like The White Stripes, Franz Ferdinand, Arctic Monkeys, The Killers then be grateful that they've saved rock music from boring dross like this
I bought this game for an adult birthday party. It was a hit.   --- The game is very entertaining and it is easy to navigate through the game.  You have full control of the settings such as music level, vocals, crowd noise, etc.  You can also change the mode to the traditional Karaoke in which only the words are displayed on the screen. It's definitely for all ages even my two year old can't get enough of it. The selection of music is good. Be sure to have a memory card so you can save any characters you create and keep track of your performance for unlock hidden treasures such as extra songs and wardrobes
Was a subsciber for many years mainly due to extremely balanced reporting, indepth coverage, etc.  Then, starting about 1-2 years ago, the magazine started to take a "left" tilt.  (I do not consider myself "right wing", am registered as an independant, but do like fair balanced coverage in my news)  Since the beginning of this decline, the Atlantic has become more and more just another liberal magazine.  The bias has also led, as it always does, to less in-depth reporting, since they tend to now ignore any aspect of an issue that does not support the left bent.
These underpants are too bulky and puffy. My daughter was very uncomfortable wearing them
I've been a subscriber since right before the days of Bel Ami. I've never regretted a single issue, nor the investment.
I received this chair very quickly, even though it was close to Christmas. The chair was wonderful! Such a great price for such a great chair
I purchased this card a month ago. I use it on my Dell Axim X3i. So far it has been fully compatible, fast, and flawless. I haven't owned another PDA or SD card so I can't give you a first-hand benchmark. But I can say that accessing the card is quick and I have not had any skips while playing my music files. The 256MB is good for the price if you wait for Amazon to drop their price in conjunction with the manufacturer's rebate
DeYoung begins by relating how Bush pushed Powell out at the end of his 1st term, without the courtesy of even personally discussing it with him; making matters worse was the  fact that Bush didn't even know why Powell was at the White House when it came time to say "Good Bye." ---  --- Colin Powell came from Jamaican parents (often called "Jewmaicans" by American Negroes because of the emphasis they placed on hard work and education), and during his early life in the NYC area suffered little, if any, racial prejudice.  Later on, unfortunately, the insults were quite aggravating, but Powell was determined to not let them inhibit his performance. ---  --- Powell was an indifferent student in high school and at CCNY (majored in geology); however, ROTC piqued his sophomore-year interest and he soon became a standout.  Powell went on to be selected outstanding cadet, and top graduate (or very close) in every military training setting he undertook, as well as a top MBA student at George Washington University.  He also was top-ranked by superiors in almost every military assignment, leading to his being offered a White House fellowship, which in turn provided Powell with travel to Russia and China and brought him in contact with a number of influential people who were impressed enough to forward Powell onto Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, National Security Advisor, and Secretary of State. ---  --- One of Powell's "secrets of success" was to enthusiastically implement all orders, even those he considered silly - Powell himself believed that doing otherwise grounded the careers of many talented others. ---  --- Unfortunately, Powell eventually crossed paths with Dick Cheney (a bit of a problem during Gulf War I; a serious problem when Cheney became V.P.).  Between Cheney's far-right bias ("out on the looney fringe" - per Powell) and Bush II's "disturbingly disjointed" decision-making - per Treasury Secretary O'Neill), Powell's contributions as Secretary of State were severely limited and constantly undermined and countermanded - often with Don Rumsfeld's help.  In addition, he was often left out of important decisions, especially when out of the country.  Ultimately, Powell's credibility suffered from the inaccurate information provided in his U.N. speech attesting to Saddam's WMD. ---  --- The big question, still debated, is "Why didn't he resign?"  His supporters believe the reason is that Powell's nature simply didn't allow anything less than 100% support. ---  --- Bottom Line:  If Cheney had not been such an ideologue (telling Bush there were no candidates good enough to run as his V.P. - ignoring Powell, and then sliding into the position himself), Powell would be V.P. today, possibly President in 2008.  Similarly, if Bush #41 had not been so stubborn and instead replaced Quayle with Powell in '92, Powell might well have become first V.P., and then President
Never had I been so unhappy with my makeup as I was when I was using Clinique. I used Stay Beige (which I lightly patted on my face on top of Clinique's superfit liquid makeup - I have oily skin and was told this would help reduce the shine) and the end result was that it just made me look ghostly. I also hated how Clinique's liquid foundation and powder didn't have matching shades, so that I had to settle for Honey in the liquid and Beige in the powder. As much as I went back to Macy's to try to convince them that these weren't my shades, they just wouldn't listen. Either they didn't have the time or the patience to help me pick a new shade, or they were convinced I was making a big deal out of nothing. Instead of sitting there and arguing with them (which I shouldn't have to do in the first place) I just switched to a different makeup line: Laura Mercier, which I am VERY happy with. ---  --- I've had many other friends who were unhappy with Clinique and switched over to a different makeup brand, as well. I'm not trying to knock the product. I'm just saying it wasn't for me or for many of the other people I know. I would definitely NOT recommend Clinique to anyone. I'd rather pay a little more and get better results rather than settle for a $20 product just because it's affordable.
This is a great deal. This is a GREAT price... great glow... and quick delivery. I highly recommend this product
I was recently in the play Alladin, and whenever there was a break, the whole cast would gather to play "Encore."  We used songs from the musical we were in-and talk about a boatload of laughs! It's a blast!  Everyone loves it, because everyone gets involved, and has a great time.  This is a fabulous party game!  Buy it now
I watched this with some trepidation, and I have to say it was both better and worse than I thought it would be.  It was better because it remained fairly true to the original, in terms of retaining the multiple conflicting story lines and the ambiguous ending.  It was worse because the attempts at erotica were less entertaining than the original, and I found Stone's lampshade hairstyle oddly distracting. ---  --- A couple of things kept me viewing this DVD.  One was the London setting, which gave me an opportunity to see what time has done to one of my old home towns.  The other was Sharon Stone's rather plucky performance, and the presence of Charlotte Rampling, who has aged into a different kind of beauty.  Morrisey doesn't even come close to filling Michael Douglas's shoes, and it's hard to feel sorry for him at the end. ---  --- As with the first movie, you are left with the feeling that there was a better film waiting to be made.  The basic idea of a psychotic novelist who feels compelled to act out her fantasies in real life is an intriguing one.  However, both movies were quick to abandon Hitchcockian understatement for speeding cars and gratuitous sex.  There's nothing wrong with either of these things, but here they just get in the way
These speakers deliver a clear, crisp, and vibrant sound, with a richness expected of a higher-end speaker.  I would recommend these to anyone interested in a good-quality sound but keeping an eye on price
We must thank the director and salute Sigourney Weaver's beautiful performance: this movie gives us a rare insight into the lives and minds of the gentle, yet ferocious, giant mountains gorillas. It is also the amazing journey of an extroardinary woman who went to live by herself in a remote mountain of Rwanda, secluded from the world. She lost much of her sanity, as well as her life, in the process of saving the lives of a few hundred remaining gorillas. Without her work, who knows who could have saved them from savage murder and total extinction? Thanks to her work and dedication, a "lost cause" had been heard at last.  ---  --- The struggle for the survival of the "Great Apes" is not totally over though. One must hope that the abject poverty and the political unrest that still affect the region, as well as the illegal poaching and smuggling of goods and animals across borders - that happen with or without government officials' approval in each country involved - and the continuing deforestation and fauna's loss of habitat, can one day all come to an end so that the survival of these amazing creatures can be achieved.  ---  --- One must recognize the sacrifices and thank people like Diane Fossey, conservationists around the world, and the Rwandese people in particular, who have made it possible so far despite great internal economic and political pressures. All hope is not lost!
As ex-infantry I found this a big disappointment and almost unwatchable. This low budget movie spoils the book. A supposed highlight is the SAS field craft, but that's a bad joke. The SAS troop crowds around for camera shots, all the while talking loudly if not shouting. Bog normal infantry don't do this never mind the best of the best, the SAS. The fire-fight sequences are passable. The interrogation is the strongest part of the movie but can't make up for the rest of it. The foul language Even if it's what they used in the field, should have been ameliorated for the movie and it detracts a lot, making it unsuitable for many audiences
This lens has extremely fast (and quiet) focus, and is razor sharp.  What more could you want, when photographing wildlife up close
It has a clean soap smell! I also recommend the volume shampoo & conditioner it made my hair feel very soft
I bought this item based upon the reviews i read and i must say it lived up to the reviews.  It did the job. I bought this late in the summer but the one time i used it i was impressed by the amount of bugs that it zapped in a short space of time. I saw and felt the effectiveness of the product because i stayed in the backyard longer than usual
After having plastic tags crack and break off my suitcase, a leather bag tag is what i needed.  They stay on the suitcase and don't break
I enjoyed playing this game, when it would let me...the amount of bugs in this game is downright outrageous, crashes left and right.  It was a good story though.  I suppose I could give you a few tips... --- To stop the Dantooine framerate from dropping, go to the folder where your game files are ex. c:/program files/lucasarts/swkotor2, and open the swkotor2.ini file (on my xp the icon was a notepad with a cogwheel over it), and under the [Graphics Options] heading insert a line and type: --- Disable Vertex Buffer Objects=1 --- That should get rid of any bad framerate drops on Dantooine and at least make it playable. --- Also, I had a glitch near the end of the game where I went back to Dantooine, but when I tried to get off my ship, the planet wouldn't load, I tried restarting and all that jazz, nothing worked, finnaly I found online a cheatcode to warp straight to Dantooine so to use it, open the swkotor2.ini file as I said above and under the [Game Options] header insert a line and type: --- EnableCheats=1 --- Then Start StarWars:KOTOR2 and load your game, and press this button: --- `  --- the one with the ~ sign right above it, just above the tab key. --- Then type: --- warp 605dan --- -Then Press Enter- --- Don't worry about the fact you can't see your typing, the cheat console is invisible. And Tada! Your on Dantooine and Can finish your game! --- The only other advice I have for you is !Save Often! and !Don't OverWrite Your Saved Games! I found that saving your games as 1,2,3,4,etc., to be a quick way to do this. ---  --- May the Force be with You
The backpack is great.  It is a wonderful tool for dogs with lots of energy.  You can fill it with lots of weight and they love carrying it.  It secures well, and dogs love it.  If you give a dog a job, they really feel useful, and I think they appreciate it a lot
I bought this along with the "Some Kind of Gorgeous" foundation faker.  I don't have the best skin, (oily), but like a more natural look.  These two product together are so great.  I look natural, but healthier.  And my skin stays less shiny all day.  I use the other side of the foundation sponge to apply it
this is a classic gangster movie already, anyone whos into the whole block scene should add this to their collection
Well, almost. The seats were good and I drank straight out of the bottle. The DVD wasn't what I thought I had purchased but I'm not at all unhappy about getting it. Very, very, very good quality audio/video and I don't mind watching it often
I found this product did absolutely NOTHING for me...granted I don't have huge wrinkles, but the few I do have certainly got no better and i'm wondering if it made them worse! I wish I had asked around from friends, cause if I had I would have discovered this on my own without wasting the money. I'm wondering a couple of things, what all the fuss is about with strivectin? Is it just that everyone is different and some people have good results and some don't? AND is there anyone out there who can recommend a product that REALLY works? (if it works i don't mind spending the money...
I was thrilled to find this set here on Amazon, and buying this set is so much cheaper then buying each volume seperatly. All of the DVD's have some good interviews with the producers, designers, voice actors, and other people associated with the show.  I don't usually like watching interviews/things where people talk a lot, but I love watching those interviews over and over and seeing the steps they took to make this show as good as it was. I totall reccomend it to anyone looking for something a little different
i love nature and cowboy movies.  Jeremiah Johnson was on of the best movies i've seen.  it is unforgetable.  It was my favorite  RobertRedford movie.  He did very little talking talking in this movie, he just acted, his best performance ever.  the movie deals with the american indian also, in a profound and touching way.  this movie is engrossing and based on a true story,  it's simply the best. Don't miss the opportunity to see this movie, it is a classic.  It truly is in a league of it's own.  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  --- 
I couldn't even assemble the product, and there were no instructions on how to do so
The pieces of this toy (the outfits, etc.) all ripped when we pulled them off the starter sheet.  Also, the pieces are too little and get easily lost when played with and the outfits are uncolorful and depressing. In general, this toy is hokey and cheap.  I recommend Melissa and Doug's Magnetic Dress-Up and/or --- Magnetic Princess Dress-Up. All the pieces are wooden and are large enough to keep together.  Also, the outfits are colorful and beautiful and they come in nice wooden boxes with lids so that a child can keep things organized. 
I ordered the camera case for the Canon Digital Elph 450. And I was given a completely different one. Prices sound great, but they do not deliver what you buy. Had a bad experience with them.
The show is absolutely GREAT! Blue Falcon is another Space Ghost and Dynomut is the futuristic version of Scooby Doo. Dim witted and loveable. Getting the complete show is great and the shows from these HB vaults are all looking pretty good with bright and vivid colors (amid some nasty scratches and dust, but it WAS cheap animation folks). As a Scooby fan this is a MUST own! I quite enjoy the Blue Falcon/Dynomut show also.  ---  --- 5 stars for the show. ---  --- The set however nice still drops the ball, you get two single sided dvds and two flippers. The problem with this is that the dvds are all on top of each other with maybe a 1/16th of an inch between them both. I know this was to cut down on costs but it makes the two flipper discs quite hard to get out without scratching them or marking them up with a good fingerprint smear. But then again if it was a perfect world we couldn't complain. ---  --- All in all a solid set! ---  --- 4 1/2 out of 5
Even if this magazine is a mag-a-log, what would we do without it? September issue rocks with Eva Mendes on the cover and some juicy fall finds inside. The biggest news? Lucky has found a way to shop with your cell while stuck in traffic. It's about time technology got up with our lifestyle
This album is very weak compared to his earlier efforts.  The music is simple and straightforward, and the rapping is poor
The professionals in the law field in this book aren't the type of lawyer or law professional most people want to become.  I understand not everyone becomes a six-figure-paid lawyer right out of law school, but this book is ridiculous.  It shadows a guy who wants to only be a law clerk?  Give me a break
Don't buy Zone Alarm if you use AOL; they are not compatable.  The pop-ups will drive you crazy and AOL won't work properly.  Also plan on your computer running much slower when this software is installed.  I bought it from Amazon and had to throw it away in a month...  no refund; money lost.  Norton is far better with AOL
it's a nice pool..a pain in the ass to blow up without a pump but oh well. lol  it's a good tuy over all to have and holds a lot  of water. it's just hard to dump it all out once you're finished..that drain hole should be on the side and NOT on the bottom of the pool
Quickly became my favorite when it first came out.  Tastes great and the milk doesn't turn orange like some of the new granola type cereals.  I also use it on ice cream to add crunch.  I would give it 5 stars but even though it think it's great it is overpriced.  Price here is about the same as out local Safeway
There's nothing "universal" about this product.  It'll split lightweight stuff like cell phones, but don't trust anything more demanding than that with this splitter.  I hooked my laptop up through it and the fuse blew within one second.  Sadly, I'd bought four of these since shipping cost as much as the item itself, and ALL FOUR died when I tried them with my laptop.  The back of the package says not to use items that use over a total of 10amps, which seemed reasonable, so I got out my ammeter and figured out that my laptop used 6amps at most, so not only is this busted, but they lie on the package.  I managed to open up the splitter and put in some more heavy duty wiring and a stronger fuse, and then it worked for a short time until I started smelling plastic melting -- it turns out even one of the springs inside couldn't handle 6amps and heated up enough to disfigure and melt plastic around it.  I give this item two stars only because you might want to plug in two cell phones simultaneously.  For anything else, beware
I've bought a LOT from Amazon over the years. This was the first watch though. I've bought and owned several SEIKO watches. This is probably the WORST experience that I've ever had with Amazon and Seiko too! ---  --- The watch came with a box that looked water damaged. The watch itself has a broken clasp. It looks beautiful,but I bought it as a gift.  ---  --- When she opened it, the clasp refused to lock. Its never gone far enough to have the time set or even being tried on. Amazon actually tried to sleeze out of it by telling me to follow the waranty pocedures. How long does she have to wait for her Birthday gift? The warranty process could take weeks
I ended up getting a total of 6 of these units for all the trucks at my work. Overall they work fairly well. No problems jumping our work trucks. Chevy 1500 work trucks and a couple ford F150's. The light comes in handy. The air compressor does take a while to fill up a tire, and the hose is kinda short,but it does work. Other than that, it works great and has a built in battery tester which is nice to see. I have no problem getting multiple jumps in between charges. It recommends charging them once a month even if you don't use them. 4/5 Star
The synopsis ... --- Sam and Jonah Baldwin, father and son, have lost the most important woman in their lives to cancer.  Seeking to escape from the painful memories that lurk in every nook and cranny of Chicago, they move to Seattle.  Eighteen months later, Jonah can sense that his dad is still sad; and, in desperation calls a nationally syndicated radio self-help guru on Christmas Eve to wish for his father a new wife.  Annie Reed lives in Baltimore and is engaged to Walter.  Their relationship, while loving and comfortable, is entirely devoid of romantic sparks.  When Annie hears Jonah's soulful plea on the radio, it's as if her heart has been touched by "magic" and she is determined to find out why she feels so powerfully drawn to Sam and his son ... even if it means traveling across "like 26 states". ---  --- The critique ... --- Sleepless in Seattle is a brilliantly simple film; that's what makes it so great.  To quote Nora Ephron, "It isn't a movie about love, it's a movie about love in the movies."  To emphasize this point, she incorporates various parallel references to "An Affair to Remember" throughout the film; but, Sleepless is also a movie about our genuine romantic fantasies and sentimental ideals about falling in love (which, let's admit it, have been undeniably shaped by what we've seen on the silver screen).  The script is refreshingly candid, yet endearing and Nora Ephron's direction is impeccable.  Ross Malinger, cast as Jonah Baldwin, is the youngest and most notable talent in the film.  He does an excellent job of portraying THE quintessential eight-year-old; he's impulsive, moody and thinks he knows it all.  (I speak from experience here folks; I currently have a son that age.)  He and Tom Hanks come together flawlessly as father and son; so successfully in fact, that they would be utterly convincing off screen.  The chemistry between Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks is equally amazing, which is no small achievement considering the fact that they rarely appear together in a scene.  The supporting cast is brimming with talent and includes Rosie O'Donnell, Bill Pullman, Rita Wilson, Rob Reiner, David Hyde Pierce, and a young Gaby Hoffmann.  Families with younger children will appreciate the film's integrity; there is very little foul language ("God damn it" and " ... it scared the shit out of me ..." being the worst of it) and no "sexual content" to be wary of.  All around, this is a winning film.  One that I find myself watching over and over and over again. ---  --- The DVD ... --- For a 10th Anniversary Edition, the special features are few and rather disappointing.  You've got your basic director commentary, a music video ("When I Fall in Love" by Celine Dion & Clive Griffin), and a "Love in the Movies" Featurette.  This last piece is approximately 15 minutes long.  It features the director, producers, actors and the hosts of Loveline: Drew Pinsky and Adam Carolla (why they are included, I don't know) talking about "Love in the Movies."  There are some interesting interview segments with an Empire State Building Historian and some very beautiful shots of the New York skyline before 9/11; but there's certainly nothing here to write home about.  By far, the most exciting feature is that you can choose your aspect ratio.  (And honestly, how exciting is that?)  This a DVD that you buy for the film alone.

These placemats are perfect for a toddler who loves to dump food out and spread it out on the table, especially for when you're out in public places.  They stick onto anything and have fun things for kids to look at (my son is obsessed with anything Sesame Street - esp Elmo - so he loves staring at the placemat).  They're easy to fit into any purse, diaper bag, pocket so they're always accessible. 
This product costs 10 times more then a regular gel.  But it does not even work as well as a regular shaving gel.  Its like putting a thin layer of soap on you face.  It did not help at all. No doubt the people who marked this up one thousand present are the geniuses in the Marketing Department, because, it fooled me just like it fooled everyone; $$$18 FOR A GEL! IT MUST BE more effective, "I'll give it a try". There is a sucker born every day. ---  --- Jose' (sucker
I had two choices watching this movie...smile or laugh out loud. When I wasn't smiling I was laughing. Keaton's The General is a perfect introduction for those who may shy away from silent movies or who may think silent comics are too exaggerated and mannered. The story line is simple, but what Keaton does with it is genius.  ---  --- Johnny Gray (Buster Keaton) is an engineer for the Western and Atlantic Railroad. He has two loves, his engine, the General, and Annabelle Lee (Marion Mack), a fine Southern belle. When war starts, Johnny rushes to enlist but is rejected. He's more valuable to the South as a train engineer than he would be as a soldier. Trouble is, nobody tells him why he was rejected. Worse, Annabelle thinks he may be a coward, and tells him she doesn't want to see him again until he is in uniform. Just then northern spies secretly enter the town to steal the General and take it north, destroying bridges and lines along the way, while a Northern army moves south. Unknowingly, Annabelle Lee finds herself on the train and is kidnapped. Johnny sees the General chugging away and races after it, determined to bring back the General. When he realizes Annabelle Lee is held captive, his resolve knows to bounds. ---  --- For the rest of the movie we are on one of the cleverest, fastest, funniest chase movies ever filmed. Keaton creates slapstick situations and sight gags that not only are funny, but that always are in character and which always are part of the specific plot point. And when he rescues Annabelle and realizes how hopeless her Southern belle helplessness can be, his exasperation is matched only by his love. The General features a big cast, a major battle, fleeing armies, a failing dam and a spectacular moment when an engine tries to cross a burning bridge and everything collapses into a river gorge. ---  --- Keaton's timing and inventiveness are legendary; so is his risk-taking. He does all his own stunts and some of them were dangerous. In one, he is lying back on the engine's cow catcher while the train is moving at some speed forward. In the distance is a railroad tie across the tracks. Keaton has another railroad tie in his hands. At the last moment he tosses his tie so that the end hits the end of the other tie and they both bounce off the track just as Keaton on the cow catcher passes. This scene has no cutting. The two ties fly off as high as Keaton's head. He could have been killed; instead we laugh. It's amazing that in his older years Keaton could still walk. His body took incredible punishment for the laughs. Try falling hard backwards off a moving flatcar and landing on your back across railroad ties. His ingenuity is extraordinary. How do you build excitement out of an extended train chase? Both engines are behemoths and are on the same track. They can't pass each other. Keaton does it with endless bits of business. In fact, he does manage to reverse the chase at one point in an immensely clever moment combining logic and split-second timing. ---  --- What makes Keaton so funny and so contemporary is that he doesn't do double-takes. He barely reacts. But he's no stone-face. Keaton's characters are simply very serious fellows. Things happen to them. His characters don't react to events so much as they overcome them with honesty and good intentions. ---  --- This edition of The General comes from Kino Video and looks good. It includes two Keaton short films, The Playhouse (1921) and Cops (1922). In The Playhouse, Keaton portrays all the members of the cast, orchestra and audience in a stage show, including nine members of a minstrel act, the ladies in the audience and a trained chimp. In Cops, he finds himself in a police chase that is one amazing situation after another
I love the look and they are very comfortable on my feet. I got the black and white, and I love them with a pair of capris or long shorts
I picked up a bag of these at my local health food store a few months ago after hearing that Pirate's Booty was a great product. These tasted rather odd to me and I wound up getting rid of the bag as quickly as possible. Puffed corn and a chocolate type of taste just don't go well together in my opinion. It might have been ok if the cocoa was all you could taste, but that was not the case here
I had this this a couple years ago and it kept jamming on me
I WAS VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT!  I WAS GIVEN THE SHAMPOO FOR CHRISTMAS WHICH WHEN WASHING MY HAIR MADE LITTLE TO NO SUDS.  WHEN TRYING TO COMB OUT MY HAIR AFTER SHAMPOOING IT WAS LIKE A BEES NEST AND I COULDN'T POSSIBLY GET A COMB THRU IT.  THATS WHEN I ORDERED THE CONDITIONER WHICH WAS LIKE CAKE BATTER AND COULDN'T GET IT TO COME OUT OF THE CONTAINER WITH REALLY QUEEZING IT WHICH MADE THE LETTERING COME OFF ON TO YOUR HANDS AND I FOUND SOME IN MY HAIR. I SQUEEZE AND BANG UNTIL I FINALLY GET A BIG LUMP COMING OUT.  I HAD WATCHED ALL OF JONATHAN'S REALITY SHOWS WHEN HE WAS WORKING ON CREATING HIS PRODUCTS AND COULDN'T WAIT TO TRY THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL NATURAL. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED!  I RECENTLY SAW HIS SHOW BACK TV WHERE SOMEONE CALLS HIM UP AND SAYS THEY TRIED HIS PRODUCT AND HOW HAPPY THEY WERE AND JONATHAN GETS ALL CHOCKED UP.  I WAS SCREAMING AT THE TV I WAS SO UPSET.  THE PRODUCT WAS NOT CHEAP AND CAN'T BELIEVE I CAN'T USE SOMETHING I SPENT SO MUCH MONEY ON.

I loved the first Carole Matthews novel I read, "For Better or Worse", and picked this up in an airport hoping to be entertained once again. It kept me entertained while on a three and a half hour flight, but only because I didnt' have anything else to do. I am the type of person who has to finish a book once they start but it was really hard for me to even pick this one up again after getting off the plane.   ---  --- I totally disagree with the premise behind the whole thing and found it completely pointless. There were no redeeming qualities and few parts in the book even worth mentioning. To me, Matthews expects you to feel sorry for a woman whose married lover decided he needed to be with his wife and kids instead of leaving them for her. I think this is a horrible/unrealistic messgage.  ---  --- If you want to read something good, pick up a Jane Green novel instead. 
The filter is small compared with most other systems; has a sturdy, metal fixture and pull-knob activator; filters quickly with plenty pressure; and of course it has the great Culligan taste
This cd is so awesome, It stays in my cd player and I have recently added it to my MP3.
I love this shoe! It looks very elegant on the foot and there's a little bit toe cleavage which is always a plus! But make sure to go half a size up. It's a little snug in the front and it takes a couple wears to break it in.
I did a lot of research and if you follow directions , it is safe and fun. --- It takes about 25 min to heat the oil and 45 minutes to cook an 11 lb. turkey. The pot has a maximum oil level mark and that was the correct amount for our bird. The turkey must be dried well to prevent spattering. Watch the oil temp. so it does not go over 350. Do it outdoors as the paint has to burn off the burners and it smells.
There's really nothing more that can be said to further the reputation of this series of grills.  Those of us that own the Genesis E-310 series grill know how well this grill is manufactured, and just how very well it performs its duties.  It is, by far, the very best gas grill in this price range I have ever owned or used.  A couple of notes: --- -The cross-over ignition system works wonderfully (it takes less than 3 seconds to fire up all three burners --- -Those who say that their gas grill does not get hot enough to sear meats don't own this grill- I've had it up to 550 degrees on a very cold MN winter day --- -That said, it seems to go through a good amount of propane when running all 3 burners on high...but that is probably obvious considering the temps you can obtain when running it on full.  (It will be interesting to see if I can get 500 + degrees to sear meats on medium setting on a summer day....).  The fuel gauge inside the cabinet is also a handy feature --- -As always with this series of grills- No Flare ups, and the flavorizer bars do what Weber says they will, namely vaporize fats and juices into smoke that adds flavor to what you are grilling --- -To keep this review balanced, there is one negative- I dislike the tool holders.  Although there are plenty, your tools pretty much have to have one of those leather hanging loop things to keep the tools from falling off or even to use the holders (a small price to pay I guess) ---  --- Finally, the Genesis E-310 I purchased came in a copper color, something I haven't seen on Amazon, or on Weber's site for that matter.  Maybe I missed it, or maybe I got lucky.  Either way, it looks pretty darn sharp on our deck when it isn't covered
Love this product.  I like having these Microsoft programs without paying the price for the full versios
It's flimsy...breaks at the slightest touch...it's a PAIN to open and close!  My 15 month old figured out that all you have to do is shake the gate a little and it opens...I found this out when I was putting groceries away...I went to look for her and she was on the 2nd stair from the top!  I can't say enough bad things about this gate.  It's worthless.  If I could rate it MINUS stars I would
I purchased this Boombox over a year and a half ago.  What I do like about is that it was hard to find a boombox with a remote and Mp3 playback.  I agree that it could have been better.  It would be nice to be able to rewind from the first to the last.  You cannot rewind/fast forward in the song in Mp3 format but you can do it with a regular audio cd. sometimes I like to hear a certain portion of a song again, but I will have to play the entire song again. I no longer have the remote and there are some things that I cannot do anymore. 
A great great novel! Catches you from the beginning and doesn't let go. You become obsessed and engrossed. Collins has the most gorgeous way of writing....drawing you in. And his descriptive ability is astounding
I bought this headset for internet chats with my husband, when he travels for business. I find it comfortable to wear and easy to use.  The sound quality is good, volume more than adequate and my husband does not hear any echo. ---  --- I like the fact that it uses an AAA battery instead of a charger. All you need is a spare battery and no worries about the device dying when the internal battery dies. (Even rechargeables do not last forever.)  ---  --- The ear wrap is comfortable and stays securely on my ear. It would be nice if it bent for a custom fit, but I am pretty happy with it
don't buy this item...I was cheated...now i am gonna send it back. --- Its really waste of your money. --- don't go by the price...i will never buy anything from this site
I was really looking forward to reading "Ever After" when I saw the favorable quote on the back cover by  Larry Gelbart. But the book turned out to be a VERY cursory glance at the past 25 years of musical theater with remarkably little insight. Here are the three things I learned from this book: (1) Mega-musicals are almost always artistically corrupt; (2) Andrew Lloyd Webber is the anti-Christ; (3) The only innovative musicals to arrive in the past 25 years started Off-Broadway (mostly at Playwrights Horizons and Lincoln Center). Most of the hundreds of shows mentioned in this book get one paragraph each, with very few illuminating details. Here's what the author says about "Carrie," perhaps the most famous recent Broadway musical flop: "Carrie, of course, was an instant classic, a monument in the pantheon of failed Broadway musicals. Adapated by Michael Gore (music) and Don Pitchford (lyrics) from the notorious Stephen King novel (and even more notorious film), this $7 million musical celebration of prom vengeance and bad taste materialized at the Virginia Theater on the 12th of May, 1988 and was gone by the 15th, touching all who saw it with a timeless reverence for its indelible, monumental ineptitude." Does that really tell us very much about this musical? Did Barry Singer even see the show? You sure wouldn't know it from this description. And just what, I wonder, makes King's novel "notorious" or the movie "even more notorious"? Almost every show in this book rates that brief a mention, but somehow Singer finds time for an entire chapter of Lloyd Webber-bashing where Sir Andrew invites the author to a cocktail party to show off his newest female singing discovery. The chapter sticks out like a sore thumb, if only because it has nothing to do with the rest of the book, but also because it's one of the few times that Singer goes into any detail. Aside from a few interesting Sondheim quotes, this book is a waste of time.
This series has just a tad too much blood for my taste... it verges on horror, here and there, which bugs me; I even like super-violent action movies just fine, but the brutally slaughtered recent corpse thing (more 'personalized' violence than killing bad guys) is not my style. This is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. ---  --- Aside from that detail, I find this show totally addictive. The brothers make a 'buddy movie' effect, and the whole supernatural framework creates a sort of non-religious yet definitely spiritual effect (the big mystery being why these guys never ever are seen praying in the show; I have actually known people who had a lifestyle similar to what the show depicts, and that is central). ---  --- Not to mention the young men being so passionate, powerful, strong, yet sensitive, darkly troubled from the past, sheer SEXY it's nearly intoxicating over the long run of many episodes. ;-) ---  --- Anyway -- the show has an actual plot, it's well filmed and intelligently done and is well worth watching. I recommend it
Registry mechanic is a great registry tool.  It works better than the registry tools included with Symantec System Works.  If you purchase this version at 5.1 you can get a free upgrade to the latest version 6.0 once you register the product.  Try the evaluation and you will see how many registry errors your machine may have that can effect its performance
Right, just so everyone knows, I have never played this game, however, i think you should read this. --- I bought Fable, and found that my computers graphics card was not compatible with it. It is good enough but not supported, so to avoid this i suggest checking the support section of the website before you buy to check that your card is compatible. --- As they have actually put a list of cards on the site, i assume that this problem is not uncommon so i advise you to check this before buying the game. Just thought you should know
It is a nice watch for the Dollar spent on this item. The catch is that it will work with the concept of Wave-ceptor. And it adjusts time according to the place you are in. So...good watch..!
I enjoyed this game quite a bit--I ended up putting all of the other games I was playing aside to just finish this one.  You play as the three Baudelaire kids.  The story follows the 2004 Lemony Snicket film fairly closely, as you must first escape Count Olaf's decrepit mansion, then avoid being killed by a train before you head off to Uncle Monty's herpetology paradise, Aunt Josephine's seaside town, and finally save Violet Baudelaire from a fate worse than death.  The environments are attractive and fun to explore, and the game play and puzzles are neither too easy nor too challenging and frustrating. ---  --- For most of the game--as you explore environments, solve puzzles, search for secret rooms and such, you can switch between Violet and Klaus Baudelaire as you please.  For many "important" events, such as boss fights, you must play as one or the other, as they each have different skills and weapons.  For some sequences--those that are basically 2D platformer sections (the entire game has some platformer aspects, but it's usually loosely employed and 3D), you must play as Sunny, the baby Baudelaire (and this is the only time you can play as her). ---  --- The various puzzles and challenges--they almost amount to a series of "mini-games", are varied and mostly non-repetitive, helping retain your interest.  Some are fairly easy to figure out and perform, but some are appropriately more challenging, both mentally and in terms of manipulating the controller, and take many tries to complete.  A couple first-person shooter sequences (the game is mostly in a third person mode), are especially challenging, particularly the end, but that's the final boss fight, so that's to be expected.  Like most games, winning boss fights requires discerning patterns in the bosses and adapting a strategy appropriate to the pattern, which takes both brains and manual dexterity. ---  --- There are a couple negatives with the game, but they are minor.  Games like this, released in response to the success of a film, are often rushed through production.  That becomes evident here in the cut scenes, which are not very exciting--they feature 2D black and white sketches that are more like a slide show as major portions of the story are read to us.  But I'd rather have skimping done in cut scenes than in game play, and that's just what was done here.  Also, although the graphics are wonderful for the most part, the visuals are a bit dark overall--I found it best to play with the lights off.  With a bright overhead light on, the glare was too much to see important information in the game.  Finally, I would have preferred a different save game scheme, as you can only save when the game asks if you want to, and the save points seem almost random.  Sometimes you can save after accomplishing only one more minor task.  Sometimes you have to do long sequences (and sometimes a number of challenging ones) before you can save again. ---  --- The game isn't quite as funny as the film and doesn't have exactly the same "magical" atmosphere, but it is an engaging and fun journey to another world.  The soundtrack, by Jeremy and Julian Soule, and inspired by Thomas Newman's great soundtrack for the film, is also a major asset--I found myself wanting to explore levels again later on as much to hear the music again as anything else
...and I've tried quite a few.  I tried over 30 varieties of green tea bags searching for a good cup, and this one takes the crumpet!  The flavor is strong but mild, the color golden brown, and the aroma is light.  I threw out all the others (or rather I gave them to my father-in-law who also like tea) when I found this one and I bought a case of it..
Good black tea is not hard to find - just hard to find in your grocery store.   ---  --- The honest truth is that Tazo really does not make many, if any really good teas.  This, in particular, is one of their worst.  It is bitter and leaves a bad taste in your mouth immediately. ---  --- Every time i get stuck in a starbucks with friends i am faced with the choice - tea, chai or steamed milk.  Every time i cave in and give Tazo another chance it disappoints me.  If you want a good black tea look for a local tea shop and let them brew you a few cups.  Try a keemun, a lapsang and maybe golden dianhong and see how it goes.  If you really want to kick it up a notch look for a  --- Cameroonian black. ---  --- take it from someone who really loves tea, this stuff is not worth your time.  and when you get good tea, please don't brew it in your coffee maker
The shoes look and wear great.  However, the leather is pretty weak.  I think I must have kicked a table leg or something on my frist outing in them.  Now the tip of my left shoe has a quarter-size scuff on it.  I will have to try to cover it up by oiling it.  Obviously I don't think this pair will last long at all
I bought a 700 series iRiver to use at the gym, which came with this Armband, at first it was great, but it didn't last, there are two clasps which don't sta attcked well, and the pocket that holds the mp3 player itself is held together with a glue that comes undone after a few weeks of daily use
This book is poorly written and even more poorly edited. The back cover states ... "every subject is given background and basic exercises to allow beginners to figure it out." It is a great statement, but it is unfortunately not true. ---  --- Page 6: "So what formats can a script be saved as? There are three main kinds of script files: regular compiled script, which is the native AppleScript file format, and scripts saved as plain text or as applications. On top of that, OS X added a new option for saving compiled scripts and script applications called "bundle." Bundles are folders that appear and behave as files. You can read about them in Chapter 23." - I guess bundle is not a "main" format? Why is there a distinction between main formats and, for lack of a better term, minor formats? I have no idea.  ---  --- Page 35: "Every class has a super class." --- Page 40: "We saw that objects belong to classes, and classes may have subclasses and super classes." - Which sentence is correct? ---  --- Page 43: "When you work with an application that doesn't support the whose clause, you have to settle for slower, clumsier repeat loops." - Repeat loops are not explained earlier in the book. There is no reference on this page to the repeat loops that are explained extensively in Chapter 11, pages 321-343. ---  --- I wanted to like this book, but I do not. I look forward to a revised first edition or new second edition of this book, because it does have potential to be great. However the next edition needs more polished writing and meticulous editing
This is a great battery charger that you need if you have a boat and trolling motor.  High quality and easy to use
I just made this soup for the first time, and it could not have been easier.  Add water, heat, and then garnish with a little cheese.   ---  --- I didn't find it terribly spicy hot. The chiles used are nice and mild. ---  --- A tasty dinner indeed
I read the other reviews, some glowing, others well.. not so glowing.  The price was right, ($149 - 50 rebate) So I thought I would take a chance.  I read the other reviews so I have no one else to blame but myself. ---  ---   First off, I am only interested in playing videos from my computer, so I have no idea how well the image viewing or MP3 playing works.   ---  ---   I also notice other people reviewing this product had all kinds of problems with wireless connections.  My house is fully wired with CAT5, therefore I am using this product wired, not wireless. ---  ---   I was able to get the device connected to my network and reading files from the media server within 10 minutes of opening the carton... so far so good.   The first thing I did was check for updates.  An update was found and updated successfully. ---  ---   I then had the DSM-320 look for media servers.  It found the tversity server right away and I was able to see the contents listed.  This unfortunately is the end of the good news.  It's all went downhill from here. ---  ---   1.  Neither server, tversity or the Dlink were smart enough to view a folder of VOB files as a movie.  They listed them as VOB_1, VOB2 etc.  So for example, I clicked on my Casablanca folder, I would then need to click on VOB_1 to start the movie.  When VOB_1 ended after about 20 minutes, it did not go to VOB_2.   I needed to use the remote and manually select the next item to play.   arrrgghh!!  P.O.S. thing. ---  ---   2.  As another review stated, the FF simply does not work properly.  Oh, sure if you press FF the movie will fast forward.  But there is no way to stop it.  If you press play while the movie is FF'wding, the movie starts to play from the beginning of the current VOB.  more, arrrrgghh! --- This alone is enough of a nuisance to return the device.  Which I will be doing first thing in the morning. ---  --- My final advice to any prospective buyers:  S T A Y   A W A Y !!!! ---  --- My final advic to D-Link, Great idea, but your product absolutely sucks. ---  --- Oh one more thing,  Someone mentioned that their tech support was very freindly.  Yes the two ladies I spoke to were both very friendly, their English was terrible.  (Guess which county you call for tech support... oh come on, just one guess)  It also sounded like each of the tech support personnel are sitting shoulder to shoulder to one another.  I could hear at least 2 other tech support people communicating with their clients.  Which made it very difficult for the lady helping me.  She needed to ask me to repeat myself over and over.  Sheesh,  I must have read my phone number to her at least 4 times before she got it right. ---  --- One last interesting tidbit, on the packaging, they mention Nero recode CE.  So I went to the nero site to check it out.  Nero has a list of Supported Media Players listed.  And you know what, D-Link is NOT one of them.  I will return this D-Link junk and purchase one the Nero certified product instead. ---  --- I bow my head in shame, As I had read the reviews but I bought the product anyway.
This is a good medium priced shaver.  It does a good job, is fast, and easy to clean.  It is attractive, and fits the hand well. Not top of the line, but a good value.  Nothing negative to report.
... which makes the wrench completely useless.  I'll have to buy another wrench elsewhere from a vendor that supplies the bits.  Also, the wooden handles have splinters and are extremely cheaply made.  Do not buy this product
This is very soothing for people with arthritis or any kind of injury and makes your hand feel wonderful
Like any parent, I was concerned about SIDS so the SleepSack seemed like the perfect alternative to blankets.  Little did I know, I would come to LOVE the SleepSack for it's warming capabilities. After a few months under their belt, babies get VERY squirmy in the middle of the night, so blankets are useless (and dangerous).  So I relied heavily on the SleepSacks to keep my little guy warm, even after the risk of SIDS passed. They come in fleece for winter months and cotton for warmer months, and they're generous in size, so they are not outgrown easily. I only wish I'd purchased them in yellow or white, in case my next baby is the opposite sex
I lost my HP R607 while on vacation and needed to replace it quickly. I couldn't fine another R607 (which I really liked), so I purchased the HP M407. I thought it would be the next best thing to my misplaced camera...NOT!! I don't like anything about this camera...It's terrible!  You can take about 4 pictures with regular batteries, about 10 with rechargeable ones (even with screen off). It says "auto focus", but I don't think it has any focus at all....not far away, not close up, nothing! It takes a really looooooooong time to actually Take the picture after you press the button.  I really hate it!  Keep Looking...Don't buy this camera
This movie is not worth Sam Elliot.  I was very dissapointed, I will most likely thow it away
This is a preety good game but after a while, it is very boring. i enjoyed it for about 2 months but now i am not intrested in it
I HAVE BOUGHT SEVERAL OF THEIR BRACELETS,BUT THIS ONE HAS A SPECIAL QUALITY TO IT,IT LOOKS SO EXPENSIVE,AND IS SO PRETTY,MATCHES EVERYTHING,WHAT CAN I SAY,I GUESSS THE LORD WAS GOOD TO ME,FINDING THIS AT A PRICE I CAN AFFORD,THE FIRST TIME I WORE IT,I GOT A COMPLIMENT,EVERYONE WANTS TO KNOW WHERE I GOT IT,I LOVE THIS BRACELET
My husband is using the Rosetta Stone Spanish program and loves it
I love me some Mamet.  His dialogue takes some getting used to, since it is crafted so as to touch on the edges of realism while inhabiting a more stylistic realm.  I also love his dedication to his actors, employing the same ones over and over, so that his movies come off as different shows performed by the same theatrical troupe, which may very well be his point. ---  --- However, Edmond is the first Mamet film to leave me disappointed and, worse, annoyed. ---  --- Macy plays Edmond with typical wide-eyed aplomb.  Edmond is a man who is weak, but is valiantly (if not clumsily) trying to be strong.  The movie starts with a chance encounter with a fortune teller whose tarot card reading provides a cinematic outline for the remainder of the film.  Edmond then goes home, breaks up with his wife, and goes on a deaf, dumb, and blind search for himself, finding instead over-priced whores, pimps who are not-what-they-seem, and -- generally -- everything but himself. ---  --- I get the point: Edmond is the epitome of modern man's emasculation, unable to find his own balls with both hands, and his tawdry and panicked search through New York for some unnameable salvation is an example of the lengths anyone must go (man or woman) to find, if not redemption, then the places where one "belongs." ---  --- There are a lot of problems here.  Most superficially, there's one of packaging.  The DVD box prominently features a picture of a gun, and no gun appears in the film.  The tags on the box call the film, alternately, a mystery and a fast-paced thriller, when it is neither one of those things.  Not even close.  This movie is (like most of Mamet's work) based on a play; never before has it been more obvious (unless you count the absolutely brilliant Oleanna).   ---  --- Edmond is, essentially, a one-man show, with Macy delivering numbing and rambling monologues, stopped only occasionally to engage in awkward and almost meaningless side action with ancillary characters (some of them played well -- Denise Richards actually shines in her brief scene as a hooker -- and some of them not so well -- Julia Stiles seems over-medicated in her role as an ambivalent and easily persuaded waitress).  In spite of how they do and don't help Edmond make his way through the tunnel of decadence and misery he creates for himself, most of these characters seem disposable, making the movie come across as equally dismissable.  (I would also like to take a moment here to make a small observation about Rebecca Pidgeon, Mamet's wife, an actress who appears, I think, in every single one of her husband's films: this woman is, viewed in even the nicest of lights, one of the worst actresses I've ever seen, and she sucks the life out of every scene she's in.  In this movie she plays Edmond's wife, and does so with heartless and uninspired vehemence.  It's nice that Mamet gives his wife the opportunities he does, but one has to wonder if she'd ever get any acting work at all if she weren't married to such a famous writer/director). ---  --- At the risk of spoiling the film, I will say that, at the end, Edmond finally does find where he "belongs," a place that, given his previous struggles, makes a lot of sense (although the manner in which he finds this belonging might offend more than a few viewers).  But this is small consolation since, by this time, few people are likely to have any sympathy for Edmond or where he ends up.  His character's slap-dash personality combined with the persistent and mostly meaningless monologues on fate, fear, destiny and (ironically) meaning make for a benumbing and distasteful cinematic experience.  A few good performances and some nice, visceral cinematography do not save this film from its plot and the dialogue that fails to move that plot along.  Avoid this flick; try Oleanna or Glen Gary Glenross instead. ---  --- 
I purchased this rail today for my daughter's crib that "converts" into a toddler bed.  Everything on the outside of the box looked great, until we got home, put it together and put it on the crib.  There is only about 6 inches of space for my daughter to climb in and out of bed.  Also it sits in about 3 inches which significantly reduces the amount of sleep space.  After playing with it for awhile, I decided to look over the instructions again.  It states in the warning section that this rail is only for a bed with a box spring and mattress and is not intended for a crib or toddler bed.  My question is "WHY DIDN'T IT SAY THIS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BOX?!" 
Apart from the emotional content due to the fact that a grandson defends his grandfather who is going to be executed for a racist crime, the films deals with the death penalty with great sympathy and ethical enlightenment. It also reveals with some silent moments here and there that the decision to execute the murderer is not at all taken for real moral reasons but only for political reasons. The governor finally gives the go-ahead message and refuses to pardon the murderer or even to stay the execution for some new investigation in some facts that appeared at the very last minute, and this under pressure from a crowd and he even announces his decision in front of this crowd and TV cameras. This is what is particular unbeareable about the death penalty : the final decision is always taken by some elected politician who turns it into his own political campaign  Just for that reason it is unethical. The film also reveals how the grandfather is transformed in just 28 days by the energy and dedication  of his grandson. He finally realizes, as he says so well, that he was not completely black and evil and that there must have been something good in him that he transmitted to his son who transmitted it in his turn to his grandson. There was a new hope in that man. But that was too late and that could not be taken into account by the governor. ---  --- Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Universit Paris Dauphine, Universit Paris I Panthon Sorbonne
OK, I'm a SciFi fan.  I read the SciFi reviews and thought this was really a movie for me, and it really was good right up to the end.  Just one problem, they forgot to write the end.  What happened?  Did they run out of money?  Did the writer write himself into a corner?  There was no climax, conclusion, or resolution.  You can argue till you are blue in the face about "pan & scan."  I prefer movies with an ending.  If you are looking for a great unfinished story, this one is for you
Although I often disagree with the 'New Yorker' politically and find the writing of Seymour Hersh offensive I believe that the 'New Yorker' publishes exceptionally fine pieces of non- fiction. I stress the non- fiction because this is what interests me in 'the New Yorker now'.Once it was the fiction of Salinger, Singer, of S.J. Perelman. But in recent years it has been the writing of Malcolm Gladwell, Adam Gopin and a number of others.  --- This is without speaking of the special feeling of class the New Yorker gives, its still topnotch cartoons, the 'On the Town' feature, and the first-rate 'Talk of the Town ' calendar
I owned this lens for about a year before upgrading to the image stabilized f/2.8 version.  Overall I was very happy with the f/4 lens and miss having it available because of the significantly lower weight.  Sharpness is amazing and comparable for both lenses, and the f/4 can provide plenty of background blur.  If you are shooting mostly outdoors I would recommend the f/4. 
As soon as I walked out of the theater I declared that I had to own a copy of this movie.  I had to wait a long time for it to be released to DVD (it was in theaters in late winter but they didn't put it to DVD till almost a year later...probably hoping to capitalize on awards' season reviews and recommendations).  It was well worth the wait.   ---  --- It is a shame that this film was overlooked with the awards.  I think that the timing of the release factored in but maybe it just appeals to some people (like me) more than others.  The entire ensemble does a great job. ---  --- I just rewatched it and I still enjoy it after at least 6 viewings.  It would make a wonderful addition to your video collection, especially if you are a Michael Douglas fan.  (And having a Pittsburgh connection helps too...the movie really captured a lot of the essence of Pittsburgh even with the weather when there is snow on the ground, the sun is peeking through and it is raining all at the same time!).  It is just a good movie all around and should appeal to viewers who enjoy smart films. ---  --- There are just truly funny scenes and some really touching parts.  What a wild journey these characters find themselves on over the span of just one weekend.  I think the best part is that it isn't non stop action and things don't get so out of the realm of possibility.  It still retains a good touch of believability, even as some pretty unbelievable things happen. ---  --- Pick up the soundtrack while you are at it.  Bob Dylan's "Things Have Changed" is great (and it recieved an Oscar).  It is mostly a CD to just kick back and relax to. 
In general I've been happy with Belkin accessories, but this cable is the pits. It lasted less than a month! I used it to connect my HD/DVR cable box to my receiver. No crimps, kinks, or undue stress on it, but within 30 days my audio went from spotty to noticeable gaps to nonexistent. ---  --- I don't like to support the Monster Cable hype, but because of their lifetime warranty I bought their cable to replace this one. So far no problems
Like so many Hollywood movies -- especially anything made after the late 60s, when America's teen-agers and collegiate students started taking their typically youthful antiestablishmentarianism with them into the future -- this is another passionate rage against the allegedly oppressive machine.  See The Shawshank Redemption, see Dead Poet's Society, see With Honors -- filmdom's lock-step march against authority is a mainstay of the past three or four decades.  Naturally, this movie is revered as something of a paragon if not a modern pioneer of the trend.  In regular Hollywood fashion, Nurse Ratched (the chief antagonist) and the cuckoos' restrictive environment are portrayed with just enough ambiguity to deflect charges that the movie is a paranoid feast for leftist sensibilities -- which it is, of course.  Unlike most fare of this sort, it is at least very competently crafted (the director and the actors sympathize with the source material enough to give it their all), which no doubt explains how it won one or two more of those little golden trophies than it would have gotten otherwise.  -- M. Cooper
Plot Summary: A man-without-a-memory found floating in the Mediterranean Sea searches for his identity, discovering along the way pieces to the puzzle that ultimately paint him as a highly-trained government assassin. ---  --- Reason for the Rating: Violence and some language. ---  --- Based on the Robert Ludlum-authored book by the same name, THE BOURNE IDENTITY is part action flick, part stylized thriller. In his first role as an erstwhile action hero, Matt Damon shines as Bourne, imbuing the character with both an appropriate edginess and a comfortable-in-his-own-skin-even-though-he-doesn't-know-who-he-is ease. --- As the story opens, Bourne is pulled out of the Mediterranean Sea and treated for suspicious bullet wounds by the crew of an Italian fishing boat. The "hey, this is a story about espionage" theme is introduced early as a crew member removes a tiny implant from Bourne that displays what we later learn is a Swiss bank account number. Upon finding and opening the safe deposit box, Bourne discovers multiple passports (including one with the name Jason Bourne), a variety of foreign currency, and a gun. He then begins his search to uncover his true identity--and until now, so does the audience. --- If there is one misstep in THE BOURNE IDENTITY, it may be the fact that early scenes involving the CIA and the agency's frantic attempts to track him down give audience members the answer to Bourne's identity far earlier than Bourne himself. At this point the film becomes more of a "how will he survive?" thriller rather than a "who am I?" mystery. --- A love interest of sorts (played nicely by Run Lola Run actress Franka Potente) gives Bourne a "partner in crime" to play off of for much of the movie, but her role seems more of a plot contrivance rather than a reasonable or logical plot development. An implied (off-screen) love scene for the two is just as implausible as it is brief, but doesn't detract too much from the action. --- The most interesting (and morally significant) moment in the film comes when Bourne finally remembers who he is as well as the mission he was on. Through this pivotal flashback (and some foreshadowing that finally makes sense), we learn that the highly-trained killing machine isn't capable of pulling the trigger upon seeing his assassination target's children in the room with him. Bourne's hesitation nearly costs him his life and sets the course for the film's premise as he is shot, falling into the Mediterranean Sea. --- Smartly directed, THE BOURNE IDENTITY is fast-paced without feeling rushed. The Cinematographer paints the European setting in shades of grays and yellows, giving the movie a unique noir-like look that fits well with the drama. As an action film decorated with whodunit sensibilities, this film is a winner for older teens and adults. ---  --- Nappaland.com Recommends: Ignore the plot contrivances and just enjoy the ride--THE BOURNE IDENTITY is a worthy discovery. ---  --- After the Show...If members of your family choose to view this movie, use these questions to spark discussion about it afterward: --- ---What do you think prompted Jason Bourne to pause when he was preparing to shoot his assassination target on the yacht? What does this say about Bourne's moral compass? --- ---How would you feel if you suddenly couldn't remember who you were? What actions would you take to discover your identity? --- ---When faced with the horror of who he really is and what he has done, Jason Bourne longs for a chance to erase his past and start his life anew. When have you felt that way? How can a relationship with Jesus give us a "second chance" in the truest sense? ---  --- S
Ignore the big word "Karaoke" on the cover and the microphone shown, this is just a music CD, it does not display anything in a karaoke player
This magazine does a great job of featuring good articles at the beginning and then breaking down events you might want to do in New York City that week. The magazine is organized into various categories that are color coded so that when you get it, you can just skip to the section you're interested in. There's a whole city out there to discover and TONY can help point you in the right direction
I like it,but I don't like box's watch which obsolescence.I hope my boy friend will love it
This perfume deserves negative stars. I was in Macy's when I saw this fragrance on the Dior counter. The bottle is gorgeous, and I really like Hypnotic Poison and Miss Dior Cherie, so I figured I would give this one a try. I really should have smelled directly from the bottle before spraying it on my skin. It is HORRIBLE. White floral scents are generally not my thing, but I can usually tolerate them. This was the worst perfume I ever smelled. It's way too powdery and it smells so cheap. I was stuck with it on my wrist all day and it kept making me sneeze. Disgusting. Not worth the money at all. If you want to buy this scent, I would recommend buying Dove Deodorant Spray instead. It's much cheaper and smells exactly the same. I wonder if it really is the Dove Deodorant but repackaged...hmm..
I'm the consumer of SanDisk USB flash drives. I have used couple of sandisk flash drives (i.e. 512MB Mini, 256MB Mini) before I bought this product.  ---  --- Performance wise this particular product is not doing good. It's taking long time to copy files from my computers. Even it's taking long time to delete files from this disk. So I returned to Amazon and looking for Mini products from SanDisk. ---  --- I doubt all the Micro products which is having capacity more than 512MB. Now I'm planning to buy 512MB or 1GB SanDisk Mini USB flash drive.   ---  --- Better buy some good one than wasting your time on this product
I have about two to three years of Knit N Style (2001 - 2003)Magazines, and lately have spent a lot of time looking through them for a Cardigan Pattern to Knit for myself.  I haven't found a single one.  All of the patterns have serious faults: Drop Shoulders, (totally unacceptable) little or no armhole, neck and/or shoulder shaping. Most sleeves have little or no cap. And, worst of all, they are all made in five or more pieces. Haven't any of these "designers" heard of Elizabeth Zimmerman?  I was going to give the lot to the library, but am wondering if perhaps the trash might be a better place.  If you are trying to attract new knitters from among younger people, why don't you teach them the PROPER way to knit?  Young people are smarter than you think
There aren't many games now-a-days that can get me interested enough to play regularly, but Dominions 2 is one that definitely does. ---  --- It's a multiplayer, multi-platform (Mac, Windows, Linux), turn-based strategy game. There is a tun of different strategies to go with, many nations, magic items, spells, different units. Excellent game for a hardcore strategy person. ---  --- The only drawback is the interface. It's certainly not perfect and takes a bit to get used to. But there is lots of documentation online to help with that kind of stuff. ---  --- I'd highly recommend this game to anyone who likes a good multiplayer turn-based strategy. It's the best I've ever played (and I've played quite a few
I had not idea that you could order that magazine directly from them until I bought one from our local Super Market. I was surprised at the difference that I had already paid to order from Amazon and what it was there.  I canceled my order and ordered from them.  --- Some items are much less on Amazon and some are much more. You just have to be careful.  --- A magazine is a magazine no matter where it comes from.
We purchased this gate for use with our youngest of four daughters.  The pressure gates we already had were difficult for our 3 and 5 year olds to get pass and it gets difficult constantly lifting them over the gate.  This gate is well worth the money.  The remote unit is on the wall in a place where everyone can reach it, except for the 13 month old of course.  It is so much easier for everyone.   ---  --- With all of the use our gate gets, the spot welds broke one day.  You really miss this gate when you have to go back to using a pressure gate again.  I called customer support, concerned because I do longer had my receipt or even the box.  The spot welds breaking loose was a problem they hadn't had reported before (so this apparently isn't a common problem!)  I was told we would receive a new gate within two weeks and the old one would be inspected by engineers to determine what had occured.  I was very impressed!  I will be sure to check out Evenflo products first when purchasing any new child/baby products for their customer support alone.  Service like that is not so common anymore.  Like I said, great concept and service
I bought these earrings as a gift for my sister and the first time she wore them the post fell off. I felt like the biggest loser. When I contacted Amazon, they said that because it was over 2 months that I had bought the earrings I couldn't return them. What a rip off. These earrings don't even deserve 1 star
I am highly sceptical myself when it comes to skincare products.  I received this as a gift after trying the mask of magnaminty (also good).  I was blown away by how this product made my skin feel.  I have used every product under the sun and am a regular proactiv customer.  This scrub was great for my oily skin and left it feeling really clean and soft.  I am totally hooked!  You will love it too...totally worth the money
Excellent program.  I love the improvement in Outloo
i'm new to the world of smoking, and ordered this for when i dont feel like doing the whole charcoal thing.  it works fairly well and the flavor is great, but not quite as much as you get from using a charcoal grill.  i think it was designed to be placed on either side of the grill...i've opted to slide the grates to the sides and place the smoker in the middle...it seems that less smoke escapes the grill this way.  a worthwhile purchase
I have only played this game for what 20 minutes and in the first 5 fell in love w/the game.I liked the stage where you can get on to the Great Wall of China(I think thats what it is).And my dad played this and for 4 minutes and gave the wii a 8/10!He said it could go up if he played more.The controls are so easy and fun!!!I highly recommend this to any wii gamer or person who is getting a wii
I love this perfume because it really lifts my mood.  I always thought of it as a little more citrus-y, but it's just a very fun perfume.  It's also nice because it's fun and flirty but still mature in a young professional type of way--if that makes any sense.  Ultimately, it's a great perfume, and I wear it almost daily
These diapers are the most awfulest things I think I ever bought for my baby. I received a lot of the "swaddler" size for my baby shower and I tried to use them for about 3 weeks before my pediatrician pinpointed it as the source of the relentless diaper rash my son had pretty much from birth. Stopped using them and lo and behold, diaper rash gone. Fast forward 3 months later when my son was hospitalized for a week and these were the only diapers the hospital supplied. Figuring that my son was older, maybe they wouldn't do as much harm. Wrong. The rash came back with a vengeance. I had to get diapers from home for the rest of the stay. I think it's because they are lightly scented with green dye inside. Definitely stay away if your child has sensitive skin
I used to buy this off the shelf each month, but last November, my wife bought me a subscription.   I bought the December issue,...cause it hadn't arrived by mail yet. No problem.  In January, I received the November issue.   A few weeks later, in early February, I received the December issue, but not the January, so I went out and bought the January.   By the end of February, still hadn't received the Feb yet, so bought it.  Then, received the January issue and a few weeks later the February.   I was fed up.   I know they were getting 'caught up', but not only was I getting editions that I'd already bought off the shelf, but I figured these were counting against my 12 issues.     I cancelled.  They deducted a few bucks from my refund for "issues received" and had no apologies for the mess. ---  --- I like the magazine, but I will say that if you read it over time, it become redundant.   The suggested work-outs are mostly rehashes of past work-out routines.  Lets face it...there are only so many ways to work out and when you get right down to it, you gotta hit it hard and often, change things up, etc...bla bla bla...   The BEST part of the magazine are the few pages they dedicate to the correct way to execute a lift or detail what muscles are hit.   Lots of Weider ads...but then its a Weider publication, so what can you expect... ---  --- I'd buy it off the shelf because you'll eventually get tired of the same old thing...and their subscription program is iffy. ---  --- -
My daughter had to stay in the hospital for 3 weeks.  She got very used to being swaddled, but after 4 kids I still can not do it right. This blanket makes her so comfortable she sleeps 5 to 6 hours at night at 3 weeks old. When both the blankets were in the wash she wouldn't sleep that long. She was up about every 90 minutes just wanting to be held. Thank god for this blanket it lets me get some sleep
This camera is incredibly frustrating.  I must admit that under ideal lighting conditions outdoors on a moderate to fully sunny day, the camera takes wonderful pictures.  However, photos using indooor and mixed lighting conditions leave alot to be desired.  If you want to take any indoor pictures with natural light, this is not the camera for you.  The reason being is that if the flash is not activated or the lighting is not perfect, the camera slows down the shutter speed considerably.  Since the camera does not have very good image stabilization (if any) indoor pictures are blurry unless you have the hands of a surgeon.  Of course you can use the flash, but then your subject will be overlit, while the background is pitch dark.  And forget about taking long range pictures indoors (i.e. at a graduation ceremony or wedding) because if the flash is on, you will get a black picture because the camera does not compensate the shutter speed for distance, it only adjusts to whether or not it thinks the flash is on.  If it is off, your picture will be blurred because the shutter stays open for 1-2 seconds.  Since I take alot of indoor pictures, this camera is worthless to me.  If you only plan to take outdoor pictures in ideal light, this is the camera for you.  If you want to do any natural light photography, forget it. 
 I bought a sight from Airsplat for my son's airoft rifle as a Christmas gift. The screws were too short to attach it to his Kitty Kat ( a shortened M-4) airsoft rifle's weaver rail. Yes, I could go out and find screws the proper length, but I though I'd make Airsplat do their job.  ---  --- So, after several e-mails with the service department, they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size. Wrong. The diameter of the new screws is so big they won't fit through the mounting bracket on the sight. Obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws.  ---   --- Why by a gun from these guys? If it arrives broken, you pay to ship it back. Want a refund? You pay a 15% restocking fee. Take a pass on Airsplat. 
I am an honest seller and I insure 100% satisfaction to my customers.  I can also ship out a better quality beanie visor hat for you.  ---   --- Please withdraw the feedback: -JTF Trading ---  --- Don't bother. I bought a better product from OldGlory. The feedback stays. People should know what they are buying. -Me ---  --- "Not a problem.  1 feedback doesn't hurt us at all because all of our other customers know about our products and our excellent customer service." -JTF Trading ---  --- Well, I guess all I can do is you "other customers" know what a POS this hat was. That, and I had the hassle of this guy emailing me after I thought I made it clear that the matter was closed.  ---  --- Try OldGlory for a better deal and a better product
I have subscribed for years to this - in my opinion, the hand's-down best, most balanced and useful periodical on dog care and behavior available.  Practical, solidly researched, non-preachy and impeccably edited, it provides even-handed coverage of almost everything that contributes to a dog's happiness, well-being and ability to be a good companion.  The annual dog-food ratings alone are worth the subscription price.  Every constituency should be as well-served by a publication as dog lovers are by this one
I highly recommend this bundle for the price.  For less than the cost of an offical Verizon travel charger, you get a travel charger, home charger and a USB cable with driver CD.  Everything works just fine.  The instructions for the USB cable are very lacking, so here are my suggestions:  you can use Windows Media Player to move music over to your phone using the Sync feature, and you can use a free program such as BitPim to do other file transfers between your PC and phone. 
It's my first semester teaching a general-student Jazz History course, and I wanted something beyond the textbook to get the students involved.  I bought this video as a "best-of-all-options" choice, and was  bowled over by it's thoroughness and attention to detail.  Everything we'd  discussed about Armstrong during class was there on the tape, reinforcing  my lectures and giving the kids a nice opportunity to both hear AND see the  legendary Louis.  For pure entertainment alone it was worthwhile, but for  instructional purposes I'd consider it a necessity for any future jazz  classes I'd teach.  I paid $16 bucks for it, but having seen it I think  I'd've paid fifty!  (Shh!  Don't tell Amazon!
My 3 year old son received this as a Christmas gift last year and he loves it.  He explores outside and collects things from the yard and hauls them around in the truck.  Must say the truck is durable, it stays out on the deck and the weather doesn't effect it.  We hose it down to clean it, no issues there.  Highly recommend
We bought this for our 3 year old daughter for Christmas.  We turned it on right away and she was very excited until the sound suddenly started to fade out.  We thought it was just a case of dead batteries, so we replaced the batteries - several times - until we realized the product was just bad.  When trying to get it replaced, we were told they were out of stock and our money would be refunded instead.  Needless to say, our daughter was very sad and we will not be buying this product anywhere, ever.  We'll just stick with another type of keyboard to help our daughter develop a love of music
This is a classic style work boot which used to be a lot more common than now, even appearing in one episode of "Leave It To Beaver" in the late '50s, and on the cover of one of Simon and Garfunkles albums of the late '60s. I've owned several pair of similar boots by other makers, including Red Wing. Some comments which apply to this style in general, (and not just Wolverines): Pros - The wedge sole absorbs a lot of shock making them great for standing/working on concrete, or walking long distances on hard surfaces. Also, the non-agressive tread means that dirt and grass doesn't track into the house after doing chores outside. The moc toe tends to breath through the seams, so feet tend to stay cooler and drier in hot, dry conditions. A great boot for the desert, and apparantly highly esteemed by many construction workers.  --- Cons - The wedge sole doesn't offer much traction for serious hiking on steep, loose surfaces (which I've used them for, but for which they really weren't intended). Gravel will roll right out from under them. None of the several brands I have owned were water-resistant at all. Walking through wet grass will lead to wet socks very quickly, as the seams around the toe which allow air and perspiration to escape also allow outside moisture to enter just as easily. We used to say "Your feet get wet two days BEFORE it rains". So, perhaps not the best choice for hiking in the Pacific Northwest. --- Specifically, the Wolverines were extemely comfortable right out of the box. They have a better insole than any of my previous boots of this style, a removeable polyurethane contoured cushion which provides good arch support. The color was actually more of a brown clay, rather than what I would call tan. The quality of workmanship appeared to be pretty good, actually better looking stitching than my Red Wings. However I was disappointed in the variable nature of the leather. The leather in most of the boot appeared to be adequately thick, however the leather used in the shaft around the ankles was thinner than I have ever seen in any work boot, thinner even than in many suede sneakers. While my ankles were covered, they didn't feel at all supported or protected. --- After considering for a couple of days, I decided to return the boots to the merchant who provided them for Amazon, The Sportsmans Guide. They had provided a return shipping label in the box, so I taped the box closed, applied the label, and took it to the Post Office. I received an email a few days later acknowledging their receipt of the package, and a notice of a credit applied to my account. --- So, while I'm not very excited about the particular pair of boots which I received, I do give good marks to Sportsmans Guide for a quick and relatively painless return.  ---  I ended up purchasing the Georgia SPR 6" Farm and Ranch boot, with wedge sole, also available through Amazon.

I was surprised by some unexpected guests for dinner.  I had not opened the jar before, so I wasn't sure how to use it.  I decided to pour it over boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cover the dish with tin foil and bake.  It was a hit!!  Even my husband liked it, and he is very picky and stuck on old favorites.  I just bought a couple more jars. --- 
The steamer works very, very well. Sure beats paying for, or even just the hassle of taking your stuff to the jeweler and wondering if you got back what you took in. Great gadget
My son is a college student in Boston and excitedly brought this board game home on one of his breaks. "You've GOT to play this game!" he said. It had been years since anyone could even so much as coax me over to a table where a board game was being played. But I wanted to spend time with my son so I consented to learn it. Turns out, it was amazing! My husband, 13-year-old son, the bringer-of-this-new-addiction and myself must have played it 20 times in the 3 weeks he was home. The "board" is different every time you play it so nothing is predictable, rolls of the die dictate one's success, trading and strategies can get intense and the more you play it, the more you definitely like it. Alas! I've "settled" into Catan mode and no longer need to beg him to bring it home from school.  I bought my own house copy plus the expansion so we can get visitors hooked on it, too. We play it all the time. Cross my heart, this is fun. As my son said, "You've GOT to play this game!"  
Metallica never recovered from the death of Cliff Burton, as this album is prime evidence of.  He helped to bring depth to the songs that is not present here.  Also, Newstead only gets one song on this album, which is ironically the best song on the album.  In the history of Metallica, this album marks the transition from artistic song writing to commercial
I begged to see this movie in 1985! I was only 14 but I knew I had to see it and buy the soundtrack. (remember cassettes?)  Never has Rob Lowe or Emilio Estevez looked better! Hot, Hot, Hot!!  No this isn't Oscar worthy or anything, but if you are a die-hard 80's Brat packer, this is the one!  
I bought this for my 5  year old daughter and we tried to take very good care of it.  Within a few days of careful use, one of the latches bent, a hinge broke off and a piece of the edge came unglued.  It is a great idea, but needs better construction.  On a positive note, my daughter loved it and would have spent hours drawing and creating with the tools inside if I let her.  However, I had to take the box away so further damage does not occur before I can fix it.  The drawers work fine.  The problem is with the two doors on top that flip out.  Note about drawers; Little plastic door knobs pop out.  Need to be glued in. 
Garbage metal - music for the American mainstream to feed on.  I saw them open for Slayer about 4-5 years back, and they had about 5 guys on stage doing nothing except JUMPING UP AND DOWN.  How pathetic !  ---  --- Pick up some real metal.... like old Kreator. 
I was hoping that Miller would turn his talents from the dark side and we would see how well he could reproduce a Classical Epic.  What we get is a blood splattered "300 Lacedaimons in the Hood".  The Spartans are presented to be a buch of Homo erotic Rastafarians.  The Persians rather than the Noble Middle Eastern Autocrats presented in their Art are drawn by Miller to resemble African American Gangstas with piercings and Skin art everywhere.  I was looking for Xerxes to have a grill and whitewalls on his chariot. ---  --- If you were into "Sin City", you will love this mishmashed version of the Classical Tale of bravery and sacrifice in the face of overwhelming odds
I have never been able to see what the big deal was about this band.  All of their records, in general, sound exactly the same, and this one is no exception.  Post-Velvets guitar/organ drones, lackadaisical vocals, blankly uninteresting non-lyrics (they could have recited their grocery lists and it would have been more interesting), and a dramatic lack of energy; all of Yo La Tengo's trademarks are fully represented here, and if you can stay awake through it, you're a better man/woman than I.  A surpassingly boring record, even from this usually very boring band.  If you've heard the Velvet Underground, Neu!, Stereolab's early records, and Sonic Youth, you've heard Yo La Tengo in total.  If you're a big enough fan of those named bands, YOU could probably write songs that sound like "Painful." But you would probably write better ones. Avoid this like the plague unless you suffer from insomnia
Yes, I must admit that I was fooled by the "One of the most notorious, most debated, most banned films of the 'video nasty' era." line on this back of this movie case.  I was lucky because I found this at a Best Buy for $10.99.  It should be $2.99 for as bad as it is.  I've been let down by these Italian Horror Films one too many times.  If you want good, gore filled, Italian Horror stick with Lucio Fulci or Dario Argento.  Once you get past the bad dubbing and acting they're berrible.  Oh, by the way, unless you are fluent in Italian this second disk is almost worthless-there is no opportunity to even have English subtitles.  The only thing good about the second disk is the nudity and strong sexual content and that looks alright in any language
This Is a cool gun BUT...Has NO acuracy and the instruction manual is really hard to read i like it as a side arm but only in tight situations
We looked everywhere for this float after borrowing one while swimming at the lake with our 11 month old.  The nice thing about it is that it provides a safe and comfortable ride while allowing the child to be right in the water and splash around.  We can swim right alongside and spin him around or swim underneath to come and suprise him from the other side.  We don't have to worry much about the water being too deep because the float is so stable.  I would say the only drawback is that while it inflates fairly easily, squeezing all the air out and collapsing the float can take a few tries.  I would recommend this product to anyone with an older baby who wants to take their child for a float in calm water
Everything was great about this from the product to the promptness which it was received.
Unlike many of my friends this was not a traumatic time for me. However it took quite some time before I could read anything about the era. Now that it is so long ago that it is sort of a dream I wonder if I should have kept up with this magazine.  ---  --- I now find it intriguing and wish there was more on the area I was in. The major players are displayed but not so much the more personal information.  ---  --- Yet I have friends that were in many of the groups depicted in this magazine and it like any other specialty magazine of a time and place can hold special moments for them. ---  --- There is also a good magazine for people that missed their chance to take place in Vietnam in that time in history. ---  --- As with any experience if you ere not there then you can not know but this comes closest to an objective telling of history.  ---  --- Be sure not to overlook the ads as they are an intricate part of the magazine and offer some interesting items. ---  --- 1/10 th Cavalry 1967-68 Armed Recon.
This is an all-time favorite tea of mine. I spend hundreds of dollars a year on tea - and this tea really hits the spot in my favorite top ten list of teas. The only downfall about this tea is that it is not made with strings. I like to have strings on my bags of tea. But no matter what this is the best peppermint tea i've ever drank! ---  --- Celestial Seasonings is a great brand. ---  --- This tea will smell up your kitchen with a lovely invigorating scent. Perfect for the mornings.  ---  --- I also use this tea when my stomach is upset, if my joints are sore, to help with cramps, and to help with gas! Peppermint is a natural reliever for IBS, especially if you have the flu or a bad cold peppermint tea really seems to bring up your spirits and relieve stomach irritations
I have been using this product for about 3 months.  It is great!  Not only have I noticed a difference, but I get comments from people all the time about how refreshed I look.  I had a baby about 5 months ago and decided that I need to pamper myself a little.  I came across this product in January and was very cautious about purchasing another eye cream.  Nothing has worked in the past.  However, I decided to give it a try.  I noticed changes after a couple of weeks, but wasn't sure if it was just me wanting it to work or it actually working.  Well, now after 3 months, I can totally tell the difference.  I look so much better even without makeup.  I don't even need to put concealor under my eyes any more!!!  Plus, I receive so many great comments from people. ---  --- Thank you Hylexin.  Finally something that worked for me
I got Shrek 2 a couple christmases (is that right?) ago, and i gotta say it was alright. the pros are that it is up to four players ( so if dad wants to spend "quality" time with junior), it has a wide variety of fun characters, and plenty of levels.   ---  --- HOWEVER, it lacks graphics, and young children might not do well during the game. but overall its alright ---  --- Graphics: C/ It must have been released early, cuz it's pretty bad --- Sound: B+/ crisp sounds. the sound really matches the mood. --- Controls: A-/ Changing and controlling characters' a breeze ---  --- Good for children and adults to
Before you get all worked up, let me say that he has a voice, but he really doesn't have a style.  he sings songs way too straight, he makes even Bobby Short sound like an improviser!  He also doesn't seem to be in touch with his masculine side, his vocie is very, well if ying is male, and yang is female, he sounds very yang.  He needs to take some liberties with the songs he sings and then he won't sound so obnoxious, then he needs to take some vocal lessons and try to bring out the ying(masculine side) in his voice.  He needs to hear a few Billy Eckstine lp's.  I don't think he can change but here's hoping he'll take my advice.  As far as you buying this cd it is your decision, this is just my honest opinion
I'm in love with these sandals.  Although they are very lightweight, they are vastly more substantial, supportive and comfortable than most flip-flops.  I may have to buy another pair.  If you're a half-size, go down not up
This ab machine focuses your workout on the abdominal muscles like not many other ab machines do.  You'll be surprised by the results
I bought this for a quick trip based on the good reviews and the fact that the new Fodor's isn't out yet. This has a lot of beautiful pictures and good background explanations, but isn't great if you actually want to see much beyond holy sites and ruins. the maps are not comprehensive enough (the one for modern jerusalem  didn't cover a third of the city, and the one for tel aviv was tiny), and there is not enough practical information about food, hotels, and getting from place to place. I was disappointed.
This review is for the Coolpix 5900 with 5MP.  --- You will not be displeased with this camera if you are in the  --- market for a compact digital camera. This little baby lies  --- comfortably in your pocket until you want it and rarely fails  --- to deliver, no matter what lighting obstacles you throw in it's  --- path. The footprint is amazingly small for a 5MP and you'll be  --- amazed at the functionality. I found the video/movie feature to  --- be a real useful tool that surprises most people with the great  --- clarity and utterly blown-away at night shots in poor light.  --- Think of Las Vegas lights on the strip, or a crowd of people  --- in thin night light. This camera handled it all. The SD card  --- is easy to access, and I recommend a 1GB size so you can take  --- your time with movies. Otherwise a 512MB card will give you  --- about 300 photos. But I warn you, you will be bitten by the  --- movie bug and want to use this more and more (provided you have  --- disk space or burn the excess to DVDs). I also recommend the  --- San Disk Ultra II SD cards for fast recovery speeds, so you  --- don't have to wait for each shot to record before going to the  --- next shot (this is 5 MP and that's a lot of pixals to store).  --- The roll on the side of the body enables you to keep a tight  --- grip on it with one hand shots- a feature many small cameras  --- lacked. The battery life is exceptional, but as always, buy a  --- backup for travel. The hit of one star was for the frustratingly small on/off button. I know they designed it so that it won't accidentally turn on in your pocket, but my fat finger is not the best tool.... The 2 inch LCD is not protected like others too, but so far seems pretty tough, rolling around in my pocket with sunglasses and other things that so far have not scratched it. 
As we near the end of the life span of the last generation of consoles, key franchises that have appeared year after year begin to wrap up their yearly development cycle. Crazy as it may sound, Madden NFL 07 could be one of the last times we see Madden on the Xbox, PlayStation 2, or the GameCube. With that in mind, it's not altogether surprising that Madden 07 doesn't really push the envelope terribly far. The game includes a few new control features and some mode tweaks (nearly all of which are also available in the Xbox 360 version of this year's game), but for the most part, it feels like the result of a series pushed as far as it can possibly go on a given platform, and you definitely get the sense that Madden on current-generation consoles is beginning to wind down. However, for at least this last year, the veteran player outraces the up-and-comer in the Xbox 360 version, and there are certainly enough compelling reasons to check this year's game out on the older consoles.  ---   --- Madden NFL 07 brings back practically every feature that was in Madden 06. On top of that, a number of new gameplay upgrades have been brought to the table, the majority of which are available in all versions of the game. By themselves, none of these individual changes or upgrades is particularly game changing, but taken as a whole, they add a nice dimension of depth.  ---  --- These features include the highlight stick, a new kick meter, and lead blocking controls. The highlight stick is a new version of the truck stick used for runners on offense. Here, you can use the right control stick to pull off the sorts of crazy jukes and steps that star running backs are so well known for, and on top of that, depending on the type of back you're playing, you can opt to use more-powerful moves, or more finesse-based maneuvers. This feels like the natural evolution of last year's truck stick, though most experienced Madden players will be able to get by just as easily using the button-based moves rather than making liberal use of the stick. But if you take the time to learn the stick and figure out how to use it and the button controls together, you can be a very hard runner to stop.  ---  --- The new lead blocking controls are likely to inspire some new tactics from all types of players. Here, while on offense, you can opt to switch your controlled player to any of the available blockers during a running play. This includes offensive linemen, tight ends, fullbacks, or whoever else might be blocking on a play. When blocking, you can just do standard blocks, or you can even get dirty and do some mean-spirited cut blocks. This is an interesting mechanic, because it stops you from having to rely on CPU blockers, which as any experienced player will tell you, are not always the most reliable players on the field. You can also quickly switch back to control the running back once you've laid down your block, which is good, because the CPU running back doesn't always manage to find the holes you're creating. At first, you may find yourself unable to effectively use this feature, as setting up the right blocks isn't always the most intuitive thing in the world. But after some time, this control method gives the running game a really interesting new perspective, and those who love finding new strategies are bound to eat this up.  ---   --- The new kick meter is probably the most accurate representation of kicking available in a game thus far. With this meter, you use the typical arrow to line up your angle and then press down on the right analog stick to set up your power. The meter quickly fills up, and then you press forward on the right stick to set the power as well as your accuracy. The accuracy is based on the angle at which you press up. If you press too far to the right or left, the kick will get away from you. If you land it within a set space, it will go pretty much right where you want it to.  ---  --- Beyond that, the changes from 06 to 07 are mostly ancillary, and fundamentally, the game plays very much as its predecessor did. On defense, there are a few more available options in terms of positioning your defensive players, and you can commit your defense in a certain direction the moment the ball is snapped. On offense, the quarterback vision cone, which made its debut last year, is still available, though it's not a required feature. You can just tap the right analog stick after snapping the ball, and it will pop on, letting you use it for a little accuracy boost. No, it's not any more fun to use than it was last year, but that's not altogether surprising. Otherwise, pretty much every control feature you've come to expect from Madden is front and center once again. Potentially, some people could play through Madden 07 and never really partake in the new running control features, but there's definitely enough in all the available upgrades to add a significant layer of depth to the experience.  ---  --- Even though Madden NFL 07 doesn't have any big, game-changing features to make it an especially memorable iteration of the series, its roster of small, but useful changes are ultimately more compelling than anything Madden 06 had on offer last year. And while some people are undoubtedly over the notion of playing new games on old consoles, Madden 07 shows that it can still deliver some enjoyable football, regardless of what platform it's on. It's not a big step forward, and the similarities between this year and last year might be a tough sell for some. But it's those similar aspects that Madden 07 ultimately improves upon over its predecessor, and if you skipped out on 06, then there's no good reason to ignore 07.  --- 
For the price of this cradle/swing, I'd hoped for a lot more quality and reliability than I got.  First, the stand seemed a little wobbly--you really need to make sure that the feet are as wide as possible when setting it up as they don't lock into an optimal position.  Even worse, however, is that after less than two days of use, the lights, sound, and mobile stopped working.  Calls to "customer service" were a complete waste of time and I ended up returning the item.  While the netting and other features appeared attractive and desirable, I'd have to recommend purchasing a less expensive Papasan cradle/swing
This is the best game ever! If you want to play with your love ones, this is the best game to have with. You can be addicted to it sometimes, but that's a good sign for a good gam
The refills were easy to order & fit my brush perfectly.  It's a lot easier ordering on line & received in home rather than trying to find the merchandise in a store
It is a magnificient item! So simple and beautiful yet full of really small details and "hello, here is Johnny Cash!"  --- Looks really great on foot with his guitar. Just like real. I strongly recommend it to all Cash fans
Not Only Black + White is a great Australian magazine, and of top quality.  I used to buy it in bookstores here in New Zealand, but they don't seem to be available here anymore.  I am not subscribing to it, but I'd keep getting them if they were available in bookshops where I live.  I emailed the publisher twice about this, but I didn't get any response.  Aside from that, this is a great mag (yes, it has fine art nude pictorials as well as lots more) and one that you would hang on to like a "coffee table" book rather than treat like a typical magazine.  It has a thicker cover and pages than normal magazines too.  For a magazine, you could almost rate it a 5, but nothing beats a proper book (no advertising, etc), so I rate this a 4.  Aside from the photography, it also makes a good reference for page layout and typographical ideas as well, for anyone into desktop publishing
Granted this was on sale for 20 bucks, it was originall 75, it's poorly made, difficult to assemble and very uncomfortable to use
This film starts with an event based on a true crime. A talk radio show host in Denver was killed by an American Nazi. (This event inspired the "Talk Radio" play and film.) This film continues with scenes from a small town in a farming region. No mention of their economic status; are they losing dollars and population, small businesses, etc. Instead we see a small group of white racists who abduct a black man to hunt and kill him! This seems too exaggerated to believe. Federal agents are aware of this but don't want to act yet. Their agent is sent back to get more information. There are groups like that in some sparsely settled areas. The film doesn't explain what created them. It shows how some politicians try to use them for votes and contributions. No real names, of course. ---  --- The Federal agent meets to report to her higher ups. Then we see terrorists prepare to hold up a bank to raise money for their activities (based on real events). Most bank robberies are done by ordinary criminals who are not part of any group. (The FBI put an end to organized gangs that robbed banks in the 1940s.) This Federal agency doesn't interfere because they want more information on their aims (and their leaders). More terrorism is planned: dynamiting a courthouse, attacking a power station, etc. The terrorist plots here would keep this small group busy 24 hours a day! Kathy finds a secret list of "friends". This is quickly copied with a camera. The Federal agents need to know who this group will target so they can arrest them. Gary meets with the leader (who arrives in a helicopter!) And shows documents that say Kathy is a special investigator. Is Kathy being served up as a sacrifice? Gary and Kathy travel to Chicago, where an assassination is planned that will make Gary the fall guy. (Another Lee Harvey Oswald?) A second "lone gunman" shoots the politician in front of a building. Gary fails to shoot, and won't ever try this again. ---  --- Costa-Gavras gained world fame with his 1969 film "Z". A few years later his film about rebels in South America was popular. His later films have seemed mediocre. A better story might not have tried to cover so many details and plots as this film does; better pacing could help. The threat from domestic terrorism still needs a good film (e.g., Timothy McVeigh). Those who gave this film a high rating must love the images more than the facts. ---  --- A better film today would show the bad results from "NAFTA" and "Free Trade" in harming most Americans economically. But Hollywood would never allow a film about this "war on the middle class". The word `nafta' in Greek and Arabic refers to `petroleum'. NAFTA is a symbol for the policies designed for Big Oil. It is like George W. Bush calling his policy "Operation Iraqi Liberation".
I haven't been able to find the sizing info. for the sleepsacks on this site, so I called the Right Start (they also carry them but for $24.99) and they said that the large size is for 22-28 pounds.    Just thought I'd put this info. out there for everyone - hope it helps
I am utterly disappointed in the direction that Gamepro has taken over the past two years. I actually stopped my subscription for about 1 year, but came back to the 20 issues for $10 at their (10?) year anniversary.  I forget.  But the magazine is really bad. ---  --- One thing I laugh is, the retro corner.  They have info about issues from 5 and 10 years before, and they always announce the number of pages from 10 years ago. I think the most recent issue, they said: 140 pages?  Huh?  I think my last issue was around 100.  And don't try to tell me they've lost 40 pages in advertising.  ---  --- Too bad on-line reviews and websites, are taking over the subscriptions of the hardcopy magazines. I'll stick with hardcopy until the end of my life. Or until the quality of these types of magazines gets so low, I can't stand it anymore.  Or until my subscription runs out on this craptacular effort.  ---  --- You guys were pretty good 5 years ago, but you've gone to pot these past two years!  I'm talkin' to you Watchdawg!!! ---  --- You guys are suckin' lately!!! ---  --- MC White said:  You guys are suckin'!!
Well, I bought two of this. I have only used one and it works fine. Looks very nice and feels solid in your hands.  --- The only thing i dislike is that it sounds and vibs too much for my taste, but not a big deal..
I bought this thinking it would be a kind of sports watch - for swimming and running.  Unfortunately it is not waterproof for swimming, is unbelievably bulky, and has this strange time setting system which only works in the USA and Europe (I live in Australia). In the end I gave it to a relative in the USA
I've been a loyal user of Systemworks (also "Utilities" & AntiVirus) for many years, frequently buying upgrades as I moved through various Windows OSs.  The latest verison (2006) has been a big disappointment. ---  --- 1) The "integrator" repeatedly crashes (and "must shut down").  I was told to reintall (it took 4 hours).  Tech support (email) was slow and barely intelligible. ---  --- 2) The full scan now takes over 8 hours on a modest sized system. ---  --- 3) The utilities have not been substantially improved in 5 years ---  --- 4) The rebate (for upgrade users) came in the form of a debit card, not a check.  (What a hassle!  I don't want any more "plastic"!) ---  --- 5) Turning the Norton protection off substantially speeds up my PC.  What the heck is going on back there? ---  --- During the next year, I'll be looking for a new Anti-Virus support product. ---  --- Cheers, Joh
NOtice that the people giving it 5 stars are the people who reviewed this product and this product alone. ---  --- Sounds like employees trying to build up ratings
I first stumbled across this movie on cable in the late 80's. I loved it then and still do today. Great story, great casting, great acting & great period film making. Diane Lane is not to shabby either as a strippin' diva with a taste for the fast life. Matt Dillon plays a complete craps stud who can win any dice game no matter the stakes or cash on the table. Tommy Lee Jones, Tom Skerrit, Bruce Dern & Lee Grant all contribute with awesome performances to this "Gem Club" of a movie. I sincerely hope we'll all be lucky enough for this title to be available soon on DVD. Heck, I'd love to have a DVD with tons of extras too if it was up to me but it it's not. I can always dream though..
This toy needs work ... First of all, it's HEAVY!  My daughter (now 19 months) usually likes to pick it up and throw it.  After all, it IS a ball!  We have hardwood floors - throwing this ball is extremely loud and it can really do some damage to our floors!  We don't have any problems with it moving around ... however ... when you're asked to find something on the ball, even I have a hard time finding it to push the button in time.  So, I don't know how a 6 month+ baby/child could find the correct answer in time. ---  --- I think this is a nice idea for a toy, but it just doesn't work.  It is colorful, and my daughter does enjoy throwing it, but that's obviously not it's intended use.  She never played with this toy as a crawling infant.  She only plays with it now, and she only throws it.  Please don't waste your money on this toy.  It's not worth it
This Movie was very hard to find. Found it in DVD an it was new
The field of vision is too small for any useful viewing.  If you already know where your object is in the dark, then you can point this device towards the object and view it in dark.  But if you are searching for an object in the dark, the small field of vision makes the search useless.   ---  --- Also, there is too much "noise" in the image, thus making it very difficult to recognize the object that you are viewing. ---  --- The IR makes the field of vision even smaller.   ---  --- Overall I did not find this device useful even for ordinary pleasure viewing.   ---  --- By the way, if you own a camcorder with night-view, you already know how how the objects look in the dark.  You can use your camcorder's night view feature instead of buying this expensive devic
The massage portion of this heating pad is no more a massager than the vibrate on a cell phone.  There is only 1 heat setting, which is OK, but it's a bit hot for only one setting.  It's like the High setting on my 3 setting hot pad
Do NOT!! Order from this website! I purchased a subscription for Oxygen magazine on Jan. 30, 2006, and I still have not received the first issue. I am very dissapointed, to say the least!
This notebook is fabulous...its history inspires.  I think that it will be the last type of notebook I use for my journaling and writing.  I adore it
Boomwhackers are wonderful for teaching children or adults elementary music.  They are virtually indestructible and can be use in a variety of teaching situations.  And that are very resonable in price.  I do recommend also purchasing the Octavator caps. 
This is the second item I have ordered from this company, and I am extremely pleased with the quality and value for my money. I would recommend them to anyone
Nintendo hasmaintained their status as one of the most successful video game companies ever. Since they hit it big back in the 80's, they've maintained to be as synonomous with the way we play video games just as Microsoft has IBM has maintained the computers. A couple of years ago, Nintendo revolutionary changed the way we play video games with the DS handheld system. Not only has it worked very well, but it has changed the way we played video games with the touch of a pen. Earlier this year, the company redesigned the system with the DS Lite. Now, it has been remade, and it is pretty in pink. ---  --- The Nintendo DS Lite in Coral Pink, is a video game system not only designed for the hard core gamer, but the color makes it have a femanine touch for female gamers too, from its detailed color to its elequent pink-colored stylus. The screen is very crisp and clear, and deliver beautifully in its display. The graphics are crisper and clearer than the original DS system on so many different titles from New Super Mario Brothers, the action-packed puzzler Meteos, and new games like Star Fox Command and Mario Hoops 3-on-3. Not only that, but if you're a fan of Game Boy Advance games, you can play your GBA games on the system as well. The gameplay is crisper and delivers the best control, for the system, but also a easier way to play games that original DS owners had trouble tackling. ---  --- All in all, the Nintendo DS Lite is a great video game system because it is inexpensive and convient for the die hard gamer in not just the price, but the games too. I love this system a whole lot, and if you have the desire to own a video game system, I definitely recommend this one for everyone. ---  --- Graphics: A ---  --- Sound: A ---  --- Control: A ---  --- Fun & Enjoyment: A ---  --- Price: A ---  --- Overall: A 1/2
This item worked well for a month or so, but then began working intermitently after that. Eventually it stopped working all together. In my opinion it is a pretty cheaply made item. I would not recommend it
I struggled with the decision to buy this trike, thinking it seemed kind of cheap and plastic compared to the metal trikes of my youth. However, I ended up getting one for my 3 year old, and am going to order another for when my 1 year old is old enough. Whoever invented the rear handle steering mechanism is a genius, and me and my back thank them. I no longer live in fear of "daddy push me," since pushing doesn't require bending over to that terrible "pushing a tricycle" stance. The trike itself is lightweight and easy to maneuver. It has a low center of gravity and doesn't feel quite as tipsy as some. I recommend it
You will save a lot of time by using this OCR. Top notch accuracy and very easy to use. A must for all those who need an OCR. Don't hesitate
I made the mistake of subscribing to Make, based on the hype.  It turns out to be long and tedious, with instructions on how to make really messy junk of virtually no interest or use.  Successive issues have gone down hill, and by issue 4 they were dealing in vanity pictures of people's garage workshops.  Maybe you'll be the one in a million who wants to make useless junk, but buy a copy or two at the newstand before you subscribe.  It's not obviously wonderful
I had high hopes for this stuff. I have watched Blow Out and know that he knows his stuff when it comes to hair, but I cant seem to get this stuff to actually do anything for my curls and waves. I have tried it on wet hair, damp hair, dry hair-no discernable difference. I will stick to my Frederic Fekkai products-they actually work
The toothbrush is great, feels like you just came from the dentist and had your teeth cleaned
The Diaper Dekor is the best diaper pail on the market!  It's easy to operate and stays odor-free!  To get rid of a dirty diaper, just step on the foot pedal and drop the diaper in the pail.  Completely hands-free!  You don't have to worry about twisting anything like you do with the Diaper Genie.  When the pail is full, just pull out the bag, cut it loose on the door-mounted blade, and tie a knot in the top.  Then, just tie a knot in the liner that remains in the pail and you're all set for the next batch of dirty diapers!  The "continuous liner" concept is genius!  I've been using the Diaper Dekor since my daughter's birth ... and I'm still on the same refill that came with the pail.  I did, however, stock up on refills for the future by adding them to my baby registry! :-
I use the memory card in my Samsung d807 phone.  Works perfecty
I'd give this product zero stars if I could.   ---  --- I use the QuickBooks online payment service with version 2004, and last week it started telling me that they were discontinuing support for version 2004 with that online service, so they forced me to upgrade. ---  --- So I bought the upgrade, and when I ran the installer it wouldn't accept my serial number.  I spent forty minutes on the phone with tech support on a choppy line to India, and he still couldn't get it to work.  I finally gave up when the next step he proposed was to disable all of the services running on my computer. ---  --- I had heard from others, including an accountant, that this version was bad but couldn't believe it would really be this bad.  I'd used QB since the early-1990s and never really had a problem.  But this is really, really bad. ---  --- Intuit needs to go back to the drawing board with this version.  It's a TOTAL LEMON
I bought the refills primarily for the stylus.  My PDA stylus was bothering my arm and using this is easy and painless
I bought the V2000 last year and it has worked great since then.  The compass has always given me accurate directions and has lasted through one winter and one summer so far.  I always left my V2000 in the vehicle, although the manual did state that you should take the device with you when the temperature is hot.  The V2000 has visible at all situations.  I can see it clearly in the dark with the V2000's automatic backlight, and see it clearly on a sunny day.  Finding a good place to put the temperature probe, however, is a hassle if you want to get accurate results.  Calibration was also a hassle for me.  You have to be on leveled ground and make a fairly even circle in order to get accurate readings.   
My wife had one just like this for 15 years and it was time for a new one. This back is almost identical and better quality. Shipping was very fast and it came exactly as I expected
Homesite is widely recognized as "the" premier tool for coding HTML, client side, and server side code by hand. Adding it to your resume won't land you a job, but it will certainly boost your chances of getting an interview because it indicates that you are not a cheap, WYSIWYG junkie. ---  --- One of the things I like best about Homesite 5 is the adaptability it allows when coding in ASP.NET. I was able to find a plug-in, which when added to Homesite, recognized the .NET tags and colors them accordingly. There are similar plug-ins for just about every language out there. ---  --- If you are unfamiliar with HomeSite, are considering a purchase, but are not sure it's the right tool for you, here's a very brief description on how it works: This is not a drag-and-drop design tool that created the code for you. It is, in essence, a text editor on steroids. As you code BY HAND it will color the code for you, tell you when you've made errors, offer you a ton of help on knowing what tags mean, has a built in FTP client, helps you organize your work into projects, and a bunch of other functions I've never used. ---  --- Here's the main thing you need to know: If you're a HomeSite pro, then you are also a REAL developer. ---  --- To everyone who has whined about lack of support: What do you expect for less then $100? If you purchase a flagship product from Macromedia such as Dreamweaver, Studio MX, or Fireworks, you'll get all the support you'll need. ---  --- Also, I've been able to find PLENTY of FREE support from news groups and email lists that focus on web development. For every problem or question I've found someone who knows the solution. You can too!!! ---  --- Just a note: Amazon is behind the times. From the Macromedia website you can now purchase two versions ahead of what Amazon is offering. ---  --- Well worth the $99.00
I'd been shopping for a pair of running shoes and have tried on various brands.  These shoes surpassed others in fit, support, and comfort.  I'm so glad Kayano comes in wide sizes, because it fits my feet PERFECTLY!  I highly recommend!   
Just got it yesterday. It took a few hours for the clock to adjust to correct time. It is accurate and quiet. It's a beauty too. This is the 4th La Crosse atomic clock in my house (first analog one). Recommanded
this guitar i receieved has a warped neck; how dare you send this product out
This is a wonderful (and healthful) snack.  Crispy and tasty and low in calories. Each bag equals 1/2 cup of fresh fruit, and the dried crunchiness of these seems to intensify the flavor of the fruits.  There is also enough substance to meet the munchies moments.  I highly recommend these
This sling was only useful for a couple months because there is no adjustable strap. There are so many slings out there that are more functional and that you can use from newborn to toddle
I just received my brush(es) hair dryer yesterday 3/9/07 ... tried it out today - for 5 MINUTES ... I absolutely hate it.  It's the worst, by far, hair appliance I've ever owned.  I guess you get what you pay for ... but I've owned Revlon products in the past, and this was absolutely the biggest waste of money.  I cannot return it, because the return cost would be too expensive, too much trouble, and I guess it will go in the dumpster.  I hate it - don't make the same mistake I made.  One big problem is that the bristles are so lousy - not firm and doesn't grip the hair.  Just take it from this written testimony - it's a piece of junk
I also found this item at Target for $39.99. If you buy it at amazon or ebay, your wasting your money
I'm an old school comic book collectors and I bought this in order to see what the technology has done with the print page.  This is more about collecting the stories than it is about collecting the art--and I still find there's no substitute for the feel of those magical pages
This is a great product. a friend told me about it. i finally decided to get one. i had bleeding gums. in two weeks of regular use, bleeding has stopped and i can see that my teeth is getting whiter and and my gums are great. just be careful when using the water jet side. you must turn it on with the flossing part in your mouth, or it will spray all over the place :

I washed 'em and they shrunk up so small I can't wear 'em anymore, bummer
 ---         Lips need a little shimmer in the summer, which is why I'm a fan of  Laura Mercier's Lip Glaces.  While they do come in 14 luscious shades, my two current faves are "Cancun Coral" and "Miami Pink."  The "Cancun Coral" is a soft coral which I like for day wear, and the "Miami Pink" has all the sparkle and pizzazz of hot pink - perfect for evening (especially with Mercier's Pressed Powder Bronzer). ---  ---  All the shades are abundantly blessed with Vitamin E, Lanolin and Mineral Oil to soften and smooth lips.  These glaces aren't at all heavy or sticky - they're light, go on easily, evenly, and don't bleed over lip lines if you take a bite of something good. ---  ---  Glaces can be worn alone or over lip color if you want to give added gleam to a favorite lipstick
I'd never bought a perfume above ten dollars when I tried Burberry Brit's Eau de Toilette one day. I couldn't believe how wonderful the scent was, especially after it had been on for a while. I splurged on a bottle which seems set to last me for a long time (even with almost-daily use, it's still mostly full). I consider this to be my signature scent, and get many compliments on it
We got the clock, read the instructions, installed a battery and hung it on an East / West wall.  After the sun went down, the clock was able to receive the station and set itself to the correct time.  It has worked flawlessly for the last two months since we got it.  It's nice to have the correct time all the time and the kids don't worry about getting out on time to catch the bus because the clock is off
I'm a huge fan of the majority of the Philosophy line, along with adoring the Amazing Grace scent!  I thought this scrub would be perfect for the spring into summer period because of the light floral scent.  Boy was I wrong!!   --- If you love amazing grace, this smells Nothing like it.  IT smells like plastic flowers.. not appealing at all.  Even my fiance made a comment that the bathroom smelled like melting plastic.  If you want a fantastic exfoliator, try Gingerbread Man or the Margarita scrub.. those are devine!  I think I'll stick to my amazing grace body lotion from now on
This disk is truly as bad as Nitin's previous disks were wonderful. Take any previous Nitin disk, throw in some Alpha, a bit of Craig Armstrong, some predictable eco-freindly american diatribe, mix until extremely smooth and you have a prophesy. As with most prophesies there no good news about it. My prophesy is that anyone who buys this won't ever buy another Nitin dis
I bought this card about 10 months ago to go with my Nikon D70 and I've certainly had no regrets. I haven't tried pushing the card to its limits to see how quickly it can write, but it's been plenty fast enough to keep up with me in single-shot mode. The card is always ready when I am. Downloading from the card to computer via my SanDisk Imagemate is fast too. ---  --- I like it so much, I'm buying a second one today
In 1962 Elvis was given a script that would take full advantage of his flare for comedy and "fierce" timing,...the movie was "Follow That Dream,"...and he would never see this oppurtunity again for the rest of his career.Elvis deliver's a flawless "deadpan" comedic performance that is seamless from start to finish that will remind you of a young Andy Griffith.Through the innocent eyes of Toby Kwimper,..we see a different world,..a world not so harsh and positive to the touch.In the courtroom scene that would be the climatic event of the film Elvis deliver's one of the finest speeches I have ever seen on film,...and there is not a dry eye in the house.We see through this performance that Elvis the actor needed only a suitable script and then he would keep up his end of the bargain."Follow That Dream" is a wonderful motion picture that has an endearing cast of great actors who were among the best of their time,...and it shows.This was Elvis's crowning glory,..if that he had one.A finer performance by Elvis you will not find on film,..watch him shine
After months of searching, I found the out of print cd here.  I had never heard it, but after hearing the fabulous song "My Only" from the "Good as it gets"  movie soundtrack, I had to hear the album.  What a disappointment!  Oh well, it would have been hard to make a cd as good as that song
Cheap Trick's second album is very disappointing to me after --- the good, but raw, "Live In The Studio", 1977-76 recorded --- Cheap Trick. Almost all of the material here is so watered  --- down that it REALLY COMES OFF WAY BETTER on the later many  --- Live disks they did. ---  --- After a good start w/ "Hello There", a concert favorite for  --- many years, is the only thing here to write home about when  --- one considers how great all the tunes from this overproduced album sounded on the Budokan and other Live recordings later. ---  --- Tom Werman and Rick Niesen were on a show in 1991 that I had --- recorded on a tape once and Werman, noce a friend of Tom Petersson's said, quote: "My three albums with Cheap Trick --- got better and better...", to which the ever sarcastic Rick --- Nielsen said, "Selling, maybe." Not realizing that brother --- Rick was slamming him, Werman then continued, "Exactly"... ---  --- Oh boy. We now see why producing Cheap Trick albums through --- the years has become like playing Russian Roulette. It's not --- hard to get better than this and five months later the solid, --- but somewhat oeverrated 'Heaven Tonight' came out...(And the --- guys EVEN bought Werman back for Dream Police. Things turned  --- out better when Pete Comita, then later Jon Brant joined the --- band. Yep - the best was yet to come - in the '80'
This was the best stocking stuffer ever. And we got 4. One for each of us. Mine is know at my office, and my boss loves it
I want to believe all of the positive reviews; I really do!  But at the moment I'm still having problems with the downloading and uploading of the firmware.  I know, I know:  do it in recovery mode!  Whatever that is!  (Don't worry, I've been to the site and followed the directions 20+ times!) ---  --- And as for customer support...I got a message giving hours and "Good bye" ( I did called during the hours CS was supposedly open).  I had a MPIO and wanted something more reliable but once again find the software package and manual (so big and so little information!) are not intuitive or easy to use.  Maybe the Mac Nation is right. ---  --- And as for that first review posted here on Amazon.com, I hope that guy got a bonus; he must be working for Cowan! ---  --- Don
Chris Joss delivers some serious blaxploitation inspired grooves that will wisk you back to the times of bell bottoms, afros and platform shoes!  Joss' "You've Been Spiked" is a retrospective piece of marvellously produced tracks that pays true homage to an era that gave us some of the funkiest music ever!  In fact, this music sounds so authentic you would think they came straight out of the 70's...but it's all circa the 21st century.  It's good to know that there are still modern cats (especially on the ESL Record label)who know how to recapture music from days gone by.    
As I went through music school in the eary fifties I was confronted with "Lenny". Now at 72 I still have this pleasure. There are people in the NYP that are legendary as are the performances. This set will give me a huge amount of pleasure for what ever time I have left. It is a wonderful historical document but most of all a tribute-legacy that people will be wondering about many years in the future. Bob Allshouse from the Dana school of Music 1952-57 
WHAT TO DO IF YOU JUST BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT: Go outside and bang your head as hard as you can against the side of your house---Maybe that will knock some sense into you after you've gone looney trying to use this piece of junk!!! As many reviewers have noted, it is extremely difficult to get this bottle warmer to work properly. --- First off, the little vials you use to measure the water into are poorly marked -- Why did they choose to use teeny-tiny WHITE lettering? STUPID! It is then very tricky to get the proper amount of water into the vials. In fact the difference between say, level 2 and level 3 is maybe two drops of water! Trying doing that out of a standard faucet. In fact we use a filtered water faucet (with a thin spout) and it is still hard to get write. --- But that's easy compared to figuring out the right water-in-the-vial to formula-in-the bottle ratio! We are currently using a 4oz Playtex bottle (with the disposable bags) and are contantly playing a guessing game as to the right amount of water to use. Level 3--- still to cold, but wait, last night that same amount of water practically scalded the formula! And just try to use a vented-type bottle...Forget it! How about an 8oz. bottle? NO WAY! Either way to cold or way to hot. --- And even though we use filtered water, this thing still need to be cleaned with vinegar (as recommended) evey week or so. However, the cleaning barely hepls and after less than 8 weeks of use we now use the microwave more and more. Why? Because we know that 4oz. of formula will always need 6-7 seconds in the microwave...Every time
I said I was going to be honest in all reviews, and yes, I kinda clunkered on this one.  I hate this CD.  Simply put.  They can't sing, and the songs are boring. ---  --- I'm sorry I bought this CD, and other people might not like me saying that, but it's my opinion.  I listen to power metal extensively and there is MUCH better stuff out there like Symphony X, Nightwish or Sonata Artica. ---  --- Don't buy this, though, you might like it.  I'd definitely listen to it first
Just look at some of the virtues touted by the producers of California Red Seedless Grapes, 1 lbs: ---  --- --Great For Eating With Cheese  --- --Great For Fruit Salad And Also Makes A Great Snack For Kids  --- --"High in Vitamin A, C & Calcium"  ---  --- You can't help sitting back and staring in awe at California Red Seedless Grapes, 1 lbs for it's utility and virtues.  On top of all that, they're SEEDLESS!!!!  Praised by greek philosophers for their healing powers, grapes are loved universally by both Democrats and Republicans...yes, a bipartisan fruit needed so badly in a time of partisan divisiveness, congressional sex scandals and unpopular wars.  Grapes bridge the divide between states, both red and blue.  No one can deny the power and tastiness of California Red Seedless Grapes, 1 lbs
The article that receipt is difrente to that of the photo that appears. The conector to the camera is not USB/Fire Wire, but it is a type nini Stereo
This was not the entire version of the HBO Special.  I was disappointed because some of my favorite parts were missing from this DVD.  If I had known it wasn't the entire show I wouldn't have bought it
Because the ideas and strategies really work! Robert Allen gives more concrete information, real meat if you will in one chapter than these other so called financial authors do in an entire book. ---  --- I used the ideas from Robert Allen to buy my first home, nothing down 5 years ago and the value of my home has escalated BUT...the return on my investment on a nothing down deal is infinite!  ---  --- Hey...if you don't like Robert Allen, you can always read Jane Bryant Quinn and lose money with her advice. I was talking to a guy the other day in a book store who said he lost over 75% of his 401 (k) money following Quinn's "safe" advice. ---  --- OR...you can read those tabloid websites which are around only to attract the naive and also are out to sell you their generic junk most of which is plagerized Robert Allen ideas
I had one of these when they first came out and loved it.  This one is even better.  I would say it's a must have for someone that has trouble getting a steak medium rare.  Since purchasing this item, I once again have the perfect steak.  I am so glad I found this fork again.  I am one happy person
We actually went through two of these in two weeks. The first one cooked the bottom 20+ wipes, so we returned it thinking that it was simply defective. The second one did the exact same thing! We wasted so many wipes with this warmer, since they were "cooked". We have even emailed the company and sent them pictures, but never heard back from them. Save your money
The canopy bar broke only two days after Christmas.   --- Now I have a sharp end on the bed frame.  Not good --- for little fingers.  For the price, I thought it would --- have been a lot more sturdy
this is an alright camera. if you're an average teen looking to post some hot pictures on myspace, or just someone looking to capture a few choice family moments, this camera should serve you fine. ---  --- what i liked about it: --- 1. it's compact, lightweight and easy enough to use --- 2. pictures taken in daylight turn out pretty nice --- 3. the battery life on this camera is much better than on other cameras i've used ---  --- what i disliked about it: --- 1. it's a bit flimsy to be honest --- 2. attempting to take a picture in the afternoon, evening or early morning is near impossible without it looking completely washed out or too dark. even though it has a night landscape option, it doesn't really work. --- 3. the flash causes a horrible delay (but that's been mentioned like 9,000 times before) ---  --- this is definitely not a camera for glamour shots. i'd also strongly discourage buying it if you're thinking of using it to take pictures at music events
I have been a subscriber to Threads since it's inaugural issue, and have saved every one. The publishers, writers and editors have uncompromising standards for accuracy, originality and inspiration. While the magazine has evolved over the years, and away from accessory crafts such as knitting, it has nevertheless remained the premier publication for fine sewing. Some articles are geared towards the advanced sewers, but many basic techniques and information are shown and explained more clearly, in more easy to understand depth, than any other publication of it's type. The pictures and diagrams are professional and clear. The instructions well written. Even the advertising is worth perusing. Top caliber all around
This is a great DVD.  I bought it for my son, who has Special Needs.  He attends a lot of dances and is always on the dance floor, but has never been able to figure out how to do the Electric Slide or Macarena.  Neither my husband nor I knew how to do these dances either.  I played the "Party Line Dances" DVD, and asked my son to follow Shawn's instructions.  Pretty soon he was moving along with Shawn, and doing very well.  And by joining a few of our son's practices, my husband and I quickly picked up the dance moves too.  My son now participates fully, and we look forward to line dancing at our own occasions
My son is tiny- born at 5lbs 6oz and very much a preemie. I simply cannot imagine putting him in the infant seat without this. It keeps his entire body in place- not just his head. It provides great support and the soft white fuzzy side is very warm (we havnt used the other side yet.)  ---  --- My only complaint is its a bit akward to get the shoulder straps in the correct place around baby- but thats mostly because our baby is still very tiny. once he;s bigger and we can move the headpiece up it shouldnt be a problem
i bought the grados thinking i was going to experience heavenly sound, but that was not the case. I was pretty disappointed when i first heard them because to me, it wasnt much different sounding than my sennheiser hd202s and panasonic earphones. (note: i am not an audiophile and am just an "average joe" in terms of deciphering sound) But after a week or so, i am starting to appreciate them. They are much more comfortable than my hd202s (i wear glasses and the hd202s hurt my ears so much) and definitely sound better. But, if u ask me if they sound $69 dollars better than my hd202s, i would say NO! I am still trying to search for that "heavenly" sound or mind blowing experience from headphones so if anyone has any recommendations, please post them in your revie
As a subscriber to Martha Stewarts magazines I have to admit this has become my favorite, simply because its concise and interesting to boot.  Love the Week End dinner section, as well as the Recipe Index at the front of the magazine which is helpful when I am looking for something quick to consider fixing, but do not have the time or desire to sit down and read the whole magazine.  ---  --- Some of the other regular features that I like and find helpful are the Cooking for One section, since as a widow I hate wasting food and know of many other singles who want to eat healthy but need some ideas.  Also like the Wine Basics section which has enlightened me on new wines that I now like trying.  In Season is a great section because it reminds the reader what is in season, which makes shopping and cooking easier.  ---  --- The size of the magazine is nice because it slips easily into my pocket so I can recheck it while shopping to see what items I have highlighted to pick up.  This is also a great magazine for couples, singles of all ages, which is refreshing since so many magazines are geared to upper middle class, 2.5 children homes.  And... the magazine seems to improve with each new issue
Be cautioned when ordering this product. ---  --- What happened was I ordered this product a month ago, and was sent the flatbread version instead of the clear tub of bite-size version.  I called Amazon, explained my problem, they promised to fix it by sending me a replacement. ---  --- Well, the replacement came last week, and it was still the flatbread.  I'm not going to bother to call Amazon again because I know it will just result in them sending me the flatbread once again. ---  --- The flatbread itself was tasty and crunchy.  I think the seeds really helped to put more complexity into the flavor.  You can eat just the flatbread as snacks or maybe put a bit peanut butter or jam on top.  It tastes very different than wheat, and I like the taste of spelt quite a bit. ---  --- So please be prepared to receive the flatbread version when you order.  You may as well just order the flatbread version to start with and save yourself couple of bucks as well as having to call Amazon to straighten things out
I love the 5 point harness.  My daughter needed to get out of the car seat but still need more than a seat belt.  This seat was easy to install and we love it
It always seems like a holiday when my UTNE arrives.  It has never failed to delight me in my long tenure as a subscriber and fan.   ---  --- Nowadays, with so much of our "news" actually being political spin and hype, with that forced-fed feeling, it is so refreshing to be able to read interesting, tasty, thoroughly satisfying stuff that is not the run-of-the mill, banal, overly celebrity-focused junk. [Hey, I like celebrities just as much as the next guy, but I like to take a break once-in-a-while.]  UTNE respects your intelligence. It seems to arrive just on time, every time. ---  --- The focus here is on improving one's life and, perhaps, one's corner of the world (or just a corner of a room).  Sure, there is a progressive bent to the content (it used to be dubbed "the best of the alternative media"): there's ample pro-environment, pro-organic, pro-diversity, pro-spirituality content here. [Have they made "progressive" a dirty word, too???] I find it consistently conducive to recharging my batteries. ---  --- GO FOR IT.  YOU WILL BE AMPLY REWARDED.  Like entering a fresh, new world every two months.  You will likely read it from cover-to-cover
I have bought 2 seasons of Survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete. Very dissapointing. Guatemala  episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show. Just leaves you hanging. Exile Island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between Danielle and Cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show
I loved "The Incredibles," so I was excited to play the game.  I've only been playing video games the last couple years, and only off and on, so I'm really just a beginner.  Perhaps that explains the enormous difficulty I've had with this game.  My boyfriend is a long-time video game player, and he was able to do things in one or two tries that I labored for hours over.  Even using cheat codes did not really help me all that much.  I was surprised when I read the review that said the game was too easy.  I almost cried.  LOL  But seriously, unless you are a good gamer, you're probably going to be more frustrated than challenged by this game.  As for me, I guess I'll stick to action RPGs
I bougt this camera and a Olymus camera, both in the same price range, the Kodak camera was by far deficeint in quality of image and workmanship. Avoid this at all cost the Olympus was well made, durable, higher quality picture and ease of use
My first two black 15 cartridges worked pretty well in my HP Deskjet 3820 then the third one started to indicate low fluid level and stopped printing. I replaced it with a new cartridges but it refused to work at all. While repeatingly trying to reinstall it as tech support suggested, the etch tore. When examing the inside of the printer, I found that black ink had splattered around inside the mechanism area indicating a leakage.  The next new cartridge would not work either. $$ wasted.  Tech support said to have the printer repaired -- ya sure (after only one year of moderate home use and the warantee had ran out). Printer repair would cost me more a new one
Don't get me wrong...I'm as likely as anyone else looking for a "chick flick" to watch the latest Meg Ryan movie with the cute leading man....but this movie adds something extra. Instead of just dishing out the same old blather that most romantic comedies spout (girl & guy meet, girl & guy go through some conflict, but eventually guy & girl get together and live happily ever after) this movie actually takes the time to explore what makes a relationship between two people special and unique, whether that relationship is between two friends, lovers, or family members.  ---  --- This movie is also great because it expounds upon the HUGE role that a person's mind plays when it comes to love and sex.  ---  --- Kate Capshaw's character, Helen, is great for audience members who still haven't figured out that women are sexual beings and that it's OKAY for them to enjoy sex! (Even with a much younger man!)  ---  --- All the characters remind us that even though we may not have everything figured out, you can always learn some new tricks, no matter what your age. ---  --- If you're in the mood for mindless entertainment, I wouldn't recommend this movie. However, if you're ready for a touching and romantic but still lighthearted flick, this is a good one!
So far this is the best thickening mascara I have tried that are either sold in drug stores or at department stores. It is not sticky or gloppy and you won't look like Tammy Fay with spider lashes. I do however, have to apply two coats to bring out the more sparse areas of my lashes, but I have finally stopped my search for thickening mascaras. My journey ends here
The product works well for my space and needs. One note to Amaazon. When you ship a $400 item, thats semi fragile, and the box shows up looking like it was used as a make shift soccer ball, how does the consumer deal with physical damage? The item is so massive to ship back, and most likey costly. --- I experimented with buying an expensive electronic online because the price was right. I was worried how the shipping would be handled, and sure enough, I was worried rightfully. The DVD tray catches everytime the tray comes in and goes out. The top of the receiver/dvd player had been slightly caved in. Even with all the packing Samsung supplied, it could not protect the product from the shipping company. It will be such a hassle to try and exchange this, that I am not sure if I will be purchasing something this expensive and fragile online again. Other than that, I have purchased smaller items, and less fragile from Amazon with no issues. I realize that the shipping damage canot be held on Amazon, as it is out of their control. I just don't think I will roll the dice on something like this in the future. Too bad, it would have been nice to say good buy to brick and mortar pressure salesmen
I only ordered this because my child was begging for the swimming mermaid. I compared Amazon's listing with the manufacture listing and ordered. We did not get what we ordered... we got a barbie dressed in a mermaid costume, NOT the swimming one! This was from Santa and, I'm sorry, but seeing that type of disappointment in a six year old's eyes just breaks your heart. Of course, it was after the packaging was torn apart to get her out and into eager hands. For the first time in my years of shopping, I feel robbed

I've owned this smoker for 6 years and have had great success turning out turkeys, pulled pork, ribs, etc. ---  --- Couple of tips that took me some time to work out. ---  --- 1) Cover the water pan with some heavy duty foil after filling it. This'll prevent the liquid from boiling away too quickly. You won't have to refill it during the smoking, and it'll prevent the smoker from getting too "wet" inside. When I left it uncovered, I was getting steamed meat, not smoked. ---  --- 2) Drill a hole in the bottom of the unit, and get a drip pan underneath it. This'll allow any condensation to drip out rather than collecting in the bottom of the smoker and promoting rust. ---  --- 3) Get some heavy duty foil beneath the heater element. Makes cleanup much easier, and gets the heat reflected up to the food. ---  --- Have fun...
Just as my title states- this item was purchased as a gift.  My friend loves the pendant, but upon arrival it had a small scratch on the body of the horse
This litle gadget has come in handy on a number of occasions.  It's collapsable, strong, light and easy to use.  I wish the price was under $[...], but the best price I could find was on Amazon.com and it's what my wife wanted and loves.  We also bought one each of these for our grown children and they use them constantly.  A GOOD PRODUCT!!
Don't buy this stroller. The only good thing about it is that you won't be sad if you leave it somewhere. The "restraints" don't restrain at all. My one year old twins barely stay in it so when we're in a store they can reach very far to pull down all sorts of things. (not safe) The stroller barely fits through regular door ways - and I mean barely fits. It does not maneuver well at all and is difficult to stear. The "adult drink cup holder" snaps off when struggling to go through doors and I don't have to describe what a mess that is. I'm just lucky I don't drink hot coffee; otherwise I would be suing the manufacturer for burns to the children. There is no storage. The "saddle bags" can hold a few small things but you should only use it for things you don't mind the children being able to reach. This stroller is not only a nuisance, it has potentially dangerous features, so please don't buy it
The best Cleopatra that the movies has ever produced.Be it in the scenario as well as the performance of an actress in the part. --- So many came before and so many after Elizabeth Taylor however to me Cleopatra will always be Elizabeth Taylor. --- A mega movie, with fantastic costumes, and acting, is a classic in historic movies.If you are history lover you should have this movie in your collection
however it only a six day cooler if it rarely opened but it a great 3 day cooler in hot weather for normal opening to get drinks out of  --- thant that is very impressive as most coolers can go more then a day or two when there opened frequently
From the beginning of Ruby's story, through all the footnotes of life, to the burying of Bunty...we live four generations of the Lennox family.  This is not your average family, people disappear, mothers leave families, children die in mysterious ways.   ---  --- For me the best of all the little stories, is Ruby getting ready to be born. Atkinsons description of being literally in the womb is priceless.   ---  --- Two themes seem to pervade this book...poor marriages to drunks and pregnancy out of wedlock.  In the end, Ruby learns the greatest lesson of all the women in this book...you can't run away from yourself. 
 i had heard of cannibal ferox for quite some time before watching it. i heard that it was the most violent film ever made. i enjoyed umberto lenzis eaten alive and thought this would be even better. i was dead wrong. cannibal ferox is a boring, unpleasent film that definatly doesnt live up to its infamous reputation. im not saying that cannibal ferox isnt gory or violent but i cant see how it was ever banned in 31 countrys. the few gore scenes are pretty effective, but that dosnt make up for the films many many flaws. if it was for giovanni lombardo radice[one of my favorite italian horror actors] starring in it, cannibal ferox would only earn 1 star.
I don't speak a word of french,and I barely read it, but I love this magazine!!! If you love fashion, get a french dictionary,I did, this is a magazine to savor! I have every issue since Ms. Roitfeld took over and will keep them forever! This magazine is very sexy, modern, french, well edited, up to the minute, bold, well designed(Fabian Baron) intelligent, I could go on and on, I've seen/get all the rest, including Vogue Italia, this edition has all the best stylists, photogs, and editors, I can't wait for the next issue!
I was amazed on how well this battery has performed. I did make sure when I got it I did a complete charge and complete discharge and it has not let me down since. I can shoot well over two hours without needing to change to the very meek battery that came with my camcorder (Sony HDR-HC1). It is thicker and sticks off the back a little bit more so you can not get your eye up to the eyepiece but I use the LCD when shooting anyway, and almost always on tripod
i dont know what can i write . i want anything about art exactly about painting,drawing,modern ar
I think the most striking part of this book is that you feel comforted by the fact that the problems you're facing in your own relationships are commonplace. They're not dysfunctional. Every family has its share of issues and you don't need to feel overly guilty for yours. The book's underlying theme is that families that honesty, consideration, character, belief and perhaps above everything else - resilience, can get you through the worst debacles and that at the end of the day it's probably (though not always) worth the effort. ---  --- Stories include: --- Resentment about controlling parents who appear to display conditional loving and also about appreciating how much of their lives parents sacrifice to bring the kids up; the search for redemption after abandoning a kid or cheating on a wife, the courage required to break relationships that are dead and the perseverance required to bring one back from the dead (and the effect on kids), dealing with the families of your in-laws and family objection to marriage, how to deal with kids who are falling into bad habits when you feel powerless to influence their decisions because they no longer respect you or listen to you, dealing with the death of a child, how we feel obligated to spend time with our families rather than actually wanting to spend time with them and what we are losing, etc. ---  --- Although it may seem that most people cannot relate to these situations... actually I felt an amazing amount of empathy for the families and came away with a renewed conviction that I can get the perfect family life (with all it's frustrations and headaches) and balance it with everything. ---  --- If you have any relationship, friendship that you have a certain amount of frustration, resignation about then I strongly recommend this book. It is one of those books that if it hits you at the right time - it could change your relationships and your life
Not worth the buy. Very hard to use in the pool. Vendor delivery service was great
I expected much better quality from Thule. As used according to the manufacturers recomendations, this bag did not even last one trip from New York to Chicago without it's interior lining cracking and completely flaking off. In addition, the back of the bag ripped creating two large holes in the fabric and the zipper attachments became loose and proceeded to pound at the roof of my car. The contents shifted continually during travel making for a loud noise that's not unlike a pouring rain hitting the top of the car. This becomes a terrible distraction while driving. All in all I had a very bad experience with this product and would not reccomend it. Opt for one of the solid constuction type carriers, they cost much more, but are worth every penny. In the end I thought I was saving money with this product but wound up having to purchase a Sears X-Cargo container to replace it for my return trip back.
I am new to this type of device, but it has performed as expected
I discarded the DVD after watching it. If you do not want to have the impression of witchcraft in your home don't buy this version of The Secret Garden.

This is a great bra for any mother that is looking for a nursing bra!  I live in the US and had a terrible time finding this bra in any store or anywhere on line.  It's a fabulous bra. It's very comfortable, washed up nicely and provides great support.  This is our second child and I wish I had these with the first
There were too many characters, disjointed plot threads, not much of a plot in the first place, and not much coverage of the overall march itself.  It focused on many obscure and unimportant characters who weren't that compelling
This is the best of the best.  Hands down this is one of the best broadway concerts you will EVER see.  Colm Wilkinson, Lea Salonga, Michael Ball are all amazing.  Fabulous talent, great singing
John Mayer can grow his hair long and play his guitar slung low, but he is still a professionaly trained monkey, I mean musician. Mayer along with "artists" like Gavin DeGraw, Teddy Geiger, etc., are todays N'Sync and Backstreet Boys, nothing more. 
fits the cell phone well and seems secure. i like the catch that holds it on the belt to keep it from slipping off the belt when sitting dow
I am very disappointed in this CD.  Not because the music isn't good, because it is.  But because it is just not the Pat Green that used to play in Stillwater.  The passionate, soulful Pat Green.  Back then he sang about things that he believed in and loved.  Now he is singing what Nashville tells him to.  And this coming from the guy who sang "Nashville Sucks" with Cory Morrow.  There are a ton of country singers out there that could have released this CD and it would have sounded exactly the same.  But songs like "Southbound 35" and "Three Day" can only be sang by Pat Green.  He needs to revisit his roots and come back to the red dirt country music that he was born to play.  Will the real Pat Green please stand up
I'm not an expert on footballs, but I haven't seen anything wrong with the way this one is performing.  It's easy to grip and throw, and it doesn't have that cheesy "hey I'm a recreational football" look to it.  Good deal for the money
Yes the game has been missing the constant songs about drugs, girls, cars and jewelery. I tell you Juelz really came with an original formula with this album. The stuff he mentions on this one has never been said before and Juelz is an innovator as well as the rest of the dipset. LOL!!!! These guys listen to other peoples albums and just reiterate the same stuff in a different song and beat. Save your money
If this had been the first album in the "Hip-Hop Hits" series, it would not be a promising start. There are a few decent tunes on here, but as someone who admired the quality of the earlier Source albums, I must express an intense dislike for "Hip Hop Hits Vol.8". There used to be a time when The Source gathered the biggest AND best tracks from the rap indusrty for their compilations, now Benzino has turned the series into a shameless promotion for his own favorites (How else do you explain Ja Rule being here?). Here is a song-by-song analysis of this disaster: --- (1) YoungBloodz feat. Lil Jon  "Damn" C-. This song is perfect example of why people are getting bored with "Sothern Crunk". It's lame and boring, as it shows Lil Jon becoming a one-trick pony. Not a good song to open an album with.        --- (2) Wyclef "The Industry" B. Wyclef is very talented,but this song was never a hit. It should be heard for its quality though, even if it only touchs topics breifly. It is clear that Wyclef is above most of his peers in everyway; sorta like 2Pac.   --- (3) Chingy "Right Thurr" B+. Not my favorite rap song,its better than average though, it kinda grows on you. He reminds me of Juvenile. It's content is not original, but Chingy makes it his own with a relaxed flow and style.  --- (4) Young Gunz "Can't Stop, Won't Stop" C. If this standard work is what Roca-A-Fella has in it's post-Jay-Z future,the label is going to be in real trouble. They're good, but they have to be better than good to stand on their own.   --- (5) Westside Connection feat. Nate Dogg "Gangsta Nation" B+. It was nice to see Westside together again. The style and talent cover up for the somewhat standard material. At the bare minimum, the song is stylistic and very enjoyable.     --- (6) Ja-Rule "Clap Back" D. This anti-Eminem dis is just border line pathetic and lame. Any Eminem song is a bigger hit and better than Ja Rule's weak new stuff. If Ja Rule wants to return to his position "Pain Is Love" brought him to, he must work much harder.      --- (7) Kanye West "Through The Wire" C. Kanye West has enjoyed chart success through alot of hype, but I find this song to be very pedestrian for rap. The lyrics don't define Kanye as an original rapper, and the use Chaka Kahn's "Through The Fire" doesn't make a very appealing beat.    --- (8) Gang Starr "Skills" C. The group isn't that good to begin with, and this song has none of the fun that "Militia" had. Gang Starr has a decent, hardcore sound that needs to be refined in order to define themselves. --- (9) J-Kwon "Tipsy" B-.This song is fun to listen to, but that still does not make it any better than average. It's not really about anything and gets kinda tiresome towards the end; you may be looking at your watch. He's too overpraised.        --- (10) E-40 feat. Clipse "Quarterbackin" C+. The track is enjoyable but was never that popular and is pretty forgetable. E-40 and Clipse just aren't that talented. It almost feels as if it was made strictly for the "Madden Football" video games". --- (11) Fabolous feat. Tamia "Into You" A. Just great, hip hop with style and substance. It's so nice to hear a gentler, more positive hip-hop songs; one that doesn't hammer the listener, but brings out emotions lightly. He is one of the best rappers of 2003; with both his album and it's singles. --- (12) T.I. "Be Easy" C-. He has been compared to Jay-Z and Nelly; despite the difference that he lacks the talent those artists have. Plain, boring, generic rap from an artist who ofers nothing new to the game; no more needs to be said. One must also wonder why this was chosen over his bigger (not exactly better though) hits "Rubber Band Man" and "Let's Get Away".        --- (13) Cassidy feat. R. Kelly "Hotel" B-. A sorta fun track, R. Kelly does as much as possible, but he even he can't make Cassidy sound original. To be honest, this was a huge Top 10 hit though; so it kinda does belong here.  --- (14) Ying Yang Twins feat. Lil' Jon & the East Side Boyz "Salt Shaker" B+. Surprisingly, the beat and production make this song rather entertaining. It's much more fun than it has the right to be; given the non-spectacular artists involved. --- (15) Scarface "Recognize" C-. Scarface used to be an exceptional rapper, but now he's trying to regain glory that is no longer his. Why listen to this, when you could just buy his older albums?       --- (16) The Untouchables featuring Benzino "Relationship With Me & My Gun" C-.Just a standard Benzino track tacked on for shameless self-promotion. I wouldn't mind so much if the songt had actually been worth listening to. Atleast "Bang Ta Dis" on "Vol.5" was a good song.  --- Bottom Line: *1/2. Benzino has ruined the once great Source series in the blink of an eye. If you want to hear a great Source album, buy "Hip Hop Hits Vol.4"; a Source album with the BIGGEST AND BEST raps of 2000. A few good tracks are not enough to balance out all the mediocre ones. To put it in short terms: with so many good compilations out there, why spend money on a bad one? I would not buy this album with a gift card.  
I love the shoes, they're quite comfortable even though the heel is a little higher than what I like. They're a beautiful color, something you don't always see, and quite eye-catching.  And they just so happened to go very well with a suit I purchased months ago.   ---  --- As a "Nine West" Fantatic, thank you Amazon for having them available! --- 
This is a good product if you like your tires to look new but not too shiney. It could last longer and attract less dirt though. Amazon shipped it pretty quickly considering it was for free
this shampoo made my dandruff even worse.  after using it, it did make my scalp feel cool and cleansed, but an hour later i combed my hair and there were huge flakes in it.  if you have to pay a little more for a dandruff shampoo buy paul mitchell's tea tree shampoo or something. 
I searched for new seatcovers only to find Hawaiian flower prints in almost all automtive stores. Then I found Amy Brown Moonsprite seatcovers. These were reasonably priced and were not some flower print. There's more to these, they have a soft feel to them like velour. My last set were nylon and some days would develop static and shock me every time I exited the car. The other thing is  --- there are other products like floor mats that have the same moonsprite logo
I am very surprised how well this case fit my Razr V3M. It fits very well and looks very nice.

Other reviews have homed in on the frequent nit-picking and general vindictiveness of this book.  I agree with these criticisms, but I'm not going to revisit them here.  The deeper problem lies with the Ayn Rand Institute, which only gives scholarly access to persons guaranteed to toe ARI's party line.  As long as the Ayn Rand Institute refuses full, unconditional scholarly access to Miss Rand's papers, any biographical efforts produced under their aegis will not be taken seriously by anyone who respects proper academic practice.  Nor should they be.

i have a huge head but these headphones are not a problem.  the metal band easily deforms to accomodate a dome such as mine.  the sound quality is ridiculously good.  they are very easily powered as well.  they sound loud and clear through my toshiba gigabeat which doesnt get quite as loud as an ipod (because of their efficiency they are actually louder than the 8 ohm impedence earbuds that came with the gigabeat).   ---  --- my head is a little sensitive so i am looking into some replacement ear cushions or some way to mod the ones i have.  these phones do leak a lot of sound though.  i wouldnt feel right using them on a plane or in a library or anything because they are very open.  you might want something semi-open or closed if youre doing travelling since they let in plenty of sound as well.  overall fantastic headphones, worth every dollar
As a peripheral BNL fan, I have always admired the off beat sense of humor these guys dish out.  With previous releases, I have been able to discover new things in repeated listenings.  This cd got stale fast.  Seems to be geared to the tween crowd.  I am hopeful newer releases will stay true to the BNL I have enjoyed in years past
I heard how good the Haribo brand was and decided to give it a try.  Amazon was out of stock of the regular gummi bears, and I didn't want to wait so these looked like the next best thing.  Now I am hooked and plan on buying more when my 5 lb bag runs out
I love this clock because it has it all in a slick package for a good price.  The battery lasts forever, so it's portable, the time sets itself atomically, it shows the temperature, has the obligatory annoying alarm clock, the time lights up on the ceiling, and it looks good to boot.  Very well-made and highly recommended.  Oregon Scientific rocks
These are great, the whole family loves them and they have 5 mg fiber per package. Really tasty, nice and crunchy. I have several boxes of them in the car for when the little ones need a little something when we are on the go. Other snack ideas include those little raisin boxes (but then raisins get everywhere) and packages of dried fruit (which seem to work pretty well since they are not as sticky as raisins). These All-Bran snack bites really go over well and they are much healthier than candy.  ---  --- I sure wish Amazon would sell these online
I will only use Krusell products as they are better than Best. Customer Service is as good as the product. There is no finer quality and the selection of products is well above the rest. Krusell products cost a little more but quality and durability far surpass the price. The rating should be a 10
I do a pretty good bit of video production. I have used let's say most of them in the quest of finding a video editor that would do the real things I need. Ulead Video Studio 10 Plus is pretty good, but it lacks in the audio section. Pinnacle: not worth the bucks I paid for it at Best Buy. Magix: nice but seriously lacking the depth needed in the audio section. --- I had used Premiere Pro before and liked a lot of the features provided in it but the price, my god, was just too much. I found Premiere Elements on Amazon and hoped that it would do the job. It did. --- Elements 3 has almost and I say almost features as does Premiere Pro. Some features have been streamlined for the amateur but learning to use Elements has been fun and productive.  --- I would recommend Adobe Premiere Elements 3 to any intermediate to advanced video editing person
I once read an article in Horn Book Magazine (a review source of titles and articles on children's literature) that lamented the millions of poor translations of Hans Christian Andersen polluting the minds of our young people today.  The review mentioned that stories like, "The Snow Queen", which were originally written in a snappy vernacular, have been dumbed down and drained of all energy by their American translators.  With this idea fresh in my mind I found myself in possession of a very particular copy of "The Snow Queen" and I was able to test this theory myself.  Now due to the wacky nature of Amazon.com, the website has lumped together the reviews of every single version of this Anderson story.  You will see that some of the reviews refer to Nilesh Mistry's, some refer to the audio book, some to Eileen Kernaghan's, and some (God help us all) to Mary Engelbreit.  None of these, however, are the version that I am reviewing.  After careful consideration, I selected the edition retold by Amy Ehrlich and illustrated by Susan Jeffers.  The Ehrlich/Jeffers team has banded together to bring us every fairy tale from Thumbelina to Cinderella.  With this 1982 classic edition, they bring all the creepy and crawly elements of Andersen's riveting tale to a kind of tame middlebrow life. ---   --- Most people don't remember that "The Snow Queen" begins when the devil creates a mirror that reflects everything good as bad.  By a quirk of fate the mirror is smashed one day (the details of this accident are left unclear) and the tiny pieces go spinning into the atmosphere.  If these splinters enter your eye, everything will look ugly to you.  If they enter your heart, it will turn instantly to ice.  Got it?  Good.  Cause sure enough, two small pieces enter the eye and the heart of a boy named Kai.  When this happens he stops playing with his best playmate Gerta and instead falls under the seductive spell of the mysterious and magnificently pale Snow Queen.  Gerta goes in search of her friend but is waylaid by a variety of different adventures.  She escapes an overly loving old witch, is taken in by a prince and princess, falls into the power of a thief girl and her kin, and at last saves Kai from the Snow Queen herself.  By the end of the book, neither kid is a child any longer and their home is just as they left it. ---   --- Obviously "The Snow Queen" is one big ole story about growing up.  The idea of the devil's mirror causing someone to despise anything they see and grow a suddenly cold heart... well that's just another way of describing adolescence, is it not?  Andersen obviously borrowed quite a lot from that classic old tale, "East of the Sun, West of the Moon", in which another girl goes off to save the man she loves from the machinations of a wicked woman.  Heck, "Tam Lin" was probably an influence as well.  The best version of this particular story I ever read was by Kara Dalkey.  It was a tale named, "The Lady of the Ice Garden" and can be found in "Firebirds: An Anthology of Original Science Fiction and Fantasy".  It is not, however, appropriate for children.  Kids today will probably look at "The Snow Queen" and instantly think of the White Witch from "The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe".  I cannot think, however, that this is a bad thing.   ---   --- As for the Jeffers/Ehrlich version, it's all right.  As an illustrator, Jeffers has apparently decided to make Kai and Gerta definitely children.  I guess that lowers the creepiness factor when the Snow Queen lures the boy to her sleigh and wraps him in her furs.  Jeffers really captures beautifully every diamond in the Snow Queen's dress and every strand of her white white hair.  There is the odd stylistic choice here and there, though.  When Gerta surprises the prince and princess in their bed, it is not your typical mattress affair but rather large his and her flower petals.  I can't think that they're comfortable (or even particularly practical).  The illustrations have been created, according to the book, "using a fine-line pen with ink and dyes.  They were applied over a detailed pencil drawing that was then erased".  As a result, the book is as soft as a colored pencil, but with a level of detail and intricacy normally associated with pen and ink. ---   --- Obviously I don't know enough about the original version of "The Snow Queen" (or, as Andersen called it, "Sneedronningen") to know whether or not this book is a worthy version to read to your tots.  At any rate, it tells the full story, warts and all, and will provide them with what may well be the most Freudian-toned fairy tale ever to grace their little brains.  A fun edition of a rather odd tale
Not much else o say, they look and wear awesome. The price is very good as well.  recommend these for anyone with pierced ears
These earrings are very pretty. They are a nice size and they aren't heavy at all, very lightweight. I have had them for a week or so now and have gotten nothing but compliments on them. They are great and so is the price! The vendor sent them very promptly and there were no problems.
'Introducing Postmodernism' is a good source to gather names of philosophers, architects, artists, anthropologists, linguists, and everyone in between that have been somehow connected to PM. The problem, and it is a big one, is that this style of tour de force writing does little to contextualize all these diverse disciplines. Sure, if you only have half an hour to read up on PM, you can whip through this book and go on with your life. But if you're wanting to really absorb the phenomenon, and perhaps go on to read more, this book is NOT the place to start. Check out David Harvey's 'Condition of Postmodernism.' This will rip the top of your head clean off! It's much more weighty (in every sense of the word), but your understanding of PM will vastly improve, and will better prepare you to go on to other important writers of the 'genre'
Wow, this book should be given to every graduate entering the workforce along with their diploma. Not just about cards, but also contains business etiquette, marketing tips and techniques, and (un)common sense. Wish I had read it 20 years ago. Required reading for pretty much anybody who has to go out into the world and deal with another person
Along with reception of new HD stations I expected high quality FM & AM to go with my complete top line stereo system. Instead, the HDT-1 gives me very poor quality, even less than a table-top clock radio. Very high output - can only turn amp up to lowest level - and painful to listen to. No response to inquiries from Sangean.

I received my Stamina Products Adjustable Hyperextension Bench on March 13th of '07 and was very disappointed. There was hardly any insulation whatsoever in the box and it looked like it was just thrown in the box. The product was scratched and parts were broken.  ---  --- Fortunately the bench works, but it looks like it is already a few years old with all the damage. The product seems to be of quality, it's just unfortunate that SPS doesn't understand how important that packaging is and if it is insufficient it makes the product look cheap

I wanted to like BROTHERHOOD, for the simple reason that nearly every New Order fan this side of the galaxy has dismissed it, usually with a faint whiff of snobbery (or at least apathy). Turns out they were right: BROTHERHOOD is half an album. Most of its nine songs feel unfinished, as if the band wanted to cash in on the success of their 1985 smash LOW-LIFE and didn't care about the end result. BROTHERHOOD is a rush job, plain and simple, but there are still glimmers of hope within this bare-bones effort.  ---  --- "As It Is When It Was" overcomes the album's overall muddy production by dint of being mostly acoustic, and the melody is quite lovely. "All Day Long", the emotional centerpiece of the album by default, is an intelligent (if half-hearted) protest against child abuse. While "Angel Dust" lacks a decent hook, its subtly danceable beat and effective synth noodlings will at least briefly hold your interest. And the toss-off "Every Little Counts" has a charming sense of humor that is too often lacking in New Order's work. ---  --- The most popular song on BROTHERHOOD is, of course, "Bizarre Love Triangle". So good it seems to belong to a different album entirely, "Bizarre Love Triangle" is truly New Order's masterpiece. The solid beat, slick sequencer work, and gorgeous melody showcase the band at their best: catchy, danceable, and downright euphoric. (Imagine how well it would have fit on LOW-LIFE.) ---  --- Sadly, the rest of BROTHERHOOD is unremarkable. The album's production neatly mixes rock with electronic flourishes, which has become New Order's signature sound, but the songwriting doesn't measure up. Buy the album if you're a trainspotter, but casual New Order fans would be better off picking up LOW-LIFE or 1983's POWER, CORRUPTION AND LIES. This one is just a footnote.
I got one of these because it was only a penny. I used it several times with only a slight crack that I later cemented. Later I used it again, and, while cocking it back, the whole top piece just splintered into many pieces. The gun is fun for about the first few tries then it's prone to jamming up. Even though it was only a penny, it was $4.99 shipping. I'm better off getting one for about a dollar at a flea market. I'm not very satisfied, but I'm not spending 40 cents to get my 1 penny back
Waste of time. Software had some bugs but more importantly performance was horrible.  I wouldn't pay 10 dollars for this product- yes it is that bad.  Accuracy rate was about 25% and the mistakes were beyond spell check.  They look like some new form of reformed egyption. Don't buy!
A wonderfully complete set for toddlers to set up a complete dinner just like Mommy & Daddy.  the pieces are easily recognizable and realistic.  The children enjoy sharing the dinner with their "friends"
I received the Chia Herb Garden about 3 years ago and not only was it easy to start, but most of the plants are still going strong.  I have more chives and parsley than I know what to do with.  These are also some of the tastiest herbs that I've ever eaten
I tried to tune my daughter's violin for about an hour without luck. --- The manual is not clear, I should say "not enough" instruction for first user like me. --- Finally, on the next day, after asking a friend who already used the tool (but different brand), I could get it done. --- Since the unit is good quality, very sensitive to catch the sound, I rate it 4 stars
You will need this extra base!! I ordered it thinking it would probably be a good idea to have. The day after it arrived my mother-in-law was sick and couldn't come over and watch the baby so my husband placed an emergency call to a relative and they were able to come over and pick him up. I had the original base with me at work 40 minutes away before this all happened
I had purchased two of these Smack and Yack cars for my grandson.  While wrapping them the night before I planned to give the gift, I discovered that they did not make noise as advertised.  If I had looked at them earlier, I would have returned them for a refund.  It's no fun to have grandchildren that are disappointed
These are great blades, installation is very straight forward.  The only gripe I have about these blades is the contact of the blade and the windshield at the extreme right where it ceases to touch my windshield which is about a 1/2", but the odd thing is that the tip does touch my windshield on the up stroke.  But it is so minor that it would not affect the rating at all since these blades has to fit onto so many different cars.  I guess there are no replacement for factory blades
When Mike & The Mechanics ushered in the `Madchester' scene with The Living Years it was only a matter of time before these jokers attempted to jump on the bandwagon. If you want to be adored you should write some decent songs lads! --- Verdict: don't waste your money.
There is only one 100% whole grain bread recipe in this book.  Most of them are less than 50% whole grain.  If you want healthy bread recipes try "Breadtime" by Cheney or "The Laurel's Kitchen Bread Book" by Robertson.  Every recipe in both of those books is 100% whole grain.  I doubt that most people considering a book titled "Whole Grain Breads..." are looking for recipes that contain just a small portion of whole grain ingredients.  With that being said I thought the book had some good recipes and was well written.  Therefore, I am willing to give it 2 stars as opposed to none. 
I used this cream for three weeks, two times a day and it did make some part of my circles lighter- from brown it went to pink. But I skipped one day and it all went back. You pretty much have to be tied to it and keep using it two times a day
The End of Democracy (2003) is the best answer to this theory
Well what else can I say.  I love Zatarain's.  Add a little sausage and you have a great quick meal. 
I got the hang on the 21% and all they could tell me at tech support is to shut down extra services. Well the only services I had running was the security services (firewall and antivirus). As an experiment I tried loading it on two computers set up identically. On one I shut down the antivirus and on the other I shut down the firewall. Neither would install. So I shut down both on both computers and it installed perfectly on both. I cant believe that they want you to shut down security in order to install. Makes me wonder.."What are they hiding that they dont want me to know about". I checked adaware and a registry cleaner and even ran my AV again and found nothing but still... It makes you wonder. Also the layout is very poor, so buggy they have many, MANY patches and updates. Will not print forms correctly and want to charge you fees to e-file when it is free from the governments. They just want more money.  ---  --- In my opinion...DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CRAP. BY THE TIME YOU WASTE YOUR MONEY ON GETTING THIS TO WORK, YOU CAN GET A PROFESSIONAL TO DO IT FOR YOU FOR LESS
I had to decide between this camera and a Panasonic.  we trust the Sony brand a little more, so we went with the Sony.  We were looking for an easy-to-use camera that we could just pick up and record our daughter...nothing professional but good enough quality to enjoy years later.  I also wanted a camera that could take still photos so we wouldn't need both a digital camera and a camcorder when we take vacations.   ---  --- Here's what I think so far: ---  --- Great camcorder to do exactly what we want -- picture looks great inside and out, VERY easy to use, and small enough to carry along almost anywhere.   ---  --- Still photos are not fantastic (only 3MP), but good enough for me.  Color and resolution are acceptable.     ---  --- Not easy to understand the LCD touch menus, but you can configure the buttons once you figure out which buttons you will use the most. ---  --- I got the bare minimums for accessories...bought a 1GB memory card (memory stick duo pro)...glad I did this since I will be taking stills and short video clips to email to the grandparents.  Also got a carrying case, DV tapes, and an extra NP-FP71 battery.  I'll be purchasing a firewire cable soon (I'm sure you've heard, the USB cable is inadequate for downloading video).   ---  --- Handycam station doesn't really bother me that much, but I can see what the fuss is about.   ---  --- All things considered, I'm extremely happy with my purchase.  I think this is a perfect camera for a first-time camcorder buyer who needs an EASY button (there's one on the side of the camera).  A little more expensive than some of the others, but the price is dropping.   ---  --- Best of luck!     
This device is made without varistors, which are burned up as they block transients and surges in power lines. Our AV system and HDTV are connected to it,  It has worked perfectly for the several months we have used it, blocking spikes in the power lines to expensive AV equipment
I've seen Tuners come and go, mostly at a high cost. I bought this to tune both of my guitars and my violin, and so far it hasn't let me down. I thought I had a good ear for tuning but this little gadget quickly corrected me and now my guitar sounds better than ever... Highly recommended
GREAT SCOPE has good zoom and works good for 22. and super 9 air guns. Note that its dovetail and not weaver though Great Scop
Are these journals a Five, or a Three? ---  --- These journals are truly something special.  With the nice, firm cover; lots of pages; a pocket; and elastic to keep them shut, they offer a ton of function for compulsive scribblers. ---  --- But...they demand a little flexibility from the journalist in return.  They don't handle all inks well, and in particular they handle very few fountain pen inks without significant bleed-through. ---  --- So if one commits to a Moleskine journal, one commits to a pen/ink combination that won't bleed--opening up both sides of the paper--or one resigns oneself to wasting the back half of each page. ---  --- For those willing to do a little research, though, the pen/ink combinations are out there (fountain pen users should look up Noodler's Black; for Gel roller users, Pilot's G2 refills also work splendidly with Moleskine).   ---  --- If you want a solid, utilitarian journal, it's tough to beat these, especially at a reasonable price--but the bleeding pages will require adjustments.  It's up to you
I am a user of Acronis backup and very satisfied with it and was hoping that the Disk Director would be the same however it is a little more complicated to use, I partitioned a drive then wanted to convert back and have not yet be able to do so, I know that you can but just haven't found out how yet, it could have been made a little more simplier to use
I have a hard time understanding what it is that I dislike about the novel. I dislike it almost as much as the movie. --- I have been a loyal follower of Smiley and some more after that. Once the Cold War was over, JlC had to look for a new realm. I tried to follow him, but gave up with the Kaukasian troubles, forgot the name of the book. --- Maybe it is this: JlC's trade mark, his USP, is the evilness of the other side. With the KGB & Co., that worked perfectly. His readers were willing to stay with him and believe him. --- Now he is transferring the KGB style to all sorts of other badies. I think it does not work any more. --- It is not that I trust the pharmaceutical companies enough to not be like here insinuated. I do not. --- What I do not like, I guess, is the artificial mood of intellectual suffering from the evilness of all kind of conspiracies. Tess in this story seems to be the normal do-gooder who falls foul with the baddies. That is more ok in the book than in the movie. (There, for my eyes, Rachel Weisz does herself discredit.) --- What is absolutely not ok is the surrender of command by the narrator mid way. JlC gives up on trying to keep a believable storyline and declines into darkest conspiracy allegations
impossible to get off after a good work out. just not for me
I am very disappointed with this product. --- The volume is not adjustable, and the default sound setting is so loud that it can be heard in another room, even with a door closed.  ---  --- Electronic toy voices are occasionally annoying or difficult to understand, this is the case here. So, needing to have something repeated... loudly... can "get on your nerves". ---  --- I will be more careful in the future and not assume that all speaking electronic toys come with adjustable volume. --- Buyers beware!
After going insane with the new version of Norton Systemworks 2005, which doesn't even install, I decided to finally swear off all Symantec products.  ---  --- I have used Zone Alarm Pro for some time. It's not perfect, but it certainly will protect your computer. I took the plunge and went with the full security suite this week, and I've been relatively happy. ---  --- On the plus side, the software works really well. The personal firewall is better than any you can find, and the virus protection found a phishing app that Norton had not (before I had unstalled it). ---  --- On the minus side, the firewall can be problematic. I've had page load issues on Ebay and on my own site which has a cgi script to keep my images and files from being hotlinked (bandwidth theft). When I visit my site or any other that has a similar anti-theft cgi script, the images simply won't come up. Ebay gets all messed up as well. I haven't been able to figure out a setting that works, so I have to turn off the firewall on Ebay and a few other sites, which kind of defeats the purpose of a firewall. This doesn't happen a lot though, so it's not annoying enough to get my dander up. ---  --- All in all it's been a far better investment than Symantec products, so despite its limitations I would recommend this program. It does have a lot of options to set, but they are pretty easy to get through if you are computer literate. ---  --- If you decide to go with this program and you currently have Norton Antivirus, you will need to uninstall Norton before this program will run. ---  --- If you were to ask me if I preferred Symantec Systemworks or Zone Alarm Security Suite, there would be absolutely no hesitation in recommending Zone Alarm. --- 
let me first say this, Roots is basically Paul Simon's Graceland, except nu-metalized. these guys went to south america, cut a couple of terrible tracks with "natives"?, then filled the rest of it out with generic nu-metal crapola with that guy from Korn cut and pasted into the mix for good measure. this is a particularily bad example of the vile and thank-you-god-in-heaven-it's-dead Nu-metal genre-meaningless pissed off lyrics, excessive "guesting" of other crappy artist, bad guitar, bad sitar(!), and the inclusion of anything to do with Korn, all presumabely done with band members sporting loinclothes and Rambo style striped face paint. the biggest waste of time, money, and matter. Its a shame that these guys are living and breathing and taking up space and resources that someone else could be using. A real bummer. 
Jane Fonda plays a washed up has been actress in this movie with a very bad drinking problem. She wakes up one morning next to a guy with a knife in his chest and she can't remember what happened the night before. Then she is on the run when she meets a sympathetic young man played by Jeff Bridges.Unlike Hitchcock movies when the violins start to screetch on the soundtrack then you knw something VERY BAD is going to happen. The violins in this movie play pretty loud but nothing happens. I figured out "Whodunnit" in the first 30 minutes of this film and then spent the next hour trying to figure out if Fonda's hair was a wig or did she get her own hair bleached blonde?I give this movie 5 stars because I liked the look of the loft where the dead guy lives
I gave this 5 stars only because it serves its purpose well. It's just a basic mouse pad, but the price is excellent!!
The greatest tasting syrup ever made. Excellent on toast, no other syrup can come close. Forty years ago I thought it was the greatest and it still is! I am having a hard time purchasing it in my province in Canada and it is worth the effort to order it on line. I wish they would expand their distribution
The compatibility with Nokia phones should not have to be listed because very clearly in BOLD letters-within the title-it says "Universal 2.5mm Jack"  Universal meaning ALL 2.5mm jacks. Not all cell phones.  Know your phone and your aquisition before giving a bad review.  Great product
No doubt about it, from start to finish, this is a classic for anybody's collection. I can remember back in the spring of '93 when the movie came out and it was a classic as well but the soundtrack matches up to what the movie was and this soundtrack sent a big message to a lot of us about what goes on the inner cities today. This was rap music at it's best from Spice 1 to DJ Quik. There will not be a soundtrack like this ever again that addresses what goes on in our neighborhoods. So add this to your collection if you still love the true gangster rap, west coast fan(like myself), or just want to hear a great soundtrack
I'm gonna quote a paragraph from the book, please note - in no way can this paragraph tell you anything about the book or spoil it for those who havent read it. ---  --- " A woman left at home would close her eyes and the power of her need would enable her to see her man on his ocean ship battling pirates with pistol, her man in the battle's fray with his sword and shield, standing victorious among corpses, her man in a desert whose sands were on fire, amid mountain peaks, drinking the driven snow. So long as he lived she would follow his journey, would feel his elation and his grief, and if he died a spear of love would fly back across the world to pierce her waiting omniscient heart. It would be the same for him. IN the midst of desert's fire he would feel her cool hand on his cheek and in the heat of battle she would murmur the words of love into his ear : live, live. That was what the stories said about love. That was what human beings knew love to be." ---  --- Shalimar the Clown was about as good as I thought it would be. It definitely isn't the best book I've read this year but I must say Salman Rushdie's writing style captivates me nonetheless. In between the most relevant paragraphs, he says things that are unique and have a true stronghold on the reader's mindset. In this book, he mentions a quote, twice, which really caught my eye. "One doesn't know the questions of life until one is asked" ---  --- Another thing I noticed about the book is that the central character, Shalimar, is seldom mentioned. The book seems to hover around other dozen characters. Only in prison and in that one letter sent back to Kashmira does Shalimar's true character really come out. The second quarter of the book got immensely boring and I really despise how Max's character was written about. It was annoying, difficult to read, over-detailed and excruciating to read. ---  --- Boonyi was an outstanding character. So was the old witch and Boonyi's father. When Colonel Tortoise was mentioned in the book, I thought his character would prove of some consequence but nothing about yielded anything. One couldn't help but dislike Max's lack of integrity. Mythology is rather well written about in this book. Every 50 pages, a one page something would be mentioned including just the right amount of detail and words. ---  --- Conclusion - ---  --- While reading,time and again I would rage on to my friend about how superb the writer's grasp on the reader is. The writer knows his words,where to use them, he knows that he has a prodigious way of writing and he employed them better than ever. Maybe this book disappointed his core fans. Maybe it LACKED A SPARK enough to obilerate doubt. ---  --- All in all, I can say that Salman Rushdie has a wierd way of his own. His vocabulary is truly astounding. Maybe he is the most "learned" writer I've ever read, if not the best. Respect.  ---  ---  --- H.S Anand --- -17th October'06 12.13P
  After purchasing the program thinking it would perform a through check on my Presario running XP Home all I get is a message that SSP6 has unexpectedly quite. I emailed tech support w/ the info, but so far no response after 10 days. There is no # to call for support. Maybe I overlooked something.  ---   Also, I submitted the rebate form which came on the package, but was told that the seller was not participating in the rebate program and I need to check w/ them. I did and they said they shipped what VCOM had provided them, which included a rebate form if doing a competitive upgrade. ---   Not very impressed w/ either the software or the company. Would never buy another product from these guys, even when the price after rebate is 0. LOF
I suggest watching the original version: Sword of Doom - which is amazing. A lot less acid is involved, and less cliche. Izo is a rent, at best
I own a lot of strollers for my twin sons ((this one, the duoglider, two small single strollers, and a double umbrella stroller)) and I absolutely LOVE this one! ---  --- First of all, if you want to be a satisfied customer you have to know what the purpose of the stroller is, which is for jogging, or maneuvering outdoors on rough terrain. My husband jogs with the stroller at least once a week ((and has no complaints)), but I on the other hand just adore it for the outdoors. The wheels go over almost any surface, including gravel, dirt, grass, concrete, brick, sand, boardwalk anything, I love it. The seats both fully recline ((individually)) and when they do, the rear of the seat is mesh so you can see your child from behind ((although you would most-likely have to bend down to get a good look)). The five-point harness on a jogger is a MUST HAVE, and this model even comes with comfortable pads as well. The basket is HUGE and holds everything we need for a day at the beach/park/walk around the block, which is very important to me. It is also removable, but I don't see why it would be advantageous to take it off. Plenty of other storage is available behind the seats as well, handy little pockets and pouches to store little knick-knacks. Considering the type of stroller it is, it folds very easily, and I can fit it in the rear of my minivan after removing the rear and front tires ((which is equally as easy to do, rear tires come off with the push of a button and the front has an easy to use release mechanism)). The canopy is enormous and proves for GREAT sun protection when needed! The breaks are FANTASTIC, and stop the stroller in its tracks which is very important if you are jogging, and need to stop quickly, according to my husband anyway. The included wind/rain shield is also very convenient ((can be left rolled up to the top of the canopy, incase there is a chance of rain you don't have to work for 5 minutes to attach it and get the kiddos wet)), but I do wish it also came with mesh covers for mosquitos and other bugs. ---  --- I do dislike the fact that it is EXTREMELY difficult to turn ((although I have kind of gotten it down to a science, you need to be prepared for the turn and tilt the stroller a bit, the turn is very wide and not that smooth)). I think it would be better if it had a swivel wheel which had the option to lock in place for jogging ((a swivel wheel would actually be extremely dangerous if jogging as you could lose control of the stroller)), but that's just me personally. The baskets are near impossible to access if both seats are reclined all the way, and I have had to wake sleeping babies on a few occasions ((that's why I have learned to put things such as my cell phone and wallet in the canopy pouches, so I don't have to constantly go into the basket)). The canopy is quite large, and if you are not using it its quite a pain to retract as it doesn't go back neatly, and if its a windy day the canopy doesn't always stay up. ---  --- If you are looking for a good stroller for outdoor use, and don't mind the large size or getting used to turning, then I highly recommend the Tike Tech
The front material is cheap feeling and grainy.  Also, there is a large plastic gold-colored Cris Notti button adorning the front that does not appear in the online picture.  Otherwise it is functionally useful and of good quality
this baby gate is ideal for the size and price.  i had shopped tons of stores and websites before i had found this gate.  the hardware mount, eye hooks, are not the sturdiest, but this gate definately gets the job done
Sometimes the National Enquirer is the only place to find the true story about a subject - for example it broke the story about O. J.'s shoes. I guess you have to pick and choose your articles. Some of the articles, I admit, are useless. However, other articles are interesting and some you can't find anyplace else
The product doesnt appear as is shown on the picture at all. Its not Red and its too small to even imagine.I knew it would appear bit smaller than on picture but this is beyond my imagination.The chain can break any time!!! And the stud!!!!!!!gosh...i cant even see it! Now i'm gonna check if its really gold or not!! --- DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT!SAVE YOURSELF THE MONEY
I  bought this swing for our first child specially because it has many features.....overall I am happy with it and our son seems to enjoy it....but few things I wish it had is ....one that the seat could be reclined and two is that the toys made some kind of noise to get attention.Overall for the price it is good
Our 21-month old daughter has been using this tub since birth and we love it!  It does hold water and she can splash around and play with her toys.  The sunctions are great since they do stick pretty good to the tub.  Easy to clean and easy to put away when my husband or I need to use our regular tub
I was about to buy an escape hammer when I spotted this Keychain Rescue Tool. I like that it is small enough to store close to the driver's seat. Fortunately, I have not had the need to use it
i bought this thinking that this would be fun and a decent workout, i tried it a few times but just couldnt get in to it. it go's a bit fast but i know i could get used to it, but they have very big steps and they lung into it and i think it would be better if they work up to it i kept finding myself rewinding it to do the step corretly i dont realy strive for perfection i just want to do it some what right. there are better ones out there than this, but i think i am going to try it again cuz it wasnt so bad that i am going to quit it
Radica used to amke good hand held electronic games; this was is cheap. Buttons need to be pressed unusually hard to respond.  dark screen that lights up only when the room is nearly pitch black
Excellent service, ontime delivery, perfect match for my grill.  Thanks for the detailed descriptions and pictures of the products you sell. 
except for the nifty little metal clips that keep the strap at the length you set until you press on it to lengthen/shorten the strap again. Does exactly what it is supposed to do, and makes for challenging exercises due to the inherent instability. Great for spotting oneself too. I would buy it again, tho I don't think it is as indispensible as some might have you believe. So if you can burn the $35 or so, get it with no fear. Otherwise, use your frustration to fuel your desire to workout
I have used this product for the past 16 years. It is wonderful!The Super Double Face Powder is actually a foundation and matte powder all rolled into one product. The product comes with an application sponge, goes on dry, gives superb coverage! I don't even use my Clinique concelar when I wear this product, it is that good! This product works best with those individuals who have normal or combination skin.
Ingredients: High Fructose Corn Syrup and Hydrogenated Oil.  --- Do a search and see what you think. I won't touch this stuff.
This is an awesome set!!  My husband and I use it all the time.  It looks great and can really take a beating
Simply put, Xenogears + Xenosaga 1 & is the absolute best storyline, and best role playing experience on the PS2 to date. --- I do strongly believe that Xenosaga 2 has the best storyline in any RPG I have ever, ever played, including Final Fantasy 7, Xenogears, and hundreds of others. Because RPGs are strongly reliant on storyline for gameplay, I consider this to be the pinnacle of Role Playing on the PS2. Final Fantasy X comes close, as does Star Ocean, but in terms of storyline, this game beats them. --- However, I did have to mark down for a few other minor flaws. This game is highly a niche game, only for those who enjoy the style, and the sci fi setting. It's also very short.....20 hours if you play straight through (no leveling up). Maybe 38-42 hours if you take up the side-quests and want a strong character. ---  --- Gameplay: The first Xenosaga highly relied on cut scenes and narrative. In fact, I absolutely could not stand the battle system. Xenosaga Episode 2 still relies heavily upon that storytelling through hours of cut scenes, but it fixes the battle system. ---  --- The battle system is, simply put, one of the most fun turn-based systems I have ever experienced. While Xenosaga Episode 1's battle system seemed slow and unwieldy, Episode 2 has a fast paced, action packed, and highly challenging battle system. ---  --- You have 3 characters on the screen at just about all times, these characters can be switched off in a manner much like FFX, but it costs a turn in this game, causing it to be more tactical. ---  --- Each turn you have many options; you can attack (more on various attacks later), stock (save a turn for the next turn in order to get a combo), use ether (read: magic), or change your battle party. ---  --- If you choose to attack, there is a whole slew of options here as well. Most importantly is learning the weak points of the enemy. Every enemy, including bosses, have a certain attack combination that will be most effective against them. When you attack, you can press either square, which is a B zone attack, Triangle, which is a C zone attack, or circle, which is another B zone attack. Certain characters also have an A zone attack, but this is only against flying opponents. You must expierament with the enemies in order to learn the zones they are weakest in. Sometimes, you may be required to 'stock' for a turn in order to attack the enemy in its weak zone. ---  --- "What is the advantage of attacking weak zones?" you ask. Well, it allows for large scale, damage pounding comboes that are absolutely essential in this game. Once you have hit all of the enemy's weak zones, you can do a "break" on them. This involves the circle button. Once a character is 'broken', they can be tossed into the air, or attacked while prone on the ground. This can add up to tons of damage if you plan your boosting right. ---  --- Boosting is another integral part of the combat system. Pressing the R1 button brings up a 3 slot meter which is sometimes empty, but it may feature the character potraits of some of your characters. If you press R1, and then the button (square, triangle, or circle) that that character's potrait is on, they will boost forward, and immediately after the acting unit has taken its turn, this new character will have a turn. ---  --- Enemies, however, can take advantage of all of these systems as well. If you do not plan well, or randomly attack without comboes, the enemy will break you, boost ahead several times, and can easily destroy one of your characters in one short, brutal assault. Countless times my entire party was destroyed by simple enemies that should have been no problem, merely because I did not plan ahead. You will get very, very used to seeing the game over screen. The plus side of this difficulty is that you feel real exhiliration when you win, it is a great accomplishment. Note that even with power levelling, it won't help you much in some situations, believe me, I tried. ---  --- Finally, there is Ether. Ether skills are basically magic, if you know anything about RPGs at all, then you know basically what is present here, healing ether skills, attack ether skills, nothing big. ---  --- I forgot to mention the E.S. units. These are basically mechs, and were called A.G.W.S. in Episode 1. Many points in the game involve you using these to move around and fight, and now they have an independant battle system. It's basically the same as the one with your characters on screen, except that you only have one attack a turn, no comboes or anything like that. It is just an added piece of fun to an already awesome game. ---  --- There is a skill system in place. After every battle you earn class pointss and/or skill points. These can be spent on getting new ether skills, or new upgrades to your characters that can make them more resilient when you equip them. Every character has the same skill set, and this is a minor flaw that slightly brings down the gameplay score, but not the overall enjoyment in the least. ---  --- Finally, one other flaw with the gameplay is that there are no weapons, and no armor. Both of these are RPG standard fare, and it seems kind of odd to not have either. This may just be something the developers decided not to do that I disagree with, but it still seems a little odd. Note that this really does not detract from the game in any way. ---  --- In Xenosaga 2, they also opted to add a lot more puzzle solving than episode 1 had. The interesting thing is that these puzzles, while challenging, don't take away from the gameplay expierience at all. In fact, I found many to be very enjoyable. ---  --- The storyline of this game is simply incredible. But, keep in mind that it is basically required that you have beaten Xenosaga episode 1 if you want to understand it at all, or at least be acquainted with the story in some manner. If you haven't played it, the best way is to get the bonus DVD that came with the game, there are probably some somewhere around, maybe even on ebay, that allows you to see 4 hours of cut scenes from the original. This can substitute in for those who dont want to spend the 60-80 hours required on Xenosaga episode 1 to beat it. ---  --- Anyway, I digress, Xenosaga 2's storyline is more of the space opera fun. Often times I got very emotional, and the game can tug on your heartstrings. In the ending sequence of the game, a spectacular event lasting about 15 minutes, I was seriously in tears. This game can do that to you, the storyline is that good. It is also filled with entrigue, betrayal, new discoveries, and new secrets. It is truly incredible. I have seen certain reviews that say the storyline doesn't solve everything, it doesn't solve all the mysteries. Let me tell you something: it's not supposed to. Xenosaga is going to be a 4-8 part series, and the storyline is continuous. It makes no sense at all to have the story be complete in only episode II. I see no reason why anyone could possibly complain about it. ---  --- Graphics: The graphics of Xenosaga 2 are basically the same as they were in episode 1. No real improvements at all. They are still great though, and the cut scenes are gorgeous. My one real complaint here is that the lip sync is sometimes off (a problem with just about every RPG with voice overs), and some of the environments are a little dull. This is made up for in the environments that are simply breathtaking. ---  --- Sound: The soundtrack of Xenosaga Episode 2 is godlike. From the opening theme to the battle music to the catchy Japanese sounding tunes that ring in your head forever, this music is INCREDIBLE. The voice acting is also absolutely superb, I have zero complaints, this is a rarity. Sound effects are also very appropriate, and very well done. ---  --- Value: The game is hurt in the value department only because of its length. To put it in perspective, the first playthrough took me about 28 hours, but more like 30 if you count all the times I died and had to go back to the point I got killed at. After you win, you can use your game clear file to access even more goodies like some bonus bosses, dungeons, and side quests, and this helps make up for the shorter length. Personally, I think its the best $50 I have ever spent. ---  --- Tilt: Finally, the overall enjoyment. This game is simply the most enjoyable game I have played on the PS2. I completed it after several all-night gaming sessions, and it will most likely keep you up too. The Role Playing experience here is superb, the storyline is possibly the best in RPG history, and the battle system is incredible and in depth. There is virtually nothing not to like. As an avid RPG gamer, I recommend this game as highly as is possible. However, there are a few things to consider: can you handle the challenge, and do you like the Space Opera/Anime feel? If you answered yes to both, get this game
I waited and waited for an order from JD foods to come for a Xmas gift.  Even received a notice that the order was placed and correct...only to find out through my OWN efforts that the product was discontinued.  Bad communication.  Will not make that mistake again
The color tabs really help you know what section to look at. The only disadvantages of this field guide are that it doesn't document every species in North America and that the new National Geographic Field Guide to the Birds of North America, Fifth Edition has the Blue Grouse split into the Sooty and Dusky Grouse making it more up to date!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  ---  --- Still, this field guide has many good things.
Okay, I am new to the world of stargazing.  I purchased this telescope based on recommendations here at Amazon.com.  I have been completely satisfied.  I am especially impressed with the clear, crisp viewing of the moon.  I can see a few planets, but they are of course very small through the eyepiece. ---  --- I do have a suggestion to anyone who may purchase this telescope.  Take your time putting it together.  Read all the directions first.  Pay special attention to the details concerning the Collimator.  If you don't know what that is, you need to.  I almsot made some major mistakes, screwing and unscrewing parts that needed to be left alone.   ---  --- If you pay attention to all of the details on the instructions, you will have the telescope together in a couple of hours and be well on your way to enjoying yourself, especially on a clear night. ---  --- The package containing my telescope arrived in four days and was completely intact.  I couldn't be happier with my purchase.  I am sure a more avid sky-watcher might want a little something more, but for the once-in-a-while gazer, this is the telescope. ---  --- See ya next review. ---  --- 
Esquire may be a man's magazine, but I enjoy the articles as a woman, because it is no holes barred feedback with the rough edges included. I got my first issue a couple weeks back, and found it funny, informative, great pic of Tom Petty, and I'm looking forward to more issues
I bought these inexpensive zills for my students to use in class, as I was running low on loaners. Of course, I wasn't expecting top quality instruments, but they are just great for students to use in class while they're learning -- and still leave the student some motivation to buy a personal set of high-quality zills! They came in individual zip-lock bags, and even included tiny safety pins.  ---  --- Perfect for teachers buying for a whole classroom
  The classic Final Fantasy games (1-3 [not 6]) are NOTORIOUS for their difficulty.  This does not hold true until you reach the center of the moon.   Then, you will find yourself guzzling Elixirs, Potions, and Ethers just to kill ONE monster.  For example, the Behemoths (found past B5 in the center of the moon, and in Bahamuts cave) will counter every spell and attack with a brutal 2300 hit on one party member.  Most of the boss fights (Asura, Bahamut) and tough monsters (Behemoths, Wicked Masks) are gimmick fights.  Bahamut is actually one of the easiest fights in the game, just cast Reflect on all of your party members. ---   Let me reinstate what the previous reviewers have said about this game --- + Crisp graphics --- + Great music + sound --- + Fun --- + More to do once you beat the game --- - Somewhat short (beat EG Zeromus in 18hrs 42mins) --- - Very difficult --- - Prepare to grind 10-15 levels once you reach the center of the moon! ---  --- I enjoyed this, and you can bet I'm getting FF3 for the DS.  Great blast from the past, a must-buy for any Final Fantasy fan, RPG lover, or GBA owner

Compared to my logitech mouseman dual optical from 2000, this mouse blows it away by far in accuracy, precision.  What I find to be a drawback is the mouse's light weight and small size.  The size comes in handy if I need to flick, but be sure to keep the wire out of the way - as the mouse is so light if you have the wire in a bad spot, it will push the mouse and affect your aim at crucial moments. The "change sensitivity" button is in a strange spot (at least if u have large hands) located in the center of the mouse where you will need to reach far back and almost touch the pad of your palm of the finger you're reaching with - not an efficient movement, therefore not applicable in games (you can assign a sensitivity script to perhaps one of the side mouse buttons if necessary).  These are only minor itches when compared to the outstanding precision and I would highly recommend it
Would highly recommend this product -- I've bought it for friends even, to show them that granola could be this wonderful.  I've tried the Flax Plus also, but it wasn't as good as the Hemp Plus.  I would also recommend the bar form of this product, which doesn't seem to be on Amazon currently and is a bit pricy in stores
Once we took this net out of the box I knew it wouldn't work. Our balcony railing was not only longer, but shorter in height, than the net so we had to wrap it around the top railing. The "strings" used to secure the net did not look strong enough to me and the whole set up looked ridiculous. I am searching for an alternative
I was dying to get my hands on these after reading such wonderful endorsements.  I had nothing but high hopes.  I was totally open minded.  I thought it seemed too good to be true (low cal no carb noodles!) but hey, I'm an optimist.  Guess what? It is too good to be true!  I read about washing them and drying them.  I did.  No problem.  I added sauce.  I put them in my mouth.  The taste was not the problem it was the texture.  It was seriously like chewing rubber bands.  No noodle resemblence whatsoever.  I honestly can't understand those who rave about these, but, hey, to each his own
Great taste, excellent spicy flavor (with or without meat added).  One of the best dried packaged soups ever
I've subscripted to Gourmet for years but I let my subscription run out.  The lifestyle articles keep pushing out the recipies.  As I read through food magazines I dog-ear the page with a recipe I want to try.  In the last year there were very few dog-eared pages and it wasn't worth continuing the subscription
This is now on clearance at Target... $199.99.  They're going fast, I hid one in a display wooden chest in the furniture department til it drops even lower
I bought this as a gift for my 81 year old mother, who is impossible to please.  She needed a new card shuffler, as she wasn't pleased with her plastic, battery operated one.  I must admit, I thoroughly expected to have to return it, since I knew she wouldn't be pleased with it.  As it turns out, I did have to return it, but here's the surprise.  I was very disappointed in its performance too!  We could not get it to shuffle cards, whether they be from a new deck, or an old, worn out, dog eared deck.  Moral of this story -- please don't buy this item, whether you're difficult to please or not
I don't have twins, however I have an infant and a toddler and it works --- great for them. I go jogging every morning with the kids and  --- it is the most comfortable stroller I have used yet.  --- Thank you!!
Tinkyada makes the BEST brown rice pasta!  My kids eat it with just butter and shaved parmesan and never notice that it's not regular semolina pasta.  With a hearty meat sauce, my husband can't even tell the difference.  Definitely recommended
This watch is totally accurate. And with glow in the dark hands and numerals and an oversized date window, it is the perfect watch. It makes it a pleasure to look at my wrist
These JavoScreen Treo 650 protectors are really very different from anything you've normally seen.  Typically, 95% of the screen protectors are that very thin material that you stick on the screen, hope against hope that you don't have bubbles, but you almost always do. When the screen is off, you see the bubbles, thankfully when the screen is on, the bubbles are pretty invisible..... BUT these JavoScreen protectors are a completely different animal.  They are thick, and tough, and relatively firm.  And because of those properties, they go on with NO bubbles, and they are easily moveable (adjustable) should you not get it on perfectly the first time.  Further, they come with a little squeegee thingy to make sure its on there good.  This is the state of the art for screen protectors.  And this all becomes an even bigger issue for men, because of whiskers, over time the screen will get dulled and scratched.  Because of the thickness and quality of these, scratches to the screen are no longer an issue.
When I first came to Iran, black clad women all seemed the same. Scary unsmiling servants of the Ayatollas ---  --- Having visited the Islamic Republic of Iran in June, I was better prepared for that vast country portrayed by Elaine Sciolino in her book Persian Mirrors. I am more than grateful for this book, which alerted me to the diversity of cultures, and the general way of life so absolutely different from the Western world. --- Elaine Sciolino made me so very aware of the perfect social world of the Iranians and also I am thrilled to say that once you make a friend of an Iranian, you have a friend for life. --- My most treasured memories of Iran will never leave me and I thank Ms Sciolino for preparing me for that journey.  --- Reviewed by Heather Marshall Negahdar (SUGAR-CANE 11/10/05)
Being a fan of Jack Johnson, I thought this one would be as good as the others.  I wasn't impressed at all.  It sounds like a few guys pickin' around in the basement.  The recording quality has very little production value.  At best, these are okay live versions of usually great songs.  This is an unnecessary piece for your Jack Johnson collection.
I purchased your "Space Saver Highchair" for my 9 month old daughter who is severely disabled. Finding equipment for the very young disabled child is very difficult.  This chair works for everything!  This chair is so comforatable for my daughter and allows her to sit up and play with her toys as she gets very bored laying on her back all day.  She also has a very difficult time playing with her toys as her grasp is not well controlled and she is constantly dropping toys on her face or off to the side and cannot get them back in her hand. I love this chair for its size, the way the whole seat tilts (not just the back), and the 5 point harness.  The chair is also small so it holds her very nicely.  My daughter loves nothing more than to sit in this chair all the time
It was broken in a few days of use, you should buy a hard cover instea
I bougt this camera because I had had a Sony Coolpix 3, which took great pictures.  With this camera, you can never get it adjusted right.  If you use the flash the  pictures are to light, if you dont they are too dark.  It is a constant battle with this little cute camera. Worse camera purchase I ever made.
This UV filter does it job to protect the lens well. The build is solid (metal construction). The glass is also descent quality.  ---  --- About the performance, it absorbs some UV light. The UV light absorbtion is hardly noticeable, probably the sky 1-A and the haze filter version will absorb more UV light than this lens which is fine for me.  ---  --- Now, about the one problem which is the internal reflection. I've heard many people say that it mostly happens during night or low light shooting. I found out that it is not caused directly by the low light/night situation. The internal reflection will appear when there is a strong/bright source of light in comparison to the overall exposure (the surrounding environment). To put it in example (which hopefully is easier to understand), when you take a picture of a lamp during nightime and the light is much brighter than the surrounding area then you will see the internal reflection. as you move the position of the light to be closer to the sides/corner of the picture (and not in the center of the picture), the internal reflection reduces and finally dissapear (if you move the light far enough from the center). And if the light isn't too bright/contrast compare to the surrounding environment then there will be no internal reflection. but of course most of the time, a lamp at nightime is often very bright. But the point that I'm trying to make is that the internal reflection doesn't happen all the time during low light or night time.  ---  --- Additionally, the internal reflection isn't only happening at night. it can also happen in the afternoon if you are taking a picture of a sun for example. basically same rule as above, on how bright is the light source compared to the surrounding area, and as you move the sun from the center of the photo and near the side the internal reflection will move to the side/dissapear (also depending the angle). But the best way is just to remove the filter during these situations.  ---  --- Hope this explanation helps you to reduce the occurence of internal reflection by identifying correctly when the internal reflection will occur and then remove the filter during those situation (which is not hard to do).  ---  --- I'm actually not a fan of lens filter (any filter) as I think it will only degrade picture quality as we added another layer between the sensor and object, but I decided to use them anyway for all my lens. And I would recommend everyone to get one of this filter if you don't have any filter for your lens yet. 
Without a doubt this is the best product of its type, I looked at several others priced significantly higher, and after setting up the AM2 it was clear I had made the best choice
Painting the plates is a fun activity because you can be creative. The only problem is that you have to be careful or they could crack or break
This film is visually stunning and impressive, and has talented and credible actors.   ---  --- Unfortunately, there is barely a story with a lot of poorly-developed characters who are "trained"/brainwashed and instructed in the ways of death and inhumanity.   ---  --- The settings and group "sermons" from Nazi officials are striking and convincing, but there is nothing that ties it all together.  Our hero fails to strike the "killer blow" and is stripped, literally and figuratively, of all status and walks away.  The end. ---  --- I'm forced to comment that this is marketed as a gay film, and I was surprised by how un-gay it was.  In fact, the two boy "friends" work together at one point to spy on a lady in a state of undress.  It's more about a childhood relationship in the midst of chaos than anything else.  ---  --- I have issues with some of the pacing as well.  I found myself pressing the fast forward button several times, and didn't really seem to miss much.  Not a good sign. ---  --- So, for what it is, it's okay.  Certainly not a masterpiece, and certainly not something to run out and buy. 
Excellent watch at a great price.  The teal color is absolutely beautiful and I love the style.  I have several Fossil watches and no complaints.  They are easily adjustable, water resisant, and polish up nicely to look like new again
Finally a cute pink car seat.  It is duralble and easy to lift around. I wish they had this cute color for my other daughter.  Ihave not deliverd yet so I don't know how she will fit in it,  But I also have the stroller and everyone who sees the matching combo tells me how cute it is.  There is not any other pink combo out there.  I just hope it works as well as it shows off
Canon's BG-E3 battery grip is one awesome extra you cannot be without.  I found the extra weight and size NOT to be even a minor burden.   I rec'd product 2 days after initial receiving date/17th St Photo did a fantastic job (once again)
A friend of mine has Zombies!!!, also by Twilight Creations.  I've played it a few times, and found it pretty enjoyable.   ---  --- Zombietown is sort of a followup to this in some ways, and tries to expand the strategy of the game somewhat. ---  --- Unfortunately, it ends up far too confusing and complicated to make for fast gameplay (it's often very slow, in fact), and the strategy is more shallow than Risk.   ---  --- Ya know the stereotypically confusing instructions of insert Tab A into Slot B?  That's pretty much what the instructions to this read like.  They're fairly poorly written to boot.  There were also a couple problems we ran into the rules didn't seem to cover.  I can't recall them off the top of my head, and they didn't come up very often, but it was still irritating. ---  --- Overall, definetly not reccomended.  At $40 in stores, and $35 off Amazon, it's also a HUGE ripoff.  What do you get in the box?  Like 100 tiny army men-esque figures, a couple of packs of cards, and a laminated piece of cardboard.  I understand why it is expensive, as I'm sure this was a low budget item and such, but Zombies!!! was much less expensive. 
Dont buy it from Andrew Christian, i wrote them online several times and never, not once, got an answer from them, i ended up buying them some other place
This was a gift for my 17 year old daughter and she absolutely loves it and wears all the time!!!! I am seriously thinking of getting myself one
Cajun Cuisine is, without a doubt, the best Cajun cookbook that I've ever used.  I was born and reared in Southern Louisiana, and the recipes detailed within closely mirror the exact techniques, seasonings, and spices  that I had learned by watching both my grandmothers in their kitchens, and  how I was personally taught by my grandfather at his hunting camp.  You  CANNOT go wrong with this book!                                    Jacque
I love this blanket so much let me count the ways...(1) certified organic (so hard to find), (2) large enough for a good, tight swaddle (for a good night sleep), (3) darling drawing showing how to swaddle baby sewn to blanket (even my husband can now swaddle like a nurse), (4) soft, soft, and softer with every wash! I just love this blanket and I feel so good wrapping my little bundle in the ULTIMATE - and I know he loves it too
my kids love this it fades right into the next color they fall right to sleep watching it change its an awesome light i was very pleased and its not to bright like some light up the room its just perfect mom of a 3 and 5 yr old !!
The jock has good support but the material used is quite abrasive. The elastic and threads bite into your skin. If you use this one for sports, you will constantly be distracted. The feel of the material used is very rough against your skin, esp at the waist
This is the perfect monitor for the average person.  The chest strap communicates with the machines at my gym so I don't have to look at the watch while using the machines.  While walking or jogging the watch provides a quick way to know your heart rate.  I haven't used the other features that are offered so I can't rate them, but it does everything that I wanted out of it when I purchased it
This isn't a consistent product. 99% of the time, I can't get it to work. After MONTHS of emails and phone calls, customer service responded. What a joke! They told me the plug in the unit and then unplug, wait 30 seconds, and then plug in. Gimme a break! I shouldn't have to do the Hokie Pokie just to get it to work. By the way, their process didn't work. Poor product, Poor customer service, Poor price

The umbrella I ordered is fine, just what I had hoped it would be. However, I subsequently ordered an umbrella stand (after you prompted me to do so) and when it arrived the two tightening screws  in the shaft had been damaged in shipment. Each of the screws have plastic knobs and the knobs were broken off. As a result when one tightens them the broken plastic is sharp enough to cut skin. I have tried unsuccessfully to find replacements at a hardware store.  Any suggestions
I am not at all happy with this product. The instructions are terrible and the program is not at all intuitive. It was a total waste of my money and time.
I have been aware of NaturallySpeaking for over 15 years.  We initially utilized this software to assist people with severe disabilities such as cerebral palsy to be able to have basic commands understood.  More recently five years ago I bought edition 4.0.  I found it to be frustrating when ever there was any background noise so I basically quit using it.  When I saw the 8.0 being advertised as the voice recognition software specifically for a small business atmosphere, I thought I would try it one more time.  Being a slow typist it has truly changed my life for the better.  Only 45 minutes were required to set up the speech-recognition files when the occasional mistakes occur during dictation if you correct those and change those right at that time, I never see that same misunderstanding happening again.  I have recommended it to two friends who are buying it.  It really does allow you to sit back in your chair relax, drink your coffee and dictate reports, answer e-mail or whenever it is you might need to do.  I can't think of any $70 expenditure that has given me so much back in such a short time.  I almost always have my headset on when I'm in front of the computer because anything that involves typing or entering data I used the DragonDictate to do
My first pregnancy I tried several styles of belts, most of which had a wide band in back. I am short, have a short midriff, and am overweight, so wider belts would roll from the top down.  I never had that problem with this belt.  Unfortunately, this pregnancy I am entering my 3rd trimester and have finally out grown the 1X belt, and the store I purchased it from is now closed.  I was thrilled when I found this on Amazon.com in a larger size.   ---  --- I recommend making it little snug in the mornings and then loosening it throughout the day as needed.  The most appealing feature for me is that this band is completely adjustable to give you the support you need for the different activities you will be doing throughout the day.  Any time you start needing the extra support, just slightly tighten the side straps.  When you start relaxing or if the belt starts feeling a little tight, just loosen it up a bit.  It's quick and easy to work with, and if one side needs more support than the other, just make that one side a bit more snug.  It's AWESOME! ---  --- I am a technology education specialist, so I'm on my feet for, many times, 16 hrs a day training and supporting hospitals with their new computer programs.  I couldn't have survived even my First Trimester without this belt.  I raise it a little higher in the back so that I have complete lower back support and belly support.  There were days when I forgot to wear my belt that I almost couldn't walk after only 4 hrs of work due to lower back pain that would eventually extend down to my fanny and legs.  My legs would litterally give out from underneath me until I could rub and relax my lower back for a while.  When you are working with doctors in the surgery room or doing rounds with them this is NOT a good thing.  As long as I wore my belt, I NEVER had a problem.   ---  --- I strongly recommend this product
My husband and I were introduced to Market Spice Tea in 1984 while we were living for a few months in Seattle.  We loved it and, upon our return to Jamesville, NY, begain to regularly order it.  Many of our friends now order it, too.  It is an ideal hot drink in the winter and equally good iced in the summer.  23 years and counting it is still our favorite tea
I have an older version of this charger that I bought in the mid 90's. I used it to maintain my garaged Mustang's battery over the winter months for many years. I made a cigarette lighter adapter so all I needed to do was to plug it in instead of using the alligator clips. I have to say this thing is dead reliable! It always kept my battery in prime condition. I love it and recommend it highly. 
My daughter is almost 6 and we got her this for Christmas.  The commercials made it look really cool and easy for kids, no more scissors!  Well we opened it today and it's too hard for her to hold the button down for any amount of time and to move it around slowly enough to actually cut anything.  I'm having to do it all for her and my hand gets tired too!  They should have made it that the "pen" cuts when just being pushed on the paper or something.  I have a 9 year old also that was trying to use it and it wasn't all that easy for him either.  Seems more like something teens or adults that scrapbook would use
Great improvements over the original DVD. Enhanced for 16x9 TVs with scenes that are now clearer and actually 2.35:1 widescreen ratio.  The original dvd claims an aspect ratio of "approximately 2.35:1" which was not true. I own both versions and have compared viewing aspects  of each. Clearly this DVD is far superior and well worth the purchase price.  This plays very well on my HDTV monitor; I'll give the old version to someone w/ an old 4x3 TV. 
The S9000 fits perfectly in the case. Too bad the case has no strap and no belt loop. Apparently, the camera strap is supposed to function as the case strap also. Too bad the camera strap is extremely short, made for very small people. So, instead of returning it and using a generic case that would not protectthe camera as well, I will adapt the case to work for me. I will get a bigger aftermarket strap for the camera. I can take the case to my seamstress and have a belt loop sewn on. It will work but only after extensive modification. Great camera design so it's odd that the case appears to have been designed by someone who has never used a camera before
I got this a few years back, and it is a very important member of our household still! My wrist was smashed in an auto accident many years ago and i no longer have the ability to hold free weight above my neck... the possibilities are atrocious. With the bowflex if i let go for any reason the potential catastrophe is avoided. ---  --- There is no stress or strain except for the muscle group you are trying to focus upon. Well made, well designed, and very well built. Like our Dyson vacuum, this is a quality product utilizing quality engineering. It may be perfect for the elderly or female/male non bodybuilder athlete because of it's non need for a spotter and the ease of changing resistance! ---  --- I am happy with my build, i don't want to be bodybuilder, if you do this may not be the correct machine for you... like it is for me at 43! ---  --- that is my opinion, and like all the others... i'm sticking to it! ---  --- thank you for your tim

I did a lot of looking before purchassing a Krusell, and opted to pay a little bit more for a product that appeared to be top notch.  It was a great investment.  The Krusell case holds the Blackberry securely and yet maintains easy use.  Cosemetically, it looks great with professional attire or with casual clothing!  The pockets inside work great for holding credit cards or business cards!  This is an excellent product
Extremely difficult to unistall. Endless loop. Do NOT buy this product or if you do then be prepared for an exremely fustrating experience. I will never use NAV again
      This book, "The Relatives Came" by Cynthia Rylant and illustrated by Stephen Gammell, was a delight to read. I found myself smiling as I read the words that made the artwork come alive. Likewise, I found myself recollecting over the memories of the past when my relatives would come to visit. And, I felt as if I, too, were a part of this book. Having experienced growing up in a small town where you don`t see that many people, I believe that when relatives come to visit, it almost seems like Christmas. As a result, when the book expressed the joy, laughter, and celebration of family, it stirred up these memories of the past. Unquestionably, almost anyone, from children to adults, could find themselves reminiscing and longing for the fun they had when their relatives come to visit.
Terribly waxy chocolate pieces that all sunk to the bottom of the bowl while the flakes floated on top.  The flakes seem to have a chocolate flavoring added to enhance the experience but those disgusting chocolate pieces made me gag and I wondered what I was eating...!

Don't get me wrong these are nice high end shoes, however, I was sent an ugly red color instead of the yellow displayed on the products site. Nowhere on the products site was the (red) "Outdoor Plein Air" color shown as a choice
My ONLY gripe with this magazine is that the pictures are like those you would find in GQ magazine: they hire models to show you driving a nail or shoveling dirt for that new patio.  These people use only brand new tools (brand name label showing of course) in a perfect-world dust free environment.  The pictures make it look like it's a Sears catalogue. ---  --- Aside from that, the articles are great making it one of the best magazines for the do-it-yourselfer.  I have saved more money from the tips in this magazine than any other magazine I subscribe to.  Most articles can be done by any semi-skilled craftsman with access to a decent set of tools, making it an approachable magazine for the DIY'er. ---  --- I highly recedommend this magazine in conjunction with Fine Homebuilding magazine.  In that magazine you will find that the pictures are of real people operating used tools in a real environment.  The articles in Handyman are a bit more down-to-Earth, but together you will get the most benefit
I bought this item thinking I was getting a healthy snack. The fruit is soaked in high fructose corn syrup, and it is extremely sweet. Not health
With a good script and a director better suited to the material (I've read Pedro Almodovar expressed interest in adapting the novel and Jonathan Demme was originally attached to direct), Asylum could have been a superb exploration of romantic obsession and a great showcase for star Natasha Richardson.  Unfortunately, the film poorly tries to condense too much plot and things happen so fast that the film fails to fully explore the psychology of its characters in cinematic terms... a pretty major flaw for a movie that is supposed to be an exploration of the psychological effects of sexual obsession. ---  --- The basic plot concerns the affair between the bored psychiatrist's wife (an excellent Natasha Richardson) and one of the asylum's patients (an equally good Marton Csokas), under the watchful eye of the patient's doctor (Ian McKellen).  There are several plot twists in the last part of the movie, some of which seem quite preposterous, at least in the way the movie was shot.   ---  --- The only reason to watch this movie is to see Natasha Richardson.  She does her best in spite of the choppy script, and she even won a Best Actress award in London for this film.  However, as a psychological thriller or an exploration of sexual repression and obsession, director David Mackenzie has done an extremely sloppy job.  (In fact, I remember that in the promotional interviews Richardson, credited as an executive producer, sounded very disappointed about the way the movie turned out.
Abel's Island is about a mouse named Abel.  He encounters a hurricane that separates him from his wife.  After the storm, he ends up on an island where he cannot escape because of the current surrounding the island.  He tries many ways to return to the place he loves, but all fail.  About a year after countless attempts to leave the island, a frog appears by accident. Gover, the frog, becomes friends with Abel and says he will come back with people to help Abel.  Abel's plans to return were very interesting.  His methods were very creative so it held my attention.  My favorite part was when he was fighting the owl.  I found a similarity between Abel and Stuart Little. Both had to navigate water. Stuart little was successful, but was Abel?  Read the book to find out.  
I received this magazine as a gift... and I will not renew. Articles are very short and refer you to websites, telephone numbers, etc. for more information. Why so little information in the magazine itself? --- Additionally, there is a load of advertising: take that out of the equation and the magazine would only be a few pages long. --- For my money, there is much more available elsewhere, including a "google" search. Waste of paper, IMHO
As popular as Prince was in the 80's, it's hard to believe it has taken 18 years for Under The Cherry Moon to find it's way to DVD.  Critics largely considered the film a stinker, especially considering it was only two years behind Purple Rain, but Under The Cherry Moon was a very good film, although very different than Purple Rain.  Shot in black and white, Under The Cherry Moon starred Prince as Christopher Tracey, him and his buddy Tricky (Jerome Benton from The Time) are living it up in Europe.  They wine and dine the rich and upper class and take their money, basically they are gigolos.  They swear it never gets personal until Mary Sharon comes into the picture.  Christopher falls for Mary in a big way, but her father Issac Sharon isn't having it.  Drama ensues. The soundtrack is awesome and includes the songs "U Need Another Lover Like You Need a Whole In Your Head," "Mountain," and "Kiss" and the DVD includes the videos for the songs shot for the film.  A must have for Prince fans.
If you read the label on this stuff it says 100% sucrose and that is what this stuff is plain and simple sugar. You're basically paying $10 dollars for something you could get at a grocery store for $1.50. This is a rip off! There is nothing special about this stuff in terms of size color everything!!! Just buy sugar!!!!!
This was an amazing read. I couldn't put it down. ---  --- If you like CSI, then you will love this books. The forensics are very interesting.  ---  --- You would never guess who the killer is! I was totally shocked when I got to the end
The retail price is totally wrong. I could get it for cheaper from another vendor
I purchase my unit a little less than one year ago and now I am shopping for a different brand.  It worked fine for the first summer season in Texas, but now that it is spring almost summer--it does not turn on at all.  I have completed all of the manual's troubleshooting in addition to purchasing a new bulb and cable for it.  But, it does not work anymore after only 1 summer usage!  I do not recommend!!
I liked this product so much-I'm buying some for my family members who live out of town!  Only a small amount leaves my hair feeling soft, shiny and moisturized.  And it's great on my ends-especially with roller sets! Plus, my darling hubby loves the scent. I use it along with the Khoret Amen Hair Oil

I bought two Clarisonic brushes - one as a gift and one for myself.  Although the product works well, unfortunately, both brushes were defective.  The trouble started occurring about two months after using.  One brush started out with two speed settings, but eventually only functioned at the low setting.  The other brush started turning on by itself and eventually could not be recharged! ---  --- My experience with the customer service has been terrible.  They would not replace my brush for me even though the product was still under warranty.  Be careful if you are going to travel abroad.  The warranty on the brush is nulled if you use the brush in a power outlet other than 110v!  
The software was installed flawlessly.  Programs have worked successfully and been exactly what i need and wanted
In the days where people play games to shoot random people and other stuff...It's nice to know there's still art in videogames. I loved this game. My brother heard about it and I rented it soon after. Wow... --- Graphics: 10/10 Lovely, LOVELY, BEAUTIFUL! Enough said --- Sound: 20/10 Music is so pretty. I love the orchestral going on. --- Story: 7/10 The average, "Save the princess" game... --- Controls: 8/10 Hard to deal with the horse. Easy when walking --- Overall: 9/10 This is a beautiful game but it's upsetting it's so short. I can easily say this game introduced me into full-on puzzle games. --- It does have something to do with Ico but no one really knows if it's a prequel, a sequel or anything..
I just recently bought this and when I installed it Norton caught 2 viruses on the install CD.
This pillow works! Sleeping in the car used to make my son cranky  --- becausehis head would painfully drop to his chest making him fuss & cry.  Now with this comfy pillow, he naps peacefully & wakes up happy
this product works great for bodywash but is much too thick to be a shampoo
I just received a first-time correspondence from Kids Discover threatening referral to a credit agency for copies of a magazine that we didn't order and haven't received.  There is no telephone number to call and only a p.o. box to correspond with.  I suspect many people just pay the bill in order to avoid any trouble.  I sent a notice to the Consomer Complaint agency in the states involved in order to get this fraud on record
I am a huge fan of world war 2 first person shooters. I've been with the genre since the begining of medal of honor. since then, not too much has been more impresive to me than call of duty. It was a wonderfual game and still is. Call of Duty 2 was even better. Does this new game maintain the stellar streak the series is on? in a word, yes. Although, it is alot more of the same. But then again, why mess with a great formula? Call of Duty 3 works because it is exactly what the original game was built around, sheer intensity....and also alot of fun. But then you might say, well i've played COD2, are you saying its the same? Yes and No. The basic mechanics are the same and the few newly added gameplay elements do little to nothing for the overall game so in escense. Yea, its the same game. But this time around the levels are bigger and look o so much prettier. Honestly, these are some of the most amazing visuals on the xbox 360. I dare say it puts my beloved COD2 to near shame. The lighting and texturing is beautiful and the explosions are heart stopping to behold. The life like graphics are complimented by a brilliant musical score. Oh, and if anyone should wonder about the ingame soundeffects, just pop in a previous call of duty game and imagine it amped up even more. Seriously, the battlechatter has never been so nicely integrated. COD3 is yet another amazing world war 2 game that will certainly keep veterans of the genre happy and content, meaning on the edge of your seat. The newly implimented rag doll physics and destructable enviroments will make sure you stay there too. I reccomend this game to anyone and everyone who has played a world war two first person shooter and enjoyed it because what we have here ladies and gentelmen is the latest and greatest, the best that money can buy
This Bobber Cooler is definitely a conversation piece.  I have had so many comments about it. I used it when floating down a small river near home (No Rapids, just calm water), it doesn't hold its weight, literally. The first thing is that the opening is in the center of the cooler, making it impossible to get drinks out with out pulling the whole cooler out of the water.  The opening seam rides just barely about the water, and since it is round the weight shifts a little and the seam will dip into the water. The cooler then fills up with water, which almost immediatly melts the ice, and as it fills up it will sink to the bottom.  maybe if there was a rubber gasket to seal it better, it might be ok.  The 2 plastic clasps on each side used to close the cooler are really easy to break off, plus they are facing the wrong direction. If you bump something like a rock or a log, it will push the clasp back and then unlatch the cooler. ---  --- This cooler might be good to use in bodys of water that do not have current, like a pool, but I don't suggest towing it behind anything.  I suggest using one of the many inflateble coolers on the market
This small package of noodles came to me in a huge box, which I thought was a huge waste and completely unnessecary.  And, when I opened the box, a small melted ice pack failed to keep the noodles cold, so they were hot and smelled terrible.  I had to throw them in the trash outside right away because of the smell, and called Gristedes and left an upset, yet polite message.  It has been almost a week and I have not heard from them.  Don't waste your money on this supposedly "great deal."  It's not worth it
I expected this to be dry and mechanical like lots of other math texts - too-technical proofs, homework questions irrelevant to the material, insufficient explanations for why things are the way they are. This book really surprised me because it wasn't "mathy" at all. It doesn't just throw proofs at you expecting you to wade thru page upon page of math notation until you understand - it gives you the intuitive side of important concepts, which means you only need common sense, not an intensive mathematical background to get everything. The examples they picked simplify rather than confuse the concepts. Each easily and naturally leads to the next. If there's anything not thoroughly elaborated, they were sure to cover it in the homework questions, by gently prodding the reader along towards the answer step by step instead of smacking them in the face with impossible problems. Homework questions supplement the material perfectly and basically leave you with a full and well-rounded impression of what the concepts mean as well as when and why to use them, not just how to plug numbers into some formula. --- If anything, I'd say this book errs on the side of caution in that in some sections it could pick up the pace a little. But then again, you could always just skip the easier parts
Whether you are diabetic, eating low carb, or just want great pasta, this product is perfect in every way.  I have served dreamfields pasta to over twenty people, told them I was trying a new brand of pasta, and asked them what they thought.  Every last person said it was wonderful, and not one person guessed that it was not "regular" pasta.  Most said it was better than the pasta they use.  Try it...you'll love it
This salve is just perfect under Bliss's Softening socks. It's amazing how much you can smear on, leave on with the socks for at least half an hour and have all those great softening agents completely absorbed when you take off the socks. It leaves feet renewed. Use it once or twice a week to tame tough tootsies
We bought this tubside seat just today and tried it out for the first time with our baby, who is 5.5 months old and just sitting up on his own.   ---  --- Initially it looked great, seemed very sturdy and we thought he would love being able to sit and play with his toys.  However, getting him in and out we noticed that the plastic edges around where his legs go is actually very sharp, and as our baby is on the tall end of the spectrum, it was impossible to get him in and out of the seat without scraping up his little legs and knees.  ---  --- It's not as if he is going to get any shorter, so I don't think there is any solution to the problem.  I think Safety 1st could have done a better job of making the plastic in that area more comfortable, or even put some padding at that location.  I'm surprised more reviewers didn't have this problem.  For our baby, who normally loves bathtime, it was a painful and frightening experience. ---  --- We will be returning the item.  Since you can't leave your baby unattended in water anyway, we might as well just get a non-slip mat and hold him until he gains more balance.  I recommend you save your money on this one
I've been using Norton Antivirus 2002 with annual updates of patches forever with Norton Internet Security 2003. Now that it's time to renewal Norton Antivirus, I thought I switch to Trend Micro Internet Secuirty 2005 after all the glowing wins it received from certain mainstream computer magazines. I like Norton 2002 but it was a memory resident hog in the TaskManager considering I was running a P3 500 laptop with 196MB on WinXP Pro, resources are valuable. Also newer Norton Antivirus version were a hit and miss.  After also reading reviews at Amazon, I took the plunge with Trend Micro. My review of this product can be best summarize along with it's relations to Norton Antivirus 2002 (updated). ---  --- Pros of Trend Micro 2005: --- 1. Fastest virus scan I've seen. I have not find any virus in my system yet whereas Norton would fail in about .01% of the time( i.e. one stalling virus every year). --- 2. Check incoming and outgoing mail like Norton --- 3. Scan selected files as I chose just like Norton --- 4. Alert and Block virus threats --- 5. Monitor nearby Wifi connection --- 6. $25 mail in rebate making the price net at $15. (It's been 2 months since I've mailed it and not received it yet). --- 7. Uses about 10MB of system background resources versus Norton's 30MB. ---  --- Cons against Trend Micro 2005: --- 1. Very annoying  auto-virus update every day that I log on the internet. I only have a 56k connection and updating takes 5 minutes. I'm not trying to save the internet but everyday update may be a bit too much so I would prefer to have a preference setting that I can choose myself. Norton is not as annoying. ---  --- 2. On a wifi network, Trend Micro Firewall failed 5 of the Gibson research Shields Up test. Ports were open. Norton Internet Firewall close all major holes except for the non-critical ones which wasn't a big worry. I ended up disabling Trend Micro Firewall and using the Norton Firewall instead as it's a full software and much better analysis and deeper protection. ---  --- 3. Anti-spam and data protection were subpar as I got advertisements and  pop-up from certain websites like West Cost major newspaper. Using Norton Firewall stops them dead; never seen them again. ---  --- 4. Still waiting for rebate. ---  --- Overall, I think using TrendMicro Internet Security 2005 for it's fast virus check and a separate Norton Internet Firewall is the ideal combo for me. On it's own merit, Trend Micro would be perfect only if RAM and other resources are low as the case with my laptop but I wouldn't mind using Norton if I had plentiful more RAM. ---  
First of all, it's sad that someone would put out a product (the 360) that gets so hot that it tends to fry itself, unless you spend another 10% of the product cost on a little series of fans. ---  --- Second, I attached this. I plugged it in. It wouldn't even turn on. Waste of money. Do yourself a favor and just keep your machine in an open, uncluttered, unblocked area. If you absolutely must provide additional airflow, just point a $10 clip-on fan at it
I ordered this items in size xx-large for my 20 months doughter and there are huge. Maybe will fit when she will be 4 or 5, although she looks normaly for her age
Recently decided to purchase the Treo 750, but after ordering Amazon sends shipping info and it won't arrive for about a month and a half!  I cancelled and went to Cingular and purchased for a lesser price and had it in my hands immediately.  Sad...
This Games Story Takes Place Before GTA 3 So It's Sort Of Like A Prequal Set In Liberty City Compared To The Original It Looks A Lot Better Plus They Added Bikes And Motor Cycles And Attempted To Improve The Targeting By Using The Targeting System From San Andreas I Hate The Targeting But Being Able Target Manually Is A Good Thing If You Don't Own A Psp I'd Suggest Getting This Game But If You Do And Played It On That System There Really Isn't Any Point To Buying This Game Unless You Really Really Love GTA
Clever and stylish design; a lot of colors to choose from; and an excellent performance, best sport shoe eve
This review is about the Oral-B Flexisoft replacement heads. Coupled with the Braun electric toothbrushes, this is one of the most effective aids to oral hygiene ever developed. My introduction to Oral-B goes back over 27 years to a USAF basic training briefing; a dental technician held up an Oral-B toothbrush with medium bristles and said "this is the toothbrush you need if you want to keep your teeth" or some such statement like that. Well, I haven't lost one yet.  ---  --- The motorized mechanicals of the toothbrush do most of the work while you guide the oscillating round head around and over your pearly whites. While the heads are undeniably pricey when looked at just in dollars and cents, there is value in the fact that the total package actually makes a rather mundane chore a little more fun while actually living up to the claim that it does a better job on your teeth than manual brushing.  ---  --- Since I've always believed the entire surface area of the toothbrush head was meant to be covered with toothpaste and the size of the head on these is smaller than the average brush, I know I'm using less toothpaste to do the same job. While this is no big deal, the long term economic benefit is plaque under control, healthy gums and a bright smile full of natural teeth. It's kind of hard to deny it works since my dentist has confirmed the positive results upon direct examination. ---  --- Just be careful what model of these brush heads you are selecting and watch the pricing. Oral-B uses a kind of color code for the bristles, and the ones that have the colored indicator bristles in a line with the shaft are the Flexisoft model that seems to equate to medium hardness.  ---  --- Enjoy life
It took a while to get this product but, it was worth the wait. The iron heats up quickly and easily. When you have arthritis like me, you appreciate the simplicities in this product. It heated up fast and safely AND it was so easy to grip the handle. It definitely styled my hair without over-processing it. Thanks
Once I figured this software out, I was able to do a slideshow of my pictures, integrate video, and produce a decent DVD.  Only problem is, it distorts all my video footage by forcing it into 4:3 whereas my DVD camcorder shoots in 16:9.  This sucks.  I have been buying other software packages ever since trying to get my video to stay in 16:9.  Roxio support did e-mail me back with the blanket statement that it doesn't support 16:9 at this time.  Even in the new 7.5 version.  Roxio needs to join the rest of us in 2005 and bring their software to be compatible in widescreen
One of the best Doobie collections out there "Greatest Hits" lives up to its name focusing on the singles the band recorded and that charted in their long career. Some of the songs here are the single versions (meaning they were edited and are shorter than the album versions)and this might be a problem for some fans as they may want the full length versions of songs. Maybe it's because they were trying to squeeze more music onto the CD. Either way fans may want to be aware of that. ---  --- In fact even on the boxed set we get "Listen to the Music", "Nobody" and "Rockin' Down the Highway" in their single incarnations. Perhaps its because that was the way fans originally heard them on the radio. Either way, fans looking for the full length versions of these songs would do well to pick up one of the import "Greatest Hits" collections or wait for the remastered CDs coming out later this year. This set does have one track not on the boxed set--"Without You" a great rocker. The CD booklet is exactly like the larger booklet that comes with the boxed set just laid out a bit differently. ---  --- This definitely covers the highlights of the band's career whether it be the Tom Johnston rockin' years, Michael McDonald's blue-eyed soul stage or the band's reunion phase this has a bit of it all.  Personally, I would love to see a two disc distillation of the band's "Greatest Hits" with a second disc of album tracks such as "I Cheat the Hangman", "Losin' End", "The Captain and Me" and "How Do the Fools Survive?". In the meantime this single disc compilation will have to do for most fans.  ---  --- The sound is terrific pulling from the remasters produced by Bill Inglot for the boxed set. Detail and clarity is remarkable and puts the previously issued "Best of" pair to shame. This is the only place to get their singles from their first in 1970 "Nobody" to their last (when this compilation was put togetherin 2001) "Dangerous" released in 1991.   --- 
Carson McCullers, one of America's greatest Southern writers, was often misunderstood, as many people were put off by or unwilling to  deal with her (at the time) controversial subject matter. MCCullers used the grotesque as exaggerated symbols of everyday experience. The loneliness and isolation of her gothic-like characters were merely extreme examples of feelings we all have, though magnified and intensified to the nth degree. ---  --- Tennessee Williams, in his introduction to MCCullers' "Reflections in a Golden Eye", posed the question (in a mock dialogue) most people asked about writers of the 'gothic' school such as Carson McCullers, Flannery O'Connor, Katherine Anne Porter and Eudora Welty: "Why do they write about such dreadful things?" Williams replies, " In my opinion it is most simply definable as a sense, an intuition of an underlying dreadfulness in modern society.. Why have they got to use..symbols of the grotesque and the violent? Because a book is short and a man's life is long... The awfulness has to be compressed."  ---  --- McCullers, unlike any writer I have ever read, pierces the heart of themes such as love, isolation, and loneliness with her lucid, poetic prose. Tennessee Williams, in Virginia Spencer Carr's biography of McCullers summed up McCullers' writing as follows: "I have used the word 'heart', but it is not an adequate word to describe the core of Carson McCullers' genius....I believe, in fact I know, that there are many, many with heart who lack the need or gift to express it. And therefore Carson McCullers is what I would call a necessary writer: She owned the heart and the deep understanding of it, but in addition she had that 'tongue of angels' that gave her power to sing of it, to make of it an anthem.
If you have had any exposure to good literature, you will find this novel nearly insufferable. The symbolism is cliche, narrative style predictable and unoriginal, and the book as a whole is this woman's self-indulgent notion that the story of her family makes a good read. If she had any creative ability, she could use her family history as a starting point, but she does very little to distinguish her writing as exciting and fresh. Dull, dry, predicatable, callow, and unfortuantly a requirement from a lit professor who has insulted my eight semesters as an English student
If you are not a literature professor or don't read everything that the library gets in, you will probably find this game extremely difficult. On the other hand, you now have a book list
Why? ---  --- Why waste your time and money on producing crap? ---  --- Sony execs must be out of their minds. The Ghostbuster fans have been waiting years, and writing countless petitions to get the episodes on DVD, and this is what they come up with? ---  --- No. Give us season DVDs. Give us a 140 episode box set. Give us something. Not 4 non-sequential episodes on a disc that can hold MANY times that. ---  --- What a waste. This product gets 1 star because, apparently, you can't give it zero
Each time you replace the battery you have to reload all of your data.  Don't waste your money on this one
After three weeks my brush broke too!  Cannot find a replacement, I do not want to buy a whole new rack.  Design fault that they should correct.  Not good enoug
These were a little smaller than expected so if you have really big hands look to see if you can get a bigger size.  A little tight at the wrists, but these have great padding and serve me well
[...]The mouse is larger than needed and lighter than the average mouse.  I have dual screens and need an extra accurate mouse.  This is NOT it.  Unfortunately with this one, the sensor doesn't stand still.  My screensaver hardly ever turns on because when the mouse is just sitting there, the arrow jumps in all directions about 2-3 arrow spaces around.  Don't be fulled by the laser technology in this particular mouse.  My old optical was better. 
I was unsure if this product would be as good as the one sold at Brookstone.  It is great!  Just as good as the iJoy sold at Brookstone, but much cheaper.  I love it
Whoever is marketing this should be whipped with razor wire. Do not buy, unless you enjoy wasting your money
I shoot with a Canon 20D and have used the Canon EF 75-300mm f/4.5-5.6 III USM lens. I've always noticed the limitations of this lens when shooting amateur softball. I reviewed the lens lineup at the Canon website and decided on the Canon EF 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6L USM Lens. The 100-400mm is a great lens, but it can be a bit soft.  For that reason I decided to add the Canon EF 70-200mm 2.8/f IS USM telephoto zoom lens to my lens collection.  ---  --- This is a serious lens meant for serious photographers. Being an L lens, there is a lot of features and is manufactured with better materials with a high level of dust and moisture resistance. The construction is sturdy and consists of 23 elements in 18 groups.  The four Super UD-glass elements largely eliminate the secondary spectrum reducing residual chromatic aberration. An improved 8-blade circular aperture offers a more pleasing out-of-focus image.  The Canon EF 70-200mm lens weighs in at about 3.24 lbs/1,470 g, and accepts 77mm filters with a minimal focusing distance of 4.3 ft/1.3 m.  This lens is compatible with the extenders 1.4x II and 2x II.  Be sure to get a good quality UV haze filter to protect the front lens element. ---  --- Being white, this lens looks a bit strange, but helps keep it stay cool when shooting in the sun. Some people are concerned that being white, it attracts attention to criminals. From my experience, my 20D attracts attention regardless of what lens I put on it. In addition, I most likely have a camera bag and tripod/monopod with me to further attract attention.  I personally doubt a thief looking for something to steal is taking the time to evaluate the cost of the item and are more concerned with the ease of taking something they can unload. I try to make things difficult for would be thieves and have insurance as a back up.  ---  --- The dual IS system has two modes. Mode 1 is for stationary subjects while mode two is for moving subjects. It is recommended that the IS function is not used on a tripod; however I have used it on my monopod with success. The IS helps to eliminate camera shake and helps stabilize the lens when shooting from a moving vehicle. While there are limitations to what the IS can do, it can give you a few extra stops. Just keep in mind, the IS attempts to eliminate camera movement, not the movement of the subject being photographed.  ---  --- This lens permits for auto or manual focus depending on how the switch is set. There is also a switch to shift from a 1.4m/4.6ft to infinity or 2.5m/8.2ft to infinity.  ---  --- Included with this lens are the Tripod mount, lens hood, and storage case. The tripod mount is the best option to use when mounting to a tripod. This helps to balance the load. Mounting the camera instead creates an unbalanced set up that may topple over. The case is a zippered soft case (LZ1324) that can also be purchased separately. The lens hood (ET-86) is used to reduce lens flare and can protect the front element in certain situations.  Often times, Amazon recommends purchasing the lens case and hood, however they are normally included with the lens. ---  --- The Canon EF 70-200mm is such an awesome lens, it almost fails to compare to the Canon EF 75-300mm.  The Canon 100-400mm lens is a well used option for me, but the clarity and sharpness of the 70-200mm IS lens is more refined. The auto-focus is quiet and quick. This lens can be used for portraits, landscape, sports or as a general walk about lens.  The f/2.8L combined with the IS makes this a good option for certain low light situations.  The features add creative versatility. The Canon EF 70-200mm IS lens comes at a price, but it is worth every bit of it.  ---  --- PROS:  --- Incredible clarity and sharpness  --- Quiet and quick auto-focus  --- Features add creative versatility  --- Dual IS system  ---  --- CONS:  --- Heavy and bulky (This should be expected with these types of lenses
I purchased this program about 1.5 years ago. I have been casually studying German through other programs for about 4 years. The best basic words-only is through Unforgettable Languages (very basic, but easy as heck to learn). Rosetta Stone is the best for understanding gender, verb usage and adapting to the German style of sentence structure. I absolutely love all the functionality and versatility of the program. It is incredibly challenging to go from reading to typing and to speaking.  --- The only negative is that the CD has to be used to run the program. Even with an accelerated CD-Rom, the starting/stopping of the CD is distracting. If that feature were corrected, it would be perfect
I personally do not see how this book could have won a Newbery medal. While the author portrays sibling rivalry effectively, that is about the only positive aspect of this book. The fact that the teenage girl protagonist has a crush on an elderly man is disgusting and is presented as not only being acceptable but understandable. Sara's family is also unsupportive to her sulky and jealous attitudes. Her grandmother is a busybody and consantly antagonizes the family. Sara's twin sister gets all the attention and love, leaving Sara starving for parental care. Finally, Christianity is portrayed as harsh and judgemental. This book could possibly be acceptable for adults but never for children and I would not recommend it to anyone. I wasted my time with this book: please don't waste yours.
My daughter was having horrible gas pains and we tried everything under the sun to help her out.  Then, we switched to these bottles and it worked like magic.  AMEN!  I don't care how many parts there are -- it is totally worth the sleep we are now getting
It does everything I hoped for and more!! As a new user of Acrobate, I am very definitely impressed... in part by the ease with which I am able to learn the program, as well as its functionality!
These are a big improvement over the porcelin ones.... The food seemed to cook faster and tasted better... They were heavier than I thought they would be and was a perfect fit for my Silver B.
My husband, a non-celiac, eat this pancake mix (to make waffles) all the time.  The recipe calls for egg whites to be beaten until stiff, so it is a bit more work than many other mixes.  But, it is worth it!  The result tastes like *real* waffles.  Kinnikinnick mix also makes good tasting waffles, but the texture isn't as nice
The Equus 3130 is a fantastic product!  It does all I need...and at a very affordable price.  The Equus website is functional and easy to navigate. ---  --- Amazon delivered as promised with FREE shipping...and I had a GREAT transaction.  Thanks
I received exactly what I ordered very quickly
I car camp around 6 weeks a year. Every night on a different spot. I was looking for a light and sturdy table. Easy to setup and easy to pack. This table is not the right table for me. Yes it's light. That's the only good atribute I can find for this table. It's cumbersome to setup. The plastic tabs that hold it together are very fragile. The end caps on the ribs of the top surface started falling off even before the table was assembled. It's low to the ground. I would not buy this table again, nor I would recommend anyone to buy it. I give it one star because I can't give it any lower. ---  --- Alvaro --- Sacramento, CA
The image showing for this spoon set is not correct. The image is for Bendable Spoon which used to feed the baby before 12 month old and the description for the image is for baby after 12 month old. When you place the order they send you the set of spoon and fork with metal end for feeding the toddler not the plastic one for feeding the infant
Unfortunately I had to return the unit because it was not designed to be used on a Mac 10.4 program( the tech at the company said he was not aware it was meant to be used by a Mac.
There are probably more authentic ways to make real BBQ, but nothing any easier.  If what you like about BBQ is the flavor, not the work, this unit is for you.  Add water to the pan, chips to holder, put some dry rubbed pork [...] on one (or all) of the four grates, light the gas and you are good to go.  It holds temperature very well unattended.  Adding more chips two additional times gives you all the smoke flavor you could want.  Your friends will think you are a genius
Dont waste your money on this one. the picture is cute. but the quailty of the toy isnt any good. the frosting doesnt even stay in the hole and the box is flimsy it would never last with a child. the concept is supposed to be like the game memory,your supposed to turn over the donuts and match the ones with the same frosting. your better off just buying the real memory game. the only thing this is good for is the pretend food concept and even with that it isnt worth this price.
 ---  I grew up reading Harold Evan's Sunday Times - in the late 1970s it provided a window on the world that few other papers could. I particularly remember comprehensive coverage of Egyptian President Sadats historic visit to Jerusalem; ongoing coverage of Soviet dissidents and a very welcome (I'm Irish) editorial urging Britain to consider withdrawal from Northern Ireland.  However, from today's perspective, the paper's foreign coverage seemed to be written from a point of view which could be summarised as `what would the world do without Henry Kissinger?' [Indeed this has always seemed to be Mr. Kissinger's view also]; and that Soviet unreasonableness was a product of American hawkish unreasonableness and that balance, compromise and reasonableness were achievable with enough negotiation.  My memory is of positive disdain for the emerging tax revolt in California and absolute dread at the more confrontational foreign policy approach being urged by followers of Governor Reagan.  A major positive for me was the explanatory diagrams and the furtively taken photographs of Soviet missiles (SS-20s?) being deployed in Russian forests.  I was reminded of these diagrams in 2002/3 when the modern Sunday Times gave excellent descriptions - supported by diagrams - of Saddam's mobile chemical/biological weapons labs - which turned out not to exist.    ---  In saying all the above, I mean both to pay tribute to Harold Evans and to put in context the criticisms I have of this book - which contains descriptions of his triumphs as Sunday Times editor and his difficulties as Times Editor under Rupert Murdoch.  The book has three sections - the first describes some of the episodes which made Evan's Sunday Times great - the investigative reports from the Insight team and others, of malicious cover-ups of poor quality in the pharmaceutical industry (Thalidomide) and the aircraft industry (McDonnell Douglas); the publication of the Crossman Diaries - laying bare the rivalries and mutual disdain of the members of the British Labour Cabinet.  Having established his credentials  as a `vertical' journalist - Evan's term, which he describes as `seeking to get to the bottom of things' - and lauding his proprietors, the Thomson's, for allowing him to do so, the second part of the book deals with the advent of Mr. Murdoch as owner.  The machinations of Murdoch to gain control are fascinating, the Thomson's were drained both financially and personally by the losses induced by union activity, and they secretly dealt with Murdoch while other offers were being pursued by the editors.  Murdoch eventually won ownership of both the Times and Sunday Times, having given guarantees of editorial freedom to a board of `national directors', guarantees, which if breached, were theoretically amenable to criminal legal sanction.  As part of the change of ownership Evans was offered the editorship of the Times - one of the free worlds most revered titles.   In his description of the paper, Evans reveals an almost po-faced reverence for the place of the Times as part of the British Establishment - he sees it as the paper of record, upholding fair, non-partisan and accurate journalism which British society has come to expect. One feature of this is his constant enumeration of people's educational background, almost every colleague is named and then his/her school and university are listed - for example Joe Smith, Winchester, Oxford, to establish both social class and academic (perhaps intellectual) credentials.  He documents the `four pillars' of the Times as its reporting of Parliament, its legal coverage, its obituaries and its leader columns.  Oh dear! Stolid stuff, from the fearless, vertical, investigative editor. Nonetheless this section contains fascinating accounts of Evan's new broom editorship coming to terms with the rather lazy attitude to scoops and freshness of news which, by implication, criticise his predecessor as editor (William Rees Mogg); and show that change was indeed necessary at the institution.  Looming behind this story is Murdoch's general management style - haphazard interventions, secretive finances and lack of budgeting and planning.  From the text it seems to me that Murdoch was overstretched with transatlantic acquisitions, rather than covertly scheming to undermine Evans.  ---  The third section of the book reads a bit like Macbeth - Murdoch plots to renege on his guarantees and to impose his will on the editors. The text here is well paced and descriptive - the tension plays havoc with everyone, save perhaps Murdoch, Evan's second-in-command betrays him, various functionaries within the paper either resign or become lackeys, the `national directors' turn out to be paper tigers (this is too good a pun to delete), the Thatcher government sides with Murdoch and fails to taken any action as the guarantees are broken, piecemeal.  The thrust of this section reveals Evans as tragic hero, valiantly striving to uphold freedom of speech against the devious, double-dealing Murdoch, whose lackeys live in fear of his disapproval.   However, by the time I got to this section I had, sadly, lost a lot of respect for Evan's impartiality, his defence of press freedom seemed to me to cloak an innate inability to face change in the form of new commercial and political realities.  This was reaffirmed in my mind when, on the day that Evan's agreed to reign, who should phone to commiserate but Henry Kissinger!  ---  In the end I think the book is important in that it is illustrates that one important feature of change and leadership is that they are neither comfortable nor, initially at least, popular.   Evans, though personally engaging - and I'm sure mercurial and demanding - came to represent a set of fading political beliefs. The change occurring at the times these events described were taking place saw the emergence of economic individualism unleashed by lowering taxation rates; the antipathy to organised labour and active military competition with the Soviet Union.   The fading, indeed failing, Social Democratic consensus was overthrown by a more individualistic and competitive set of beliefs and the process was quite ugly, given the sincerely held beliefs on both sides.  I believe Evans and Murdoch were representative shadows of this change.  The rest of the story - Evans attractive forthrightness, Murdoch's furtive acquisitiveness - while the human interest focus of the story, are ultimately a side show. ---  This book is well told, highly dramatic and engaging, however seen at a remove of twenty five years it is a lament from someone who worked hard to become part of an establishment whose day was done.
Magic looks very nice on DVD. Solid clean picture quality with original basic mono soundtrack. A pleasant suprise from Dark Sky Films
Beware of this camera! The camera overall works great. We have had it for more than a year now and it takes clear, bright pictures and is very easy to use.  Very nice compact size.   ---  --- However, as others have pointed out, the battery is the fatal flaw in this camera and we will be looking for a non-Elph replacement for fear we will run into the same problem again.  There is NO battery meter until it needs to be recharged or replaced.  We were warned about this so I thought, no problem, I'd get two batteries and be ready to switch them when charging was needed.  But what we found out is that the batteries themselves quickly retain less and less charge so that now, they last only a few minutes each before another charge is needed. I had previously thought that this problem of retaining less charge over time was only for the much older battery designs and am dismayed to find myself looking for another camera so soon.
I had this model, or at least it looked the same, for a few years and it worked exceptionally well.  It finally broke down recently and I thought I was lucky enough to find it again, but they must have changed the product significantly because it does not work very well at all.  Actually, it is virtually useless as it only partially gets the job done, which, of course is like not having it done at all
This is an excellent battery that powers my Canon 5D camera very well. Although I haven't tested it against the spec for how many shots I can get from it, I've been very impressed with the longevity of it's charge
I finally got a Snow Brum after living in the northeast my whole life.  I can't believe I've wasted so much time with a regualr snow brush.  And this is a required tool if you have an SUV and hate having 50 pounds of snow slide down your wind shield when ever you hit the brakes.  You can clean off your entire car in about 1/10th of the time.  And this is great for the deep snows too.  In short, if you have snow - YOU NEED THIS
Both the original order and the attempted re-order were missing the same parts (the plate that holds the weights on the end of the rope and the nut that holds the plate on the bolt at the end of the rope) when the item arrived.  I think that this is a design flaw in the packaging
Excellent product! I really appreciate the option to choose any of the 50 given mystery cases to solve. After playing all 50, you can just start all over again! Fun, fun, fun game! THANKS
I think when many say they knew after 15 minutes who the killer was, they're actually saying they guessed who the killer was and just happened to be right.  ---  --- Think about this for a moment: What was the motive? That was something I never figured out. The killer didn't have a motive. That's what threw me off. But I guess some would say a crazed killer doesn't need a motive. But come on! Even the deranged killer in 7even had a reason for killing. Even Norman Bates had a reason for killing. ---  --- It could be the reason was explained but I just missed it because the movie was so terrible. I don't know. I really don't want to have to watch the whole movie again to figure it out. ---  --- I know if you have a lot of high profile actors in secondary roles, one of them is the killer for sure; but you're thrown off by the fact that you have Andy Garcia, D.W. Moffett, and Sam L. Jackson. So all 3 are fair game
know you. You were me. Looking for what seemed to be a simple thing - a scented candle that ACTUALLY smells up the room when you light it. You've bought the cheap ones in the grocery store that sent out the weak scent of, well, grocery store. And some candles smell like spray room deodorizer which smells like what one would use in the toilet which then make you think of poop which is not at all what you were going for in the living room. So then you hit the expensive pretty versions - perhaps even in candle stores with cute waxy names. They are not candles, my friend. They are sculptures. Some fancy ones come with cute packaging and crispy dried flowers. This is when you lose your patience. I DO NOT WANT CRISPY DRIED FLOWERS. I WANT A CANDLE THAT PUMPS A GOOD SCENT ALL OVER A ROOM WHEN I LIGHT IT. ---  --- This is it. Votivo. You will walk into the room and that room will smell like the candle. The most universally loved scent is probably Red Currant. I also enjoy Rain. The little glass it comes in makes a cute vase after the candle is done. Plus, they make perfect last minute hostess gifts, as the box is very nice and expensive-looking. ---  --- So, Votivo isn't the cheapest candle in the world. They're still cheaper than buying a bunch of cheap candles that stink...weakly stink.
Really cute boots, but the back zipper made my heels feel as if they weren't supported, and about to slide out.  The 4" heels force your feet into a near ballerina toe pose and I had to take these off after half a day.  My next step is to try some insoles for them and maybe that will help
I bought these pods on Amazon because they were a dollar cheaper than at the local grocery store.  Now I know why.  When I opened the package the Senseo Watermark was faint or hardly visable and it took me 3x the amount of pods to make a decent cup of coffee.  Buyer beware,  I am back to buying pods at the grocery store. 
I purchased the Cyberpad 8.5x11 digital Notepad with the expectation that I would be able to digitize my sketches and notes I made at work. Unfortunately the product did not live up to my expectations. The first unit that I received did not function, the usb connection to the pad was defective (the connector would not insert all the way hone). I returned it and received very promptly a new unit which at least functioned. As far as being functional that is another story. I proceed to try to use the it in either using the memory in the pad itself or using it directly connected to the computer. Either way the unit produced images that were useless. The lines that look fine on the paper pad were incomplete or missing in the digital version. Drawing a straight line was impossible even with the help of a straight edge. I let a friend try to use it and he had similar unsatifactory results. Unless this performance is a function of this manufacturer's design, I would say that this is one technology that is not ready for 'Prime Time'
I am a Sci-Fi / Space geek so this movie seemed right up my alley.  The cast was solid, the director has talent, and the story is a true story so all pretty much went well...right?  Nope. ---  --- This was a pretty dull film with very little believable suspense. The formula kept repeating over and over: Something goes wrong + Houston advises + Astronauts do something = All is well.  Lather, rinse, repeat.  Boring, VERY boring. I never once flet any real tension except for the initial "problem" which obviously was not THAT bad because everything went well in the end.   ---  --- The problem is that all of the "issues" the men faced were handled so matter-of-factly.  Rarely did anyone seem rushed or panicked.... it was just yeah, attach this tube to this tube and magically everything will be OK.  I never felt that the astronauts were really threatened, maybe a few times, but only for a minute or two.  Some reviews claim that this movie was tense and riveting.... how so I must ask?  Nothing really happened.  It was not emotional at all since the "struggles" of the men were so poorly portrayed.  To each his own I guess, but 4 1/2 stars?  Geeez, just because Tom Hanks is in it does not make the movie good follks! ---  --- The family interactions were pretty standard: Crying wife, kids asking questions, annoying media attention, etc, etc.  Yeah, I could feel for the characters to some extent, but again, this movie needed a LOT more real tension and panic to be meaningful. ---  --- I will say that the launch scene was excellent and very cool, so were some of the space shots but even those were fake with noise and Star-Trekkish special effects. ---  --- Too bad, I had high hopes for this film but was completely disappointed and bored. ---  --- NOT recommended
It's thin, so you can wear something over it.  And it helps keep the chill out. ---  --- I wear it cycling and golfing
Meguiar's NXT Tech wax is easier to use than any other wax I've ever used, and it brings back the original color of my 2000 red Honda like no other as well.Buy it, use it, love it
I was extremly disappointed when I received this. It did not fit my phone and promptly was thrown into the garbage can. I had one of the first Razor phones and it did not fit. When I got th belt clip I went to CINGULAR to upgrade my phone to a newer version and brought the belt clip... that didn't fit either. I would no recommend this product to anyone, even if it does cost a dollar... with shipping cost it costs about $6.00
I've always been a Terri clark fan but this is the first cd I've purchased by her. I was surprised at how much I really enjoyed this cd! Terri has an amazing voice and the songs kept me listening to the cd over and over again
In the Golden Age of Hollywood, each studio usually took a stab all various genres, but excelled in only one. Warner Brothers cornered gangster films, with forays into musicals (Busby Berkeley) and noir (Bogart). Universal dabbled in lots of B-films, but succeeded big-time with horror. MGM, of course, produced the best musicals. Fox did melodramas --- especially noir --- with an occasional romp on MGM's musical turf. And usually those romps hit some really bad notes. Witness the first three flicks in their Marquee Musicals series. Daddy Long Legs has Astaire and Caron, Pin-Up Girl has Betty Grable, Week-End in Havana has Alice Faye and Carmen Miranda,  The memory of these films, for the most part, is a lot better than the films themselves. The pleasant but fairly pedestrian scores, thin plots and busy character actors scurrying around propping up the story make for rough going. And make one yearn for Mickey and Judy
As most of the other reviewers, I live in a small townhome.  This chair is wonderful.  It takes up very little space and is so easy to clean.  I remove the straps and throw them in the wash and they come out so clean.  The rest of the chair is very easy to wipe clean and the tray just gets put in the dishwasher.  Despite carrots, prunes, etc. being mashed into it, the tray hasn't stained at all.  I recommend this chair to all my pregnant friends
This was purchased as a gift for a duck hunter.  He had used other head lamps but absolutely loved this one for the brightness and accuracy of the light when he moves his head.  I would highly recommend this product
I am so happy they are selling this now outside the gift set.. I have never had a lip gloss that tastes and looks and feels as great as this does! I have Amber and Dolly and plan to try a few other of the colors as its the best I have ever tried!
Klear screen has to be the absolute worst product I've ever used.  It has nearly ruined my 2001fp.  I was stupid and used it on my primary display first, instead of using the 50/50 isopropyl alcohol/water mix that's far superior to klear screen products.  My LCD now has cloudy areas and streaks that simply will not come out.   My 3 year old laptop's display looks nearly perfect because I only used the 50/50 solution on it, my 2001fp looks horrible now. 
This is a great game for any skilled star wars game freak. The graphics are pretty good and the gameplay is very fun and challenging don't listen to the negative reviews claiming the game is to hard, the people who claim it's to hard are just weak at video games granted the game can frustrate but it never get's to the point where you want to throw the game out the window. This is a good game and I highly recomend it to and star wars fan. p.s. don't buy jedi academy that game is horrible! what a shame to ruin the series like that
The book contained more profanity than I expected to read in a book by Rita Rudner.  I had expected more humor from a comedienne.  Too bad, because I really like her humor
At the young age of 25 Julie Barenson loses her husband. Shortly after he dies, a great dane puppy is delivered to her home with a note from her late husband. This part will give you the chills ... nice touch.  She names him Singer, and despite her frustrations with his size and clumsy mannerisms they grow to love each other.   After a few years of trying to get her life back together after her tragic loss, Julie begins dating 2 men--Richard, a handsome charmer who wines & dines her, brings her lavish gifts and professes his undying love very early in the relationship. The other, Mike, is a simple down to earth country type whose idea of a date is a burger, Doritos & a couple beers at the local watering hole.  So who would you choose? Ouch! I'll stop there with the comment that this could have been such a compelling story.  Instead, we are faced with trite, boring, repetitive dialogue throughout, scatterings of viewpoint shifts and a very predictible plot.  I cannot believe this is the same author who wrote The Notebook, one of my all time favorite novels. I'll have to admit the ending brought on a gush of tears.  In conclusion, Singer not only saved his owner but the book as well.
I bought this for my grandson for Christmas, he was 8 months old. This has been the best learning toy for him, along with entertainment. He has learned how the shapes work and took this on soon. It has also helped him in walking. It is entertaining for me to watch him play with this toy, he has to push the button and play the music before he pushes it. I would actually buy one more for him to have at home with Mom and Dad. This is well worth the money
I was quite pleased with this alarm clock until recently when I found that it was consistently waking me up one hour early.  I tried fiddling with the DST setting and then changing the alarm and clock times just a little but without fail it would wake me an hour earlier than I wanted.  The brightness may be a problem for some people but I found it reasonable.  Overall a good docking station, but a poor alarm clock
The first time I read this book, I was watching it all happen. i'ts like I was invisible. I admire Elizabeth for having the guts to do what she did. I would have fought back, but she did it the safe way, she didn't resist. Reading this book, you feel like you know the Smart family. I pray for all Missing Children everywhere. Elizabeth is the luckiest girl in the world! Mary Katharine was so cool and collected. she is amazing too. read this book
This has the perfect blend of sweet and salty combination without the guilt
On the whole, Bicycling is a huge disappointment. I agree with some writers that the occassional tidbits of information are good, but I don't pay for a subscription for a sidebar or two -- I read those in the newstand. Further, as I will mention below, once and a while there is a real gem of an article. ---  --- In the meantime, almost everything else they do is poor. The entire magazine is pitched at the readership as though we were all budding pros, training obsessively and fighting with that last 1% of body fat. The reality is, what Bicycling's readership principally is is rich -- in their own pages, they recently listed average household income of a subscription at $115,000. So it's not people with the ability tor ride like the pros ride, it's people with the ability to buy what the pros ride. ---  --- The result is a majority of articles and reviews that focus on just this -- $3000+ bikes (and, as one reviewer said, the occassional review of more reasonably priced choices around $1500. Wait, $1500 is *not* chump change?!?!), advanced training and eating techniques, etc., as opposed to real world riding -- centuries and club rides, touring, commuting (gasp!), etc. Even it's racing coverage is terrible -- its recent spread on the San Fran GP, one of the three most important races in the US, was 6 pages of photos, 4 of which were of people watching the race, not the racing itself. ---  --- For me, though, the worst part is its hypocrisy. In a recent issue, there was a truly excellent article on what the author called "Invisible Riders" -- low income laborers who depended on their cheap bicycles to get them to and from work sites everyday. Yet: the author mentioned several times (albeit with embarrassment) that he was riding a Seven while doing research on people whose lives depended on $100 bikes; the author commented on the significance of these riders commuting everyday, a movement which riders like Bicycling readers had never been able to mobilize (maybe because they all drive to work and the magazine does little or nothing to encourage bicycle commuting); and the five bikes reviewed in that issue ranged from $3500-$7000. ---  --- Really, really sad. One star for "Invisible Riders" and the like, and that's it
After a promising start, Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy's 1944 effort plunges into a sea of MGM mediocrity with a ludicrous plot involving the attempted murder of a boy king. However, Chef Ollie's "Steak a la Oliver" is worth a few laughs
I looked through this book at a craft store the other day, and as a person who loves the ocean and seashells, I found maybe one project in here that I would consider making.  Just about every project uses a ridiculous amount of shells so imagine the cost would be prohibitive and for this reason projects look overly ornate.  Unless that is the look you are seeking to accomplish, I wouldn't recommend this book.  Try to find "Decorating with Seashells" by Anita Louise Cran
My youngest brother, who has a pretty strange sense of humor, bought me this CD for my birthday; I wonder how he knew I didn't own it already? I don't even know where to begin with this one. What can you say about somebody who poses for an album cover in rainbow-painted panties while licking a heart-shaped lolli-pop? And the foldout poster of her reclining on pink satin sheets with said lolli-pop is downright laughable. Does she expect anyone to take her seriously? After her first album, I thought Carey had a remarkable talent that needed some fine-tuning, particularly in regard to her penchant for singing cliches. Instead of getting better, though, she has turned her career into a self-debasing fantasy of baby-doll mannerisms coupled with relentlessly monotonous song choices. Rappers like Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg, Missy Elliott and Usher are brought in to add spice, but they only drown in the sticky-sweet syrup of gunk that she chooses to sing. She may have a lot of #1 hits, but who can tell any of them apart? Rainbow is only Carey's latest entry in a career that has lowered the quality standard for divas everywhere.  ---  D-  Tom Rya
Ok, I've listened to Fat Boy Slim.  That guy's stuff isn't bad, by no means main stream, but worth while.  But ... this Norman Cook - he's horrible.  It's no wonder Cook developed an alter ego.  With the exception of a few easily recognisable tunes, I couldn't believe this "stuff" had come from the same artist that produced Praise You.  Renegade Master is the type of track I've come to know and respect (that one is a keeper), and I have to give props for I Left My Wallet in El Segundo.  Other than that, this album sounds like someone mixed songs from the first dozen records they found during their expedition to the flea market.  If this is the sound you're looking for, save a few bucks, check out your local yard sales.  So as not to be too negative, I'll say this; the printing job on the CD itself is charming.  The notion of making it look like a turntable was inspired
The pliers do the job & seem to be well made. My only problem was the awkwardness in trying to align the link. I guess if you remove the band from the watch, it would make it easier. In that case I recommend one of the pin removers that sit flat on a horizontal surface. BUT...this did do the job (even leaving the band on the watch). It comes with a smaller sized push pin that is a breeze to swap out
to set the record straight, rodney 'darkchild' jerkins produced ONE song on this album, and that is 'he said'. ---  --- that said, producer waryn 'baby dubb' campbell [also husband of erika, younger of the duo] did a great job on this album.  not at all to say that the ladies' singing hasn't always been phenomenal. ---  --- the highlights of this album include the aforementioned darkchild song, a guest apperance by fred hammond on 'this love' [their appearance on his album, speak those things' is duly noted], an impressively done cover of stevie wonder's 'you will know', and a cover of walter hawkins' 'thank you'.  yes, that is the original sampled at the end of the song. ---  --- every album that mary mary has released to this day [yes, all two of them] has proven that gospel music can be musically current-- impressive-- and still within taste.  that's what happens when you have the best on your team... ---  --- baby dubb, while being mary mary's resident producer can also be found on kierra sheard's 'let go', 'sweetest thing', 'all i am', fred hammond's albums 'speak those things' and 'somethin' 'bout love' and countless other records. ---  --- the downside:  the last two songs.  they're of forgettable quality.  while happy, forgettable.  overall, this album is an essential
I dont remember watching He Man growing up, but I think I saw this movie. I watched this movie without thinking it would be anything speical, and I was wrong. The preview really drew me into the movie before I watched it. It was pure fun, and an excellent sci fi movie. Dolph Lundgreen was the main source for finding this movie, thanks Dolph! Where the heck are you these days? I didnt check all reviews but at the very, very end of the movie Skeltor comes on and says "I'll be back". Ha! Guess that movie never happened. 
These are another neat taste experience from japan. The chocobabies, however, contain shellac as an ingredient, which kinda turned me off to them when I learned about it. The stars in this set are the strawberry-chocolate cone things, whatever they're called. They're delicious! Also, the coffee flavored ones are excellent. I'm finding I am a fan of just about anything made by Meiji, and this set is no exception
I just purchased this item two days ago (Thurs.) Today (Sat.) I removed my 160GB Seagate HHD from my Kingwin enclosure and installed it in this one. Installation was not a problem although the molex connector seems to be a tight fit and is almost touching the fan. Fan noise does not seem to be a problem yet. I used the Firewire connection instead of USB and the drive access is much faster than it was with the USB connection on the other enclosure. The price is a little steep compared to others but I got a generous rebate offer with my purchase. Although the case is plastic (my other one was aluminum and plastic) I won't be moving mine around so that won't be an issue
If you are someone who could care less about carbs and the Atkins diet, Splenda is an awesome sugar substitute.  Some dont have a choice on whether or not they can have sugar, Splenda is the best substitute I can find.  That includes my grandfather as well.  Thank you for Spenda!
This is a great pair of swimming goggles.  I swim a couple of times a week and I can't see a thing without my glasses.  This pair is very comfortable and does a great job correcting my vision.  I can't imagine swimming without them.  They have a wide field of vision, the adjustment is easy to use, and stays adjusted.  I've never had a problem with leaking.  For less then twenty dollars you can't go wrong. They are the best goggles I have ever owned.  Much better then the other brands.   ---  --- Also, I recommend going slightly less then your current prescription, as the water will magnify things. ---  --- 
I asked my sister to buy this bike for my daughter for xmas last year - she decided to buy another one for my nephew also since he is the same age as my daughter (2 yrs old at the time). She bought the two bikes at the same time, same model, same color, same store. My daughter, who is far more coordinated then my nephew, tips over very easy, my nephew seems to do fine. My daughter is taller and that may be where the difference lies. Perhaps the height of the child using the trike is what is causing the trike to tip easily. Not sure - but I know I regret that she ever got the bike -it was a total waste of money
I'd love to read a review from anyone who has purchased this camera, the Aiptek Zoom DV-6 MP Image Stabilizing Camcorder w/3x Optical Zoom.  I see the claim that it has 3x OPTICAL zoom and cannot help but question this because I am unable to find this product on aiptek-dot-com and this cam has supposedly been available since July 30th, 2006.  Am wondering what gives with that?   ---  --- Please someone, post a review of this model and hopefully, some picture results too.  Let us know about this 3x optical zoom, please!     ---  --- I had to pick a rating, so the four star rating was based on the MPVR version of this camera -- which I own and find to be a very decent gadget.  Mine is over a year old and still going strong - no problems with that model.  MP3's sound terrific.  I convert movies for viewing on the camera while on the go and... "wow" for its quality.  I have recorded sounds and more.  Very decent!  Just drag and drop my files from my PC to the SD card and I can switch out movies and MP3's.  I am happy with that model, but it does not have any optical zoom - just digital.  Still get pretty good pix tho, just use the various settings...  My little homemade movies are good, very decent, but without additional lighting, indoor movies will be dark.  This camera doesnt handle well in strong sun - I use an umbrella over my cam as I film.  Big diff.   ---  --- So, is this newer model really all that much better?  Can't wait to know!  3x optical sounds good..
This backpack is sturdy, good looking, very functional and at at least a third of the price of other similar backpacks I looked at, I'm completely satisfied with this purchase
I received my order and was very dissapointed.  The skin tones online are deceiving.  I ordered the medium and it appears like clay and ashy.  Doesn't blend well with skin.  Suggest you order a darker color to match your skin tone
For a basic money management software, this product met my expectations.  No frills but very easy to use.  Convenient calendar of payments and scheduled payments showing my balance after each transaction.  I set my account up in 20 minutes.  There isn't a manual but for the price and ease of use, I don't need one
I have hard facial hairs (Thanks Dad!!) and after being Gilette user (last used Mac 3), I finally decided to go back to classic style of shaving with Double Edge (DE) razor and blades. Merkur are the first ones I have used after the multi-edge blades and after 4-5 shaves, I am getting closer shaves (w/ no irritation) than by using mutli-edge ones. Also, to get better results, I would recommend a "Badger" brush which really softens the skin before these DE blades with a good heavy razor (Merkur is a good one) can smoothly get your facial stubs. Good luck !
I bought my Harvey toy a while ago, and I was quite pleased. It's actually very durable, like everyone else has said. The crane doesn't break off, no matter how often you play with it or how hard you may accidentaly step on it. I think the only way to break it off is via steam roller. ---  --- Anyway, highly recommended for any Thomas collector
This just arrived Thursday so these comments come with minimal time on camera so far. I am also absolutely an amateur user of camcorders so I won't be able to comment on the quality of the manual controls, etc. ---  --- I agree closely with the other two reviews so I won't repeat their details. I'll try to hit a few other topics and also compare the HC7 to the Sony HC90, an earlier model that took 16:9 standard definition video with 3 MP stills. ---  --- I have taken about one hour of HD video so far, and have viewed it through an HDMI cable on a Sony 46" XBR LCD TV (1080p). I captured a few indoor scenes, a few neighborhood outdoor scenes, and some footage at Harper's Ferry in West Virginia - river, mountain, and two trains passing by at close range while I was at the railroad station there. I can say comfortably that you won't confuse the video from this camcorder with Standard Definition camcorder video - when they say High Definition, they aren't kidding.  If your TV can show the video off to advantage and you've grown fond of HD, I think you'd be pleased with this camcorder.  In my case, the overwhelming reason I upgraded camcorders was to get the HD video, so this has made it worth the steep expense. My second requirement is to have a camcorder that took decent stills so I only have to carry one piece of equipment around. I already had this in the Sony HC90 at 3MP, so going up to 6MP was desirable but not enough to make me buy something this expensive in itself. ---  --- My only output criticisms so far are that the West Virginia footage looks a little brighter and the water a little greener than I remember. I didn't play with any settings so take that with a grain of salt. These camcorders have a lot of manual adjustments you can make which I have not explored. One or more of them undoubtedly would have given me improved footage, and I'm not unhappy with what I think I noticed in the slightest. ---  --- The stills look very good to me so far, but I've only taken about 20 and viewed them on the TV. I normally view stills on a PC. ---  --- I don't have a telephoto lens yet so I can't report on the quality of the stabilization. I used a tripod today and that was readily apparent in the stability of the video.  I was very pleased, by the way, with how well the camera did with the moving trains. Very crisp where I expected a fair bit of motion blur. ---  --- LCD size and controls have been mentioned in First Looks. I'm perfectly happy with a 2.7" LCD instead of the larger one in the UX7. So this wasn't a negative for me personally. The controls (menus) are highly similar to those of the Sony HC90 I already have. If you haven't seen them before, there's a learning curve. If you have the HC90 or another camcorder with those menus, you'll be right at home with the HC7. One note: you can configure P[ersonal]-Menus to include the things you use the most in your own order, in addition to the camcorder's menus. One thing I forgot is that each mode (video, camera, play/edit) has its own configurable personal menu. So I was looking for things to add to the Play/Edit personal menu that I was sure should be configurable, but couldn't find them. That was because they belonged only to the filming side, not to the playback side. So you've got three personal menus you can create, not one. ---  --- Battery: check the sizes on the batteries. The HC90 batteries were very thin. I think three of the batteries for the HC7 fit entirely within its case. The fourth and largest battery looked to be much bigger in one dimension such that I thought it would extend past the end of the camera 1/2" or so. The other three will fit flush into the back of the camera, though they're not behind a door or anything. ---  --- Battery life: my impression so far is that the battery life statements are accurate, but the batteries drain faster than that of the HC90. This is almost certainly a function of increased power load instead of the older batteries being better than the newer ones.  The CCDs and the stills and everything are all "more" than in the HC90. So I think I'm fine with the battery life, but you'll need to watch it and definitely have more than one battery. ---  --- Size compared to the HC90: this struck me as being about 10-15% bigger overall than the HC90. It's maybe 1/2" longer front to back, and wider as well. I think the HC7 is one notch up in size from the average camcorder I see in Best Buy. But it's noticeably smaller than last year's SR1 Sony hard disk camcorder, say. I don't see dropping this one in a coat pocket like I did with the HC90, but it's pretty light and still fits in the case I used for the HC90 if I don't load other stuff in there. ---  --- Fit in the hand: I found a Best Buy with an HC5 and UX5 on hand and played with both at the same time. These have the same footprint as the HC7 and UX7 as far as I can tell. The HC5's tape case is maybe 3/8" wider than the UX5's DVD case.  The UX5's DVD case is maybe 1/4" higher. So I found that my right-hand fingers curled nicely around the smaller but taller UX5 and it felt slightly more comfortable. However, I found that the HC5's extra width made me curl my palm slightly such that the base of the camcorder fit solidly on top of the ball of my thumb. As I played with this in the store, I realized it seemed like the HC5 actually was easier to hold stable because of this. Absolutely try these two out on your own instead of assuming this will be true for you. Just wanted to say that the two cases do differ a bit and will probably feel different to you at some level. ---  --- Tape vs DVD (really HDV vs AVCHD): I spent a lot of time wondering if the noise reported in last year's AVCHD UX camcorders would still be present, and if I would care in any case. The detailed reviews still aren't out, so I don't know whether there will be a noise problem there. But I can say I noticed nothing in the footage so far that I'd call noise, so my decision to go with the tape and HDV format looks very good to me right now. I have never had the problems people report with Mini-DV tapes, so that whole transport discussion (tape vs DVD) didn't weigh on me much. The noise discussion did have an effect on my decision, though. ---  --- Getting the video to your TV: "how much money do we have?", apparently. I played the tape back to the TV directly, but that's not a long-term solution. I have heard that you can capture the HDV video and then will be able to transform it on a PC to formats suitable for Blu-Ray or HDV burners, if you have the money. Then you need a Blu-Ray or HDV player attached to your TV. For now, it sounds like many people are archiving the HDV video to DVDs as data files. Then they burn playable DVDs where the HD is down-converted to standard definition video.  So they get to see decent versions of the video now and can produce HD versions for playback in the future as technology changes and prices drop.  One other HC7 reviewer also implied that HD files captured by Ulead software could be moved to a PS3 hard drive and played back to an HD TV from there. So far, the easy and cheap path we have for SD video to DVDs to TVs is not quite there for HD based on what I've read.  ---  --- The one extra feature I wish the camcorder had was a built-in 20X optical zoom. I'm sure this would affect both the cost and the size of the barrel negatively, so I "understand". But that would be #1 on my wish list. ---  --- Overall, I am amazed at what camcorder manufacturers can pack into these shells now.  I know we're talking computers that are way more powerful at image processing than anything that existed ten years ago.  But it is still almost like magic to drag a camcorder of this size around, take some video, and then have play it back on a high-quality HD TV looking to me like it was taken with broadcast-level equipment. I know better intellectually, but it's really great to have a camcorder like this that marries up with the new TVs so beautifully.      --- 
Sit down under a tree, give it a big hug, fire up you bong and go to sleep. That's what I was waiting for Freeman to do all movie. It's a shame that special effects that were so ground breaking were waisted on this Sci-fi Hippie flick. I'm surprised that Freeman's suit wasn't tie-dyed. Keep your money say no to drugs!
If you really like Chinese food, you might like this chicken stew.  However, it was much too sweet tasting for my tastes.   ---  --- The main reason that I give it 2 stars is that it contains the artificial sweetner Splenda (see "sucralose" in the ingredients), but that is not advertised anywhere on the package besides the small print in the ingredient list. ---  --- I personally don't eat or drink products that contain artificial sweetners for various reasons, and had I known the product contained Splenda, I wouldn't have purchased it honestly.  It has the typical Splenda "after taste.
Having just gone back to using a film camera from digital (my wife still uses digital) I have found this to be an excellant camera so far. I have taken 6 rolls of film and everyone one has came out perfect. I would recommend it
I lvoed this movie I have been looking for it for years. The story plot is ok but the dancing in the movie is awesome and the music is great. It just wants to make you get up and dance
Ever since starting on the SIMPLE ABUNDANCE journey with Sarah Ban Breathnach's first book, I have longed for an opportunity to learn one-on-one from the Queen of simplicity and authenticity. We may not be able to meet Sarah face-to-face, but now anyone can enjoy a workshop  atmosphere in the comfort of her own home. Women caught up in the  day-to-day deluge of deadlines, appointments, and commitments can now curl  up with a pillow and excavate their authentic self. I highly recommend this  book to anyone who wants to savor their life instead of living in a blur
I really like these tapes.  The first one is pretty easy, but it is very relaxing, and i use it on days when I want to take it easy.  The second one is somewhat challenging, and the third one is even more so.  These tapes are a great guide from a beginning level to a more advanced one.  Tracy Rich is a very good instructor and makes you feel comfortable.  I also like how they (Ganga White and Tracy) show different versions of the poses with one being more advanced
I bought this ear plugs, are uncomfortable, my ears hurt, and in the first use, just fall down I just prefered the ones who are made of pvc, are better
Solidly built, this tripod balances well even when used with the heavier Sony Cybershots like the DSC-R1. The remote shuttle release button helps to further reduce camera shake, which is priceless when taking photos in conditions where camera shake is amplified (high optical zoom, supressed flash, etc). ---  --- What surprises me is the fact that the shuttle release button on the remote works exactly the same as any Sony Cybershot : press halfway to focus, and all the way down to capture the shot. ---  --- The zooming buttons do not work for the Sony DSC-R1 as the camera has a manual zooming ring, but they should work fine with any other Cybershot that comes with an electronic zoom and of course, an ACC terminal. ---  --- Highly recommended.
Per the description, it sounded like these would fit snug.  Well, they fit too snug, feeling very cramped. I have a 33 inch waist, and ordered the 32/34 waist.   I'm used to boxer briefs made from cotton.  This was the first time that I've got polyester boxer briefs.  Unless you like 'um really tight, you might want to go to the next size up, or just get cotton briefs.  I'm throwing these away
Which I suppose I'm not allowed to say, what with the worldwide phenomenon that was Songs From the Big Chair. But I think it's right. Roland took the opportunity following the breakup with Curt to make an aggressively postmodern record, and return to the steely-eyed austerity that the lyrics on The Hurting always suggested.  Indeed, this album is continually proving to be ahead of its time; as a previous reviewer noted, "Goodnight Song" has what has since become a familiar AOR sound. I call it the first "Coldplay" song, and it's fair to suggest that band would never exist without Tears For Fears. ---  --- Roland also finally nails the pacing of an album here. On Songs and Seeds, 8 tracks was not enough to allow for a full dynamic arc, a sense of opening, progression, and completion; the 10 songs here have room to breathe, vary significantly between each other and finally close satisfyingly with "Goodnight". ---  --- As both Roland and Curt have matured, they have also mellowed. The anger they felt at the world and towards each other seems to be gone. And their latest album, Everybody Loves a Happy Ending, has none of the dge that made their older stuff so energizing. But CDs don't age, so pick this sucker up. It really doesn't get much better
This product is difficult to use and does not clearly cover the scratches on the lenses as advertised.  There are bubbles in the product that do not clear up as it dries.  I do not recommend this!  Just get new glasses
We just had our son in January and we couldn't resist these cute little shoes. Even though he's only 3 months old we can't wait to see our little guy in them. What a well made product!
In the ad, this cable charger claims to sync and charge but will not hotsync to my Treo. It will charge but I already have a home and a car charger so it serves me no purpose. Falsely calims to sync
The lady can sing, but her "Christian" message is compromised because of her part in "Chasing Papi", where she played a woman who - had she had the chance - would have hopped into bed with her on-screen boyfriend prior to marriage.  It's "Crystal Clear" to me that Jaci broke my heart in a million pieces when she played that part.  It's really tragic to see such a beautiful young lady with such a opowerful voice and message now reduced to nothing more than a hypocritical wannabee, much in the same way that Stacie Orrico is now becoming.....and is it just me, or is it coincidence that these two womens' album covers look strikingly similar?  It appears their paths in life are similar, too: compromising a message and a stand that once set them worlds apart.  As with a recent review of Orrico that I made, I'll give Jaci Velasquez her due:  she can sing, and what I mean by that is sing the roof off of a house!  This album was excellent.....was.  Now, whenever I think or hear of Jaci Velasquez, I can only think one word:  HYPOCRITE
To be quite honest, although there was a stunning cast, the plot was gory. It was sweet and had it's element of romance, but it was too morbid for me to enjoy. If you are watching for Drew Barrymore, don't bother. she only  appears halfway through the movie and then only sporadically afterwards.  Dean Cain on the other hand looks mighty fine, if you're after a gay man.  It's not the type of movie you want your children to watch. Trust me
Don't waste your money.  I bought two of these.  A few weeks later several moles tunneled within 10 feet of the one in the same places as last year.  I put one in my gardern - a few weeks later a mole tunneled right alongside the molechaser as if to see what it was to his delight!  Total waste of money like everthing else I've tried except Nash loop traps
This Tea gives you the flavor of the Japanese Way of Tea Ceremony. --- A beautiful fragrance and taste. --- Be sure to prepare it in the traditional way. ---  --- Arigato to Maeda-En.  A Great Matcha. ---  --- Ron
Please think this DVD is recorded in 1986. More worse, this is recorded as a documentary. Sound quality is worst. After I bought this and DVD of "Company" (same, worst sound quality DOCUMENTARY), I suspect the word "concert" or "soundtrack" in DVD title
This years madden wasn't worth all this hype over. I have every madden so far and this one was no different than last years game. Graphics are o.k,gameplay gets repeditive at points and it doesn't have the true madden gameplay as before. It's just ok not super and semi dissapointing. The things that caught me off guard was Vince Young and Reggie Bush arent starters so you have to do that on your own by going to rosters and actually making them right!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Overall i wasnt amazed. Also the worst part is the new controls. You need to use the right analog stick to juke, spin and do shake n' bake moves. ---  --- please agree with me people!!!!!!!!!!!!
I don't see the difference between these bodysuits and the more expensive ones.  Fits my boy just right
Got a deal on the machine, and love the concept.  But every senseo coffee I have tasted has been absolutely horrible.  I've tried 4 oz with one pod- way too bitter so 8 oz with 1 pod...still the most awful coffee I've ever had.  Normally I drink Gevalia, but I use Folgers sometimes or Millstone... --- I don't think I could drink this stuff on a regular basis if someone paid me.  Of all the purchases I've made at Amazon, this has been the first time I've ever felt compelled to give feedback.  That in itself speaks volumes
i like guru because it has a more natural feeling towards your body. after drinking monster all day, my body felt like a mess(from the many unnatural chemicals it does to your body).  There are so many energy drinks out there that have loads of chemicals, its harder to find stuff like guru and bawls. 
I was so disappointed in this film. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the heart and soul Terrance Howard put into his acting. I love Terrance, he is an outstanding actor but seeing him playing a pimp was just embarrassing. He did an excellent job with the acting but I would have much rather seen him portraying Marvin Gaye. Call me naive but is pimping still actually going on in Memphis, Tennessee in this day and time? And did Terrance Howard give Ludacris' character a cassette tape to listen to? Not a CD, a tape. I probably would have flushed it down the toilet too. And the hook to that song, "You know it's hard out here for a pimp." Ya think? With prostitution being illegal in the state of Tennessee and all. I found myself cringing and sliding down in my seat in the theatre when she began to sing because I was so embarrassed. Don't get me wrong, I love my black people but sometimes when we get a chance to make a major motion picture we just don't quite bring it, do we? "The Cookout" "How High?" "Girl 6" "Woo" "Kingdom Come" Now we can add "Hustle and Flow" to the list. I'm glad Terrance Howard redeemed himself in "Crash." Do yourself a favor and pass on this one.
Last month,Feb.10, I ordered one box this wipes. But when I opened it today, all bag showed the exp.12/31/2006. I am wondering how to contact them
I thoroughly enjoy this collection of hits from The Mamas and the Papas. Every song is fun and the tunes will stay with you long after you're done listening. ---  --- Like other selections from the 20th Century Masters series, this can't be called a complete collection. However, what is included is fantastic and I find myself popping it into my CD player much more often than many other CDs. ---  --- My copy of this CD (which I bought new) includes an 8-page folder with two photos of the band (besides the cover photo), a short band biography written by Joseph F. Laredo, and a track listing with song writing and original release credits. Song lyrics are not included. The jewel case is fully transparent with another photo of the band on the inside of the back paper. ---  --- As a side note, if you are a fan of the ABC television series "Lost" this CD includes the Mama Cass song "Make Your Own Kind Of Music" that is featured on Desmond's record player in the hatch. ---  --- If you're just starting with The Mamas and the Papas, or simply want a brief overview of some of their better known songs, this is a great CD. ---  --- For more The Mamas and the Papas, check out Criterion's phenomenal DVD release of Monterey Pop (or the box set The Complete Monterey Pop Festival). This concert DVD is absolutely brilliant, and includes several songs from The Mamas and the Papas.
PRIVATE RESORT is the kind of movie that was geared towards young adult audiences in the mid-80s when sexual awareness and exposition were the hot ticket in theatres.  However, I'm sure this film is one that Johnny Depp, Hector Elizondo and Rob Morrow aren't proud to have on their resume. --- The movie's plot is slim, and neither Morrow or Depp have any screen presence in this early stage of their careers.  Elizondo tries gamely and pulls off a few laughs, but he's not at his best either.  Most of the film's laughs come from Leslie Hope as a slightly off kilter cosmic bimbo; Dody Goodman as a dotty old lady who knows karate and Tony Azito as a bumbling hotel security guard.  There's lots of slapstick, some of it works, most of it doesn't.  You can do better, folks
Sorry, this guy's voice gave me the creeps. He sounds like a preacher. Who can meditate without the ability to respond positively to the  leading   voice

I'm sorry to give this a poor review, but tea has to taste good in order for me to drink it. I often drink a large variety of bedtime teas and have never tasted any tea this awful. I can't speak for how well it works because I couldn't drink the whole cup even though I attempted to force myself. Yogi makes some good teas, but this I just couldn't stomach.
What is this all about.  I have not ordered this item nor do I have it.  Please reply
My son loves the backback and the spacious room for he has for all the engineering books he needs for class
I was ecstatic when I received this magazine subscription as as gift. Two issues into my subscription it stopped. I was really anticipating the December issue because I had many guests coming and could use some of Martha's helpful advice, however it never came and neither did January or February. I have called Martha Stewart Living magazine twice and while they are very nice and apologetic, I still have not received another issue. When I asked to cancel for a refund I was given a phone number with an automated system that uses a credit card account look up - being that it was a gift this is useless. Very clever for Martha and very frustrating for the giftee/consumer
The author writes a book that does give you a mental workout while giving valuable insight into the theological/philosophical foundations of the emerging confession. There is value in that. I look forward to reading part two, the liturgical ideas section. The emerging church is keen on praxis, but the theological underpinings of this book in part one reminds me of past mistakes within Christendom, which I had hoped we were past.  --- Here are some things that I am amazed do not occur to the others reviewing this book, which it might help to know: ---  --- 1. Rollins does not think it's possible to really "know" much theology with "certainty." In fact, to claim to have religious certainty is to hold an "idolatrous" view of God that is more our idea of God than really who God is. This is because it is virtually impossible to be objective for us humans, and because in his view, God was not all that interested in presenting much of Himself in any sort of nailed down way.  The irony I could not miss was the dogmatism with which he himself expresses his own views. --- He is very certain of his interpretations of "perceptive thinkers like Nietzsche, Freud, and Marx," Eckhart, Augustine, etc... and is very certain that his interpretations of the scattered verses from Scripture are correct. I found his use of proof texting for his ideas to be really, really, faulty. As I'm reading along I kept jotting in the margins all the times what he said was a really pretty clear misunderstanding of the New Testament. So, be prepared for a frustrating read if you know the Bible's basic content.  He is certain that no one should be certain, but him. Ok, to be fair, he is not certain if Christianity is true, and says so on page 44, but he is certain that he should not be certain of Christianity. Nor, I guess, should you. With his view of "critique of ideology" how can he be so selective of what he is certain of. This seems like a self-defeating ideology.  --- So strong is his disdain for "knowing" with any real certainty that he would do away with apologetics as if it were no longer appropriate to try to base our beliefs on reason at all. I was reminded of the case Francis Schaeffer made quite well regarding those who do not have any reason to believe something is true, but who take a leap of faith and believe it anyway. Rollins needs to reread his Francis Schaeffer, in my opinion.  --- He says the church is not to be about giving answers, but helping raise in people: questioning. Indeed, given his views, how could he provide answers? This book may look deep. I propose, it is merely muddy. ---  --- 2. He redefines age old terms. Orthodoxy is no longer about the content of what one believes, but how loosely one holds it. Certainty of revealed truth is dangerous, misinformed, idolatrous. Heresy is now a cute little thing. It has come of age. He says people will think his views undermine Christianity. We are to just take him at his word that his views won't do so, but he does not really make affirmations to give any reasonable comfort and any one would, I think, see the writing on the wall. ---   --- 3. He seems to think the emerging church is the only hope for unity or evangelism in our time among post moderns. After reading his views I wonder if it is possible for post moderns, those like himself, at least, to even understand the gospel. He has not. How can he be a bridge? To be a bridge one must have footing on both shores. Christianity IS based on real events with real content that has been passed down, not without mystery, nor without debate, but in a very real and tangible way. he cannot be a bridge to something by changing that thing to something else. ---   --- 4. He is right to be kind to people of other religions and to try to learn from them. The problem that is huge, and no one seems to notice, is that he seems incapable of learning or appreciating the Christians who are in other camps. He considers fundamentalists,and by logical extension many evangelicals, to be pharisees and the true heretics in his new definition of the term, heresy. I kept thinking, what kind of "fundamentalists" is he so angry at? He blasts the whole of that group and by extension most evangelicals, making generalizations that are misleading. Very unobjective. Unkind. Very divisive. Yet he thinks only his views can bring unity to Christendom. I can see his views bringing unity to all religions, but it will never bring unity to Christendom. He seems oblivious to the amazing amount of unity that now exists in Christendom. Times have really changed in the past 20 years. He is either unaware or has a different kind of unity in mind.  ---  --- 5. He makes God hopelessly difficult. God wanted, it seems, to speak in a plain brown wrapper...the common language of the people, the dust of humanity, the lowly donkey ride, the obscure but simple truth of the simple gospel. Rollins has wrapped God up in Nietzsche and while disdaining "human reason" as the means of knowing God has turned the living Christ who said "I am the truth" into an enigma of mental gymnastics that is so complex only man could concoct it. God's message is simple. It's clear where it needs to be. It hints at huge mystery beyond what is stated. Rollins makes it nearly all enigma, hinting at some possible truth out there from a winking God, who says out of one side of his mouth something is important and that we will be held accountable for knowing and obeying it, yet Who has been unwilling or incapable, given man's weaknesses, or His own lack of communication skills, to articulate it in such a way that a person can hold any theological content soundly. --- If, as Tickle says, this is the Christianity of the 3rd millenium, then the Chrisitan faith is about to become the irrational man's religion, the anything goes religion, and following generations will have to deconstruct today's extreme and irrational over-reaction to fundamentalism. Peter, I can learn some stuff from you, and I'm sure some of my perception of what you were trying to say was likely lost in transmission. As it stands now I cannot agree with you on several points. Your views trouble me. Nothing against you personally.  Forgive any kind of perceived condescending tone. I hope to enjoy the rest of your book much more, though, it will for me be an upper story with out a first floor. Regardless, if it inspires I'll come back and add a star. hmmm
I wore out my tape of Cypress.  Afoot is great, but Cypress is amazing.  I bought this while stationed in the Army.  There weren't too many "new wave" tapes available at the PX, and I wasn't going to listen to Def Leppard or Bon Jovi.  So I bought Cypress. ---  --- One of those rare tapes that I bought 20 years ago and still listen to every few months (The Jam's Snap and Setting Sons, and The Smith's Hatful of Hollow are 3 other tapes I never tired of).  ---  --- Get this CD.  Get it now!   It is great.   Thanks for reissuing it.
I've found the Omron very easy and practical to use.  It gives very good estimates of body fat percentages and BMI (body mass index) which can easily be used to illustrate a personal rate of progress for any dietary or weight training program.  For the money, it would be difficult to find something better
I was happy with the noise canceling features, not the best but definitely works.  Great for airplane rides - really helps cut out that background engine noise.  My problem however with these headphones hwoever is the design - the first set i had brok near the earpiece hinge and was replaced by Targus (cheers to them).  the second set broke too in a different place - the deisgn of these just isn't very sturdy.  I'm gentle with my stuff too, so either I had bad luck w/two defective units or they're just not made well
This device is great for carriying around with your camera, you can review and share the pictures with any PC with USB available, data can also be recorded and easily recovered.
I have a PowerBook, an iMac, and an eMac at home that are used in different ways. The kids use the eMac for school work, and my wife & I use the other 2 Macs for home business. ---  --- Although most school work was required in MS-PowerPoint or MS-Word, exporting from iWork '06 Pages and Keynote was very simple to do with 90-95% accuracy. Our kids said they just do minor editing at school before submitting the work. ---  --- For home business, we use Pages to do our proposals, bills, and receipts. And use Keynote for presentations. One thing that I thought was amazing, is the fact that I can display the notes and the succeeding slide on my PowerBook, while projecting just the current slide for the customer to see.  ---  --- For the price of the Family Pack, we were licensed to use iWork '06 on 5 Macs on the same network. The cost fitted our budget perfectly. The only thing I wish was available in Keynote was timed transition (example: after 3 seconds show bullet#1, after 5 seconds show bullet#2, after 2 seconds show the chart
I ordered the Cisco Aironet 1231 the other day, and after it arrived, set it up, and...couldn't get a wireless signal. I called customer support and was told I would be called back by a technician (which obviously the first person was not) within an hour. We waited...and got online to try to figure things out. Turns out that in VERY small print on an obscure documentation page of the 1231 it says at the very bottom that two external antennae are needed for the 2.4 GH wireless (802.11b/g) to work. I was even more disappointed to find out that the required antennae were available online for only $16 a piece, which makes Cisco look really cheap for not including such a small but vital item with a $500 router. ---  --- Although it took an astonishing twelve hours for customer support to get back to me, since I registered my complaint with them they have been very helpful. I really hope that they improve their web site-it really is not that helpful since you have to weed through pages of documentation before you can even begin to find information you need. I still haven't used this router since I'm waiting for the required antennae I had to order somewhere else. Cisco routers are supposed to be good, but as a warning to you, the potential customer, be aware that 1) you need to purchase external antennae with this product; 2) my initial experience with customer service was pretty disappointing
I bought the software some months ago.  Noticed some problems with my PC in subsequent weeks. Didn't put 2 and 2 together.  Last week however, I'd come home - no icons on screen - no ability to Ctrl-Alt_Del - each day this would happen. The machine had to be powered on and off to reboot. Pulled recent software off machine. Yes - you've guessed - without Spy Sweeper I have no problems. OK - it might be a conflict with other software - a quick Google confirmed my suspicions that others have problems. I was never impressed that it was picking up anything of substance either - but then maybe my machine is clean
owned a different brand that was noisy and only worked for about a month......this winder i can not hear it run and have had it a couple of months....it is still running like clock work......would recommend to anyone that doesnt want to pay an arm and leg for one.....
The story of "Hansel and Gretel" is more than a warning against children talking to strangers (or trying to eat their houses).  The recurring image of the forest in German fairy tales is a supernatural world where interesting things happen, while the fact the father of Hansel and Gretel is a woodcutter is significant because this was one of the lowliest occupations at that time.  Therefore, what we have here is the triumph of the poor working class characters over the witch and her upper class pretentions (she stores not only treasure but food), which would make her death some sort of proto-Marxist warning if you are ideologically inclined in that direction. ---  --- In the original manuscript of the story of the siblings were referred to as Little Brother and Little Sister.  The Brothers Grimm chose Hansel because it was a common name in German fairy tales (their equivalent of John Doe so to speak) and picked Gretel for essentially the same reason (which makes her Jane Doe).  Gretel (or Gretchen) is a form of the name Margaret, which in Latin (Margarita) means "pearl."   ---  --- All that background makes it rather ironic that for its Twisted Fairy Tale series McFarlane Toys has turned Gretel into a German princess, striking a pose that suggests "Getting lost in the woods is the least of her worries."  This six-inch figure has tattoos, a spiked collar around her neck, and torn fish net stockings.  There are more details for you to discover when you look over the figure carefully, and while she is not exactly a princess of bondage, Gretel appears to be familiar with the neighborhood.  She also has a mop and a pail, and there is ample reason to think she knows how to use them (the mind reels at the possibilities for rewriting the Grimms tale). ---  --- Twisted Fairy Tales is the fourth series of McFarlane's Monsters, and the rest of the menagerie consists of not only Gretel's tag team partner Hansel, but Red Riding Hood, Peter Peter Pumpkin Eater, and Little Miss Muffet.  If you were aware about the probable origins of a lot of the classic fairy tales then you already knew that Mother Goose had a twisted sense of humor.  With these figures McFarlane Toys certainly takes being twisted to the next level.  Even if you do not want the entire set, there should be one of these figures that captures the Jungian dark side of the tales that we were all raised on once upon a time that most appeals to you
This sparkling juice really holds up to the description.  It has the perfect amount of carbonation (not too much, not too little), is crisp to the taste, and is very refreshing.  The 8 oz. cans sounded pretty weak, but it turns out that one can is the perfect amount for a sitting. ---  --- Since first tasting Martinelli's sparkling apple cider at a New Year's celebration over a decade ago, I've been a huge fan of carbonated apple drinks, but none have been "just right."  Naturally, I've tasted the types that I've come across over the years, including: Martinelli's sparking cider (which is kind of sweet tasting and not generally bottled for everyday consumption), Martinelli's sparkling apple juice (a bit under-carbonated), Apple Beer (non-alcoholic, good but has a slightly odd taste), Appletiser (UK only, good, but UK only), and a few other local organic brands. ---  --- All of the aforementioned beverages are good on occasion, but seriously... none compare to essn's Sparkling Fuji Apple Juice.  Yeah, it is a little pricey, but its worth it
This pen needs gel ink to make it perfect.  The regular ink is often difficult to get flowing.  But it does the job.  PenAgain products were the only ones that caused me no pain after surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome and tennis elbow
In Touch is a weekly glossy magazines that retails at newstands for $1.99.  It is very similar to Star and Us Weekly.  They offer fodder on the Hollywood flavor of the moment, so expect lots of stories about Julia Roberts, Britney Spears, Brad Pitt, Jenifer Aniston, J.Lo and the usual suspects.  It is very worth the newstand price.  They rarely, if ever have human interest stories, most of the stories are all about celebrities, style, make-up, or fashion. They also have contests some times. A lot of times I notice they run the same stories and pictures as Us Weekly so if I had to choose between In Touch and Us Weekly 1 year subscription is less I would choose Us because it still seems like they get more exclusive stories that In Touch.  Also, some of the news they run sometimes is weeks old, I often think they end up filling space close to print time. It's an okay magazine an worth the cover price
I am a seamstress who knows how to sew, and how to thread both top and bobbin threads.  My daughter received this machine for Christmas.  We threaded it according to directions.  It sews about 10 stitches then jams.  I observe that the bobbin design is such that the bobbin wobbles within the casing, and leads to a jam every time.  Don't disappoint a child by purchasing this
I love it that card my childrens have one for your own games...
I have only used clinique eye shadows and have been so happy with them. I've tried different brands and always come back to this one. They have great colors and it lasts all day without creasing or looking too "powdery".
I bought a pack of long sleeve and pack of short sleeve onsies for my 18 month old.  Luvable Friend's onsies are awful.  The biggest issue is that they use velcro instead of snaps to secure the onesies.  And the velcro doesn't even stick.  They becomes undone and fly loose within minutes.  Also the sizing is way too large for the average 18 month old. Lastly even the shirt tag stinks. It is this cheap oversized tag that I had to cut off because it was so uncomfortable to my son.  Shame on them for making such a cheap product - shame on you if you buy these onsies after reading this review! 
This is a great laser pointer and the brighter wavelength of the green laser makes a huge difference. But to see the beam (not just the dot at the end of the beam) you need some sort of particles in the air for the light to bounce off of. Using the laser pointer with a little dust or mist in the air will make the beam clearly stand out. And if you are wondering, no matter how bright your laser is, without particles in the air you wont see the beam. At concerts where they use the big argon lasers, they always have fog machines near them to give give the laser something to bounce its light off of
I bought this product on the strength of the Norton name, and a positive review in Business Week.    I uninstalled ZoneLabs, Ad-Aware, and all Norton anti-virus.  There were still NAV files after the uninstall.  I had to download their Norton Software Removal tool, which also could not remove some NAV files.   Everytime I re-boot, those problematic NAV files want to re-launch NAV.   ---  --- The NIS 2007 install was still difficult after all of that effort, and once installed NIS 2007 either freezes up my computer, or makes my internet connection so slow that it is un-usable. ---  --- So, now I've uninstalled NIS 2007, still have issues with the corrupt NAV files, and will being go back to ZoneLabs and Ad-Aware. --- 
These boots are warm and comfortable, like my sheepskin slippers.  My feet are toasty, even when it's freezing outside.  They have a thicker sole than some other styles, which makes this boot great for walking in snow and ice.  I love the warm brown of the chestnut.  They look great!  At 50% off, the price was great, too
Hilarious from beginning to end!  Dr. Pearl er Eugene Levy, will you marry me???? 
other places where offering 4 or 5 oz for the same price. it was sent and arrived quickly, faster than expected.  great for asian recipes. good deal
My wife and I (yep a guy reviewing a kids toy!) bought this as a present for our 7 month old niece. She is absolutely hooked on it. Having a relatively short attention span with most toys, it was rewarding to see how much she likes it and how long it entertains her. Just squeezing the musical tentacles for her keeps her happy! The big doe eyes have her mesmerized as well. When she gets bored, learning to play tunes keeps the adults happy!!  ---  --- Playing is easy, you get two color coded tunes on the label and with the help of a musical friend we know a lot more now. ---  --- With my wife 4 months pregnant, we have ordered another already. ---  --- Only reason for 4 stars is the one we bought had trouble playing the lowest note (red tentacle!)
Better Homes and Gardens has been a staple in our home for years. This essential magazine seems to always be there for you. When I think about it I would say that it has enriched our home and ultimately our lives. Its very visual style of lending ideas for enhancing our domicile and our surroundings has always been simple yet effectual in enriching our lives
I purchased this program for my personal and home business tax return but it did not include all the forms needed so I had to buy another version from them. H&R TaxCut included all I needed and was 1/2 the price
My 2 year old son loves to "cook" and to serve Mommy and Daddy meals from his kitchen.  My only complaint is that it falls over easily and it seems we are often picking it up off the floor.  It isn't very sturdy, but I'm not unhappy with this purchase
i recently saw them in san francisco just like one of the other reviewers, and i thought it was astonishing. i know a lot of people got mad cause they didnt move around or anything, i mean it couldn't be because they were trying to concentrate or anything like that! the great thing about this album is that all the instruments standout at the same time. farina(the lead singer)has calmed down after the last couple of albums and often times speaks his lyrics in a soft and heartfelt way that make you wish you could get into a conversation with him right then and there.and his guitar playing has even matures after the bed is in the ocean. the drummer just flat out rocks. his punctuality is a lot of the reason why these guys are so tight. the bass speaks just as well as the guitar does and sometimes takes over as the guitar holds it together and the bassist go off on his own little excursion. well, if you have a problem with a band not rocking out, i dont know what to tell you. it is jazzy, but let me be the one to tell you this is the best jazz i've heard. i think this is the only path they could of taken. you got to evolve. sometimes that cant always be a good thing but in this case ,karate is the exception. love this
 I bought a sight from Airsplat for my son's airsoft rifle as a Christmas gift. The screws were too short to attach it to his Kitty Kat ( a shortened M-4) airsoft rifle's weaver rail. Yes, I could go out and find screws the proper length, but I though I'd make Airsplat do their job.  ---  --- So, after several e-mails with the service department, they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size. Wrong. The diameter of the new screws is so big they won't fit through the mounting bracket on the sight. Obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws.  ---  --- Why by a gun from these guys? If it arrives broken, you pay to ship it back. Want a refund? You pay a 15% restocking fee. Take a pass on Airsplat. 
I will never order an item like this again as it came destroyed! They need to repackage items like this for shipping. It it the second and the last item of this type I will order online. The other was a bassinet and it also arrived broken with the box destroyed. I have complained before but never get a response...too bad too as I like Amazon
I used it once and it charged my ipod only 80% after about four hours.  The next day I tried it again and it simply ceased functioning entirely.  This thing is garbage! 
Only the front of the bag is actually beaded, and the quality poor. The original price should have been $5 or fewer, to be reasonable. This would make a better toy for a little girl than an actual accessory
Rites of Spring is an unparalleled work of cultural and historical synthesis, and easily the most interesting cultural history of 20th Century Europe available.     
There were a few minor imperfections, but i'm overall happy with this sword.  The attention to detail and replication of Cloud's weapon are commendable
Stretchy, comfortable and made well- love this T-shirt! (Also its a slim fit and not really, really long like many are right now- more of upper hip length, which is great if you want to tuck it in!
This is a great quality product. Best quality transfer paper I've ever used. It's pretty expensive if you buy it here though. You can get this same exact product at your local Office Depot for a cheaper price plus you don't have to pay shipping/handling
I bought these stilts for my 10 year old daughter.  My other children who are 8 and 9 love them and so do all of their friends.  They are affordable and sturdy!!  I recommend them !!!
This little gizmo really does work. It seems to be pretty accurate, too, although it's tough to tell. --- You need to give it a good strong blow to get enough air through the little opening to get a good reading. I've tried using a straw to direct the air better and that seems to work. Unfortunately, there's no sensor that lets you know when it has enough air to take a reading. If there's not enough it just stays green even if there is alcohol present in your breath. Still, for the price it's pretty darned impressive. --- You'll need to experiment a bit because the instructions aren't very accurate
Why pay $46.75 for this battery when you can get the same thing made by another manufacturer (Impact) for only $19.95 at B&H Photo and Video. I have both the the DL-150 Pentax Battery that came with the camera and the Impact IMDL150. I can't tell any difference between them other than the price. Camera makers make a hugh profit on propritory items that can be obtained elsewhere at much lower prices. 
These headphones sound pretty good, but they aren't the best.  When running, the volume controller gets in the way and bounces.  It is also easy to change the volume which is annoying.  I also find the fact that the cord for the right side is longer than the other a little bit strange.  I realize it is done intentionally, but it does nothing for me.  Overall, for just listening at your desk or in your room, these are great headphones.  For running, I would recommend something else
Saw "Hart's War" the other night and couldn't really believe anyone would invest money and time in a film as awful as this one.  This film bombed at the box office and was yanked from circulation after only a few days.   Here are ten reasons why: ---  --- 1.  This film isn't "The Great Escape" and even though he would probably like to think otherwise, Bruce Willis isn't Steve McQueen.  Even though Willis received top billing, this is a Colin Farrell vehicle.  ---   --- 2.  The vast majority of the target audience of 18-34 year old moviegoing males could care less about what happened during the Reagan administration, much less World War II.  "Hart's War" may just as well be a film about a POW camp during the War of 1812.  Anything with Vin Diesel or the Rock would be bound to sell more tickets. ---  --- 3.  As far as depicting life in a POW camp, "Hart's War" is pretty much on par with "Hogan's Heroes".  The Germans are nice guys with guns who don't know very much and everyone gets away with just about anything.  Where did the GI's get all those cigarettes, anyway? ---  --- 4.  Any Stalag Luft comandant worth his weight in sauerkraut would have just as soon killed the Bruce Willis character as look at him.  As depicted in "Hart's War", the camp commandant (as portrayed by Marcel Lures) would have had a very difficult time maintaining any sort of status as an officer in the German Army.  His collection of American jazz/blues records is a cute writer's invention that has nothing to do with the reality of the situation, or of the type of men who were in charge of German POW camps.  In reality, the Marcel Lures character would probably have been relegated to another type of nazi camp with a pink triangle sewn on the front of his tunic. ---  --- 5.  The storyline is not completely unbelievable - trials did take place in POW camps, one good example being the POW's who were tried and hung in Andersonville;  However, the whole idea that the camp's commandant would actively participate in such a trial as sort of a Jerry Springer type advocate is ludicrous. ---  --- 6.  The idea that during the trial, a group of POW's who escape go on a secret mission to destroy a nearby munitions factory is insulting.  Not only did nothing like this ever happen during World War II, it degrades the bravery of those poor souls whose only act of heroism was to survive internment under harsh and sometimes brutal conditions.  The German army simply wasn't that stupid. ---  --- 7.  I saw this film once and didn't like it.  I thought that maybe the second time would be better.  It wasn't. ---  --- 8.  Beyond being sheer Hollywood political correctness, "Hart's War" seriously misrepresents many of the more important aspects of internment.  It ignores the real focus of life in such a Stalag which, for most POW's, was just day to day survival.  Also, the soldiers who served in our armed forces during World War II and also happened to be African Americans weren't spineless, hapless dopes. ---  --- 9.  Bruce Willis playing the same role in variations of "Die Hard" over and over and over again is tiring. ---  --- 10.  Better films about the same sort of subject matter are "The Tuskeegee Airmen" and "Stalag 17".  Hopefully in a few years, "Hart's War" will be completely forgotten, and these dvd's will be rotting in some landfill. ---  
Casual book browsers who stumble across Braden's book, "The Isaiah Effect," might undoubtedly be drawn to the implications of the title: that there exists some mystical, unifying code which is only now being fully understood through modern techniques, research, and understanding. I, as one such browser, had briefly read about the so-called "Bible Code" which computers have now enabled man to explore and thought that the subject of this book might be related. With my interest piqued at the title and the book description, I delved into the pages expecting to learn exactly what encompassed Isaiah's "precise instructions" of prayer. I wanted to know exactly what Braden claimed to have stumbled upon. ---  --- What I found in this 250 page foray into countless subjects was nothing other than a pastiche of new-thought concepts. The mixing of religions, for example - a sort of pick-and-choose spirituality which has slowly been creeping its way into the mainstream for decades - is recycled over and over again, drawing from endless sources of gnostic gospels and other lost books. In only one chapter does Braden actually begin to describe in detail verses from the book of Isaiah. Instead he relegates the books of the Essenes to positions of higher authority and prominence. ---  --- In the brief pages in which Braden actually does discuss Isaiah, his conclusions speak nothing of a decoded lost science. His basic premise of "The Effect" is that people can alter their futures by the choices they make in the present. Such a revelation is not a new interpretation of Isaiah at all. Any student of the Bible and Christianity knows that all the prophetic books of the Old Testament are records of God warning Israel, and the world, of turning away from Him. ---  --- To Braden's credit, his discussions of the effects of prayer in today's society are commemorable, albeit somewhat misguided. I agree with him that people in today's society need to turn away from the petty details of life with which they've surrounded themselves. However, I believe Braden over-emphasizes the role of feelings and emotion in prayer. He fails to discuss how humans, and their emotions, are extremly fallable and can change as quickly as the winds in his anecdotes. ---  --- Braden wants desperately to believe that the true power of prayer is to be found in all the lost science which he has uncovered in ancient texts. In the process he fails to recognize that the blueprint for prayer has been known to man ever since he was created. Humbleness before God and the filling of the Holy Spirit are the true keys to prayer - not cosmic emotions and human feelings. ---  --- A disappointing read
Ok, my kid loves it.  But, after seeing it in person, I cant believe how much I was charged for list little plastic toy.  Cost is way over excessive.  Strongly suggest saving your money, unless money is no object
Well  After I received the book I have to say I was quite disappointed because I am one of those people who gives great importance to presentation in the books .After I read the reviews I thought I was going to get a book with lots of nice photographs and various nicely set tables .It turned out that it was just like an encylopedia with lots of recipes and couple of boriiinggg pictures .If you are a visual person like me who likes to read cookbooks when you go to bed DONT BUY IT.The other important thing was that many important ingredients were missing in the greek food that was presented 
Collin has done it again.  I didn't think I'd enjoy a CD as much as his "The Walls Came Down," but "Tracks" is just great.  Every song is better than the last.  You can't go wrong with Collin Raye  and you can't find anyone with a better voice.  Buy this one
I am a huge fan of Thomas Newman but really this CD presents nothing new. It comes across as merely a re-hash of the airy, atmospheric, melody-free cues from his other recent scores. It has none of the originality of American Beauty or Road to Perdition. Frankly, as much as I like his scores, I don't think this warranted a CD release, it's just got too bland and ordinary, no matter how beautifully constructed and pristine it all sounds. A pity
I purchased this item thinking that it would make a nice gift, but upon receiving it found it looks and feels like something from a dollar store, and it's not even worth the dollar.   ---   Very cheezy item. ---  
There are no energy drink ingredients in this stuff. It's sugar water with a miniscule amount of vitamin C. --- A completely pathetic rip-off marketing hype which sadly is being sold as a troop supporting product.  --- Supporting the troops should not involve buying garbage sugar water at high prices. If you want an energy drink try Rockstar or Monster. If you want to support the troops buy a savings bond
Everything about the Sonos worked as advertised.  It was a snap to set up and it is slicker than I anticipated.  The interface is commonsense and well thought out.  It is the only decent solution for tying together multiple discrete sound systems within a house to play the same music simultaneously.  You can also play different music, all obtained from the same computer source or internet radio.   It is one of those rare products that instead of disappointing actually packs many pleasant surprises
Consider another receiver before buying Delorme's. Delorme's receiver works only with their software (the receiver does not conform to any standard, unlike most other receivers.) The Delorme software itself is not very accurate. Just in looking at the area of a few blocks surronding my home, I found 3 instances where a facility was shown as being located several blocks from where it actually is - but Microsoft had no problem locating the facilities properly. Finally, with the receiver I have, even after the device as been initialized, Delorme's software sometimes is unable to find it. (I suspect that is because the cable on the GPS side sometimes pulls slightly out, but fiddling with it doesn't seem to accomplish much). Real irritating out on the road, as it is when you find one of their printed atlas has been misbound and lacks several pages
I don't care what other reviewers say, but this bed rail sucked!!  I used it on my sons toddler bed since it seemed to be the only product that would accomodate that type of bed.  It took up so much mattress space that my son barely had room to sleep in his bed.  And it would constantly come unlocked.  And if I buy another bed rail for our next child it won't be a mesh one cause they get too dirty.  I can't remember if this cover was removable or not, if it was I'm sure it would have been a pain in the a** to remove
my five year old loves this . has the cutest songest and easiest lyrics to remember. So easy for a little kid.  Fun, Fun , Fu
I hate to rate this item poorly but it didn't work well for me. I installed it in my basement. It's hooked between two joists that are right under my living room floor, everytime I hit the heavy bag the living room sounds like someone is taking the place down. Solid product for the right location.
I bought two, one for me, one for my daughter. --- It is compact, user-friendly, it has nice sized screen. --- It comes with a charger (I've been told that some don't). --- 6.2 mgp. Video WITH audio. --- All this for a very nice price
You have sent me a model different from for the one that I asked!!!! --- I live in Chile ..... there is no way of returning it ......
well i bought these shoes after reading the good reviews it had got. And i was not to be disappointed. They are really awesome!! They are real comfy and fit perfectly for every sport i play. I even wear them to office sometimes ;) Though after wearing them for a long stretch of time, i did feel something in my right ankle but it was temporary and maybe that is why i dont want to rate it full 5 star. But they are worth every single penny i spent on them. ---  --- If you want to get good shoes which not only feel great but look good too, look no furthe
I bought this book when I had my first child.  It has provided me with alot of helpful information, especially at night or on the weekend when you're not sure whether or not to call the doctor.  I have worn my original  copy out and am about to buy a new one.  Many thanks to Dr. Neifert
I finally made my first purchase from Amazon's Unbox Video Downloads just to try the service and am happy to report a solid customer experience. For $1.99, I purchased and downloaded one of my favorite episodes of "The Twilight Zone", and it took about twenty minutes to download through a broadband connection. I don't think it's the most ideal way to see full-length motion pictures, but for a 26-minute classic TV program, I think my 17" LCD monitor makes for a suitable viewing experience, and the video quality of the downloaded file is clean. ---  --- Aired on September 15, 1961 as the show's third season opener, the episode is a Cold War fantasy appropriately called "Two" about the last two survivors on earth, a man and a woman, after an apocalyptic world war in 2109. Written and directed by TV veteran Montgomery Pittman, the simple plot revolves around the complicating fact that he is an American infantryman and she is an invading Russian soldier. Like two feral animals, they glare at each other among the debris of a deserted town destroyed by the war. He even knocks her out her after she aggressively throws pots and pans at him. The reality of their solitary existence, however, gradually dawns on them, especially after they see an evening dress in a shop window inspiring her to speak her only word of dialogue - "Prekrassnyi" - the Russian word for "lovely". ---  --- What really makes this episode memorable is the unlikely casting. Two years before she twitched her nose on "Bewitched", a brunette Elizabeth Montgomery, looking appropriately ravaged and sporting a deadly ray gun, plays the untrusting Russian soldier with surprising fierceness and vulnerability. The American is played by perennial tough-guy Charles Bronson, fresh from "The Magnificent Seven". Even though he has to spout some inane philosophical lines to describe the futility of war, he leavens his natural sullenness with a determined romanticism. They make an odd couple, but it works splendidly. I also learned that canned fried chicken will become a staple in the 22nd century. Narrated by Rod Serling in his inimitably halting manner, the show ends with my favorite line in his signature postscript: "This has been...a love story." This is classic TV
I purchased three of these units to mount in a utility trailer.  They did a great job on the trip of holding our bikes rock steady.   Very easy to get the bikes in and out of.  Great product
was a snap to put together, very soft for baby, moves with ease, takes some getting used to on putting the carseat in the stroller. but that's the only problem.
I have to give Philippa Gregory a big THANK YOU! for approaching this story from a different perspective from The Other Boleyn Girl.  It delves into the lives of those in poverty without straying far from the lavish lifestyles of English royalty and wealth.  Again I was attached to the characters and their struggles while learning much about the time period and historical events.  There were a few very alluring relationships between the narrator and the men she encounters creating a whirlwind of emotions for the reader but in the end, I was very pleased with the romantic outcome of the book.  So if you are deciding whether or not you'd like to read this after having read The Other Boleyn Girl, I greatly encourage you to do so, you won't regret it
I am very pleased with this product. It is good quality, easy to use, and well worth the money
this is an excellent product .  sturdier than most and very comfortable .  i like the back straps for carrying purposes .   would be nicer if it would recline fully .
i was really looking foward to watching this one as i have seen the box and looked at the reviews here,so i was upset when i watched this sad movie. gary graham(t.v.'s alien nation) is a robot jox,which means he pilots a large voltron like machine which are used as fighting weapons in a future where war is no longer fought! the f/x are not very good and the story is paper thin,only the acting is good,but it can't save this one from being just a let down. skip it
thoroughly enjoyed this product, have already watched it numerous times.  Highly recommend this to any chick fan
What a great idea, to make a documentary of violinist Hilary Hahn traveling around the world and concertizing.  Undoubtedly at the top of her profession, Hahn never fails to amaze with her unmistakably gorgeous tone, enviable precision, and brilliant musicality.  This DVD "portrait" includes personal footage of Hahn backstage at the Philharmonie in Berlin, as well as a tour at the Curtis Institute, a recording session at Abbey Road Studios, and a trip to Hong Kong.  In an age of music commercialism, Hahn is refreshingly real and self-deprecating.  Included on this DVD are excerpts from the Korngold Concerto, Mozart Sonata for Piano and Violin in G major, The Lark Ascending by Vaughan Williams, Chaconne from Partita in D minor by Bach, and the Paganini Concerto No. 1.  On the menu there is additional concerto footage, which includes the Korngold Concerto and Mozart sonata in their entirety - thank goodness, because there's nothing more aggravating than replaying excerpts.  If for nothing else, buy the DVD for these complete live recordings, because they are absolutely sublime.  The outer movements of the Korngold sound a lot like film music, which the classical music lover may or may not like, but the second movement is incredibly beautiful and highly recommended.  The Mozart sonata is also very well played, but this is nothing new as Hahn has already released a recording of this.  This DVD is important because it contains video footage of Hahn performing - the only other DVD where you can find her playing is The Last Night of the Proms, in which she plays the Mozart Concerto No. 4 in D Major and Presto from Sonata No. 1 by Bach, but the sound quality is somewhat lacking and certainly doesn't do justice to Hahn
The write up sounds good, with many options and features, but after closer examination I had to take it back. First thing, it appears that the front DV plug was an after-thought for Panasonic, it's a rinky-dink plastic flap on the opposite side of where the main AV/S plugs are located. This is often done at the last moment of production where they add a newer feature to an older designed unit, retro fitting it in wherever. The tiny "button within a button" toggle switch for fastforward, reverse, etc looks like it's glued on, it won't last long with normal use, and it's hard to use and in a bad place on the upper corner of the unit. The menu interface is difficult to navigate. The remote control is horrible, a real bad design for those who want to navigate quickly without looking closely at the buttons to figure out what button to push for each of the basic and most used features. You might want to pass on this one, remember the saying "if it sounds too good to be true, it probabily is
Very Comfortable and easy to use.  Very easy to fall asleep in, just make sure to tie yourself to something
I paid 99.00 for this little camcorder, thought it would be ideal for my action sports heros in the house, but we couldn't get the videos to transfer to the pc. The menu button would not bring anything up, so overall we just couldn't get this thing to work. A bummer of a christmas present
The Oral-B is a good product but the refills certainly aren't worth what they charge for them.  I don't know about you but it has always annoyed me when you get held hostage by a company to buy their refills for the item they sold you at a rip-off price.  They could make a great profit selling these refills at something like $2.50 each, their rip off price of $8.50 ea is beyond absurd.  The other thing is that when you buy their toothbrush they have something in there like the brush heads last 2 months.  That's a real laugh.  Even brushing just once a day, you're lucky if you get a month out of them.  So not only do they rip you off with their refill cost, they also lie to you to get you locked into their product to begin with
I was looking for a durable tape player for the kids and this was not it.  The microphone only worked for a couple of weeks.  It plays tapes ok but would have liked to play with the other features before they stopped functioning.  My kids are rough on toys but not that rough
We  bought two sets of the Alphabet Foam Play Mats - so glad we did!  We have a concrete basement floor, and now the kids have a nice, colorful, and soft place to play.  Plus, the foam floor isn't as cold as the concrete - wer're in Colorado.  The colors are great - so inviting.  The pieces fit together perfectly, and the border gives it a finished look.  Great purchase!  We'll probably buy more so that we can increase the size of the play area! 
I never received the product I ordered and need a refund immediately
If you're a professional photographer, you can probably ignore this review. But then you probably won't be thinking about buying this lens anyway, as you'll be off to purchase a nice L series. ---  --- However, if - like me - you just happen to have a nice Canon Digital Rebel camera (or equivalent) and enjoy taking decent pictures, this lens will probably work out very well for you. I've taken well over 1000 pictures with it in a couple of weeks, and it has performed very much as expected. For the price, it's perfect for a go-everywhere lens. ---  --- A few main points. Okay, it's not the best image quality. Even on low/medium ISO it seems a little grainy and its not as sharp as some of the more expensive Canon lenses. It struggles indoors unless you have a good flash unit, but for well-lit outdoor shoots it's works  very well. ---  --- Of course, it would be nice to have a nice L series with IS, but if you can't afford that then this is a very good value lens. Not for the real professionals, but great if you don't take things too seriously and just want a bit more zoom - and, let's face it, who doesn't want a but more zoom
I needed a big table to put my CPU, keyboard, screen and printer with room for papers and prints. The 8ft Lifetime table is perfect for my needs. It is sturdy, neat, attractive and portable. A must have for every home office. 
I had this set up in my daughter's crib when she was a baby.  It would light up the room just enough for her to feel comfortable but not so much that it kept her awake.  The music is very soothing and not as cartoony as you would think.  The unit would turn itself off after a period of time so I wouldn't have to creep back into the room hoping not to wake her. ---  --- This is a wonderful crib toy.  I would recommend it for any newborn, especially those who have a hard time falling asleep
I recently purchased this shoe after a friend of mine recommended ASICS shoes to me. This is my first pair of running shoes and I am very pleased with it. The shoes were very comfortable from the day one.  ---  --- One comment that I have about the shoe is that they are quite narrow in the front. I have wide feet and would have prefferred a little wider shoe. I worked out fine for me, however, because I had purchased 1/2 size longer than what I usually wear.  ---  --- Overall, I am very happy with this pair and would recommend it
I have tried nearly all brands of energy bars.  Hooah! are the best tasting and they give me the most energ
I really liked the outside design of the book. A lot of books were "cartoonish" and really was drawn to the look of the book. I wish the book did not have so much random fill-in pages. I had hoped that it would have blanks to fill in for different events/ages of the child. But all in all I am pleased with it. I would most likely buy again
Excellent product. Works well. --- Only problem is that the container holding water could be bigger
I think this a great product. First one lasted over a year and it runs 24/7, even in the winter
The author gives vague advice, the "calm down", "be objective" cliche  advice. If you don't believe me, I'm literally quoting him. ---  --- Although the author tries to make his book seem original, as you can read, it's not merely about imagining yourself in positive circumstances, but mixed with the generic advice I mentioned. This is not something revolutionary, this is rehash. Save your money and go imagine yourself in a positive situation, you don't need to read hundreds of pages to do it, or spend $ on what to imagine
I recently purchased this clock and it's a great little clock! The time and temp are cool features as well as the projection which is very cool and useful. The projection (usually on the ceiling) is not too bright to hurt your eyes when sleeping or awakening. ---  --- The only problem with the projection is that unless you have the clock on the side the numbers project upside down. I mean to say that if you have it facing you straight ahead the numbers will be above the clock upside down.  ---  --- The atomic feature was a bit tricky also. I live in central NJ and when setting up the clock for the first time it didn't pick up any signal. After I searched for a signal, took the batteries out and tried everything I knew and everything the manual mentioned it wouldn't get a signal. So I had to write an email to the company and they sent me a response with several suggestions, the one that worked and was most useful was to search for a signal (by pressing the down arrow) and then while its searching place it where it can recieve full signal, which is shown by the meter on the left, like a cell phone. Once you get enough signal let it sit there until it sets itself (you may need to take it outside)...this can take from 10 mins to days. In my case it took about 5 mins. So it set the signal and the company says once it sets you can put it where you want and it will keep the signal. Other than that problem, which is fixed, the clock is hassle free and very easy to use.i highly recommend it. Oregon Scientific was also helpful and I sent them a thank you email stressing that they need to put more signal suggestions in the manual, because if they did I wouldn't have needed to bother email the customer service. Hopefully most people didn't give up that easily and kept trying to get the signal to set if they didn't they may have returned the clock needlessly. ---  --- The alarm is loud enough for me to awaken and the snooze button is useful and on the top so it's can be reached easily in a drowsy stupor. ---  --- Overall it's a cute, useful, and stylish clock.
I purchased this crystal case to protect my new slvr L7.  It doesn't fit.  The case is not wide enough to fit together over the phone.  Don't waste your money.
I bought this bag for a 7 day bivouac hunt in the North Dakota Badlands. The average nightly temps were 40-50 F. The bag was warm during these windy and chilly nights. The bag compresses down reasonably small and is relatively light weight. On my second night of the hunt, I was zipping up the bag and the zipper broke right off of the bag. It didn't just come off, it literally broke. There was no way to fix this in the back country. I had my hunting buddy wrap some duct tape around me at night and then unwrap me like a giant tamalie every morning. He spent big $$$ for his bag and of course, had zero problems with it. Oh well, for the price and free shipping, this isn't too bad of a deal, just remember to bring plenty of duct tape with you.
The suction cups do not work on many toilet seats. Though the idea is great, save your money unless you have some to burn
i pruchased the 3 computer product.  I installed and have been in email tag with norton support ever since. My computer will not shutdown after installation. They have no idea why.  I have been through the same protocols over and over again for over three weeks.  I was finally told that installing version 7.02 would fix it for sure.  I did and it did not.   --- I was also told that unlike other products such as webroot, when you buy a three ciomputer pack, then expiration date is tied to installation on the first computer. If the three computers do not have the same installation date-like mine -i had 2006 installed on three computers which were put on at different times-you can lose the value of the subscription.  When I called Norton customer service -i get the reply that what can you expect we gave you a bargain-about 70 on a three computer deal.  The service was rude and not helpful.  I asked why it did not say anthing on the box or in the manual and was told that was my proble,
The daughter of a prominent Boston doctor is dead, apparently from a botched abortion (which was illegal in the late 60's).  Dr. John Berry's friend, Art Lee, is in jail for the crime, which he says he didn't commit.  So, Dr. Berry sets out to prove his friend's innocence, and runs into cover-ups and lots of secrets.  But there are many doubts, such as was the girl really pregnant, and did Dr. Lee actually perform the surgery, and why is Dr. Berry so interested in finding the culprit? ---  --- For Michael Crichton's first novel, it's not bad, but nowhere near as good as some later ones.  The plot is marginally interesting, but it was hard to keep characters straight and the dialog didn't sound very natural.  Dr. Berry (who just takes the whole work week off to investigate) talks more like a cheesy "private eye" than a doctor.  Also annoying was the use of footnotes and endnotes to explain various medical terms and concepts - nice to know but annoying to look up
I purchased this hair dryer for an unusual reason:  my old 1875 watt Conair was actually too much wattage for my bathroom (the circuit kept tripping), so I was actually looking for a dryer with LESS wattage.  However, I didn't want to sacrifice power, as I hoped not to have to devote any additional drying time to my shoulder-length hair. ---  --- So far, I've been pleased with this hair dryer.  It does seem a bit louder than my previous model--not obnoxiously so, just a higher, more concentrated fan noise.  The dryer is extremely light and compact; it's actually smaller than my folding travel dryer.  It is very basic, with a choice of high/low settings only (there is no heat/cool option), but it seems to dry my hair just as efficiently as my old higher-wattage dryer.   ---  --- Overall, this is a very good basic hair dryer which gives you a wide variety of use options for a great price
The POWER-2000 XP-333 charges batteries in pairs, with one LED per pair, not as described.  The XP-555 charges each battery independently and slightly faster (3 vs 4 hours).  The XP-333 charger is very lightweight, the XP-555 is slightly heavier.   They work on 110 or 220 V and includes plug adaptors for round European type plugs.  I have used the XP-333 in the USA and overseas.  POWER-2000 makes several other charger models as well.   ---  --- The XP-333 and 555 AAs are 2500 mAh, and there are XP-33327 and XP-55527 versions now available with 2700 mAh batteries.  AAA batteries charge faster as they hold less charge.  AAAs from Power-2000 currently come in 850 and 1000 mAh capacities.   ---  --- I believe that these capacities for AA and AAA from POWER-2000 and other NiMH makers are twice as great or maybe more than alkalines.  As I recall, some years ago Duracell copper top AAs have 1100 mAh.  I have not found recent figures on the web, but got the old figure by calling the 800 number on the Duracell packages.  Duracell Ultras appear to have a bit higher mAh figure, but I do not know that that is.   ---  --- The 1.2 V for NiMH vs 1.5 V for alkalines seems to make no practical difference as I am told, and I believe it is correct, that alkaline voltage drops rapidly under 1.5 V after initial use while I understand that the NiMH holds its 1.2 V value for some time. 
I usually wear a men's medium waist for athletic shorts (Umbro, Adidas, Nike) and they usually fall just above my knee lengthwise.  Just to be safe I ordered a large.  The shorts barely made it past the midpoint of my thigh and my legs aren't overly long.  The waist fits well but if you're looking for a pair of workout shorts, I'd skip these unless you like to show a lot of leg. 
This was a stocking stuffer for Christmas.  My Grandson loved it and it is performing well
This was the most disgusting diet product I've tried.  I love marshmallow dip, and this wasn't even close to tasting like it.  It has a chemical taste, like you're eating spun plastic, and makes you actually scared to eat it.  Why even bother eating it.  I'll stick with fat free whipped topping -- at least it has flavor
This compass is better than I thought it would be especially for the price.  It's a great deal.  I purchased it for a car and it work well for it
Allright, thuis gun is so much more than i was hoping for. its accurate, and its an incredible price. its pretty hard hitting. i was putting holes in a cardboad box from 50 feet away. --- im not new to airsoft, and i really wish that my first gun was as nice as this one --- if you take it out to have a little fight with your friends, i reccommend extra clips. --- the mag capacity is about 45, and the load time is annoyingly long --- a very good gun for all abilitie
I wear this shirt waiting tables and I reccomend it to anyone.  When washed it is wrinkle free and can survive many washings.  The larger size is very roomy and sleeve length is appropriate for long arms.  I only wish it came in a broad collar instead of just a point color, but still an excellent shirt
These should not be confused with dessert.  As the name states, these are a breakfast cookie, originally developed for people in a hurry who do not stop for a cooked meal.  This variety has chocolate chunks but is not a chocolate cookie.  Other varieties are available.  Cookie varieties are based on the original recipe.  They are available in the full 3 ounce size, or as mini-cookies.  They have a good nutritional balance.  They do have an expiration date.  Like all bakery products, they do not stay fresh forever.  As other reviewers have warned, you need to check the expiration date, especially if you are not buying them direct from the bakery.  Day old bread is also sold at bargain prices, but you get day old bread.  I found that the fresh cookies are yummy and they do fill you up.  I would recommend them for your travel bags (better than airline food which has often been reduced to yucky box lunches), for your desk drawer if you get busy and have to skip lunch, or for a convenient trail food if you are hiking.  I used the Rocky Road variety (seasonal special) in Christmas stockings and the pumpkin variety (seasonal special) in Halloween bags
I love these!  They are such a good deal for the price, and come in a nice box.  They are much better than what I was expecting. : )  Colours are a nice pastel, and would go with lots of different things.  Pearls are large but not too large - just right
Attempted to upgrade from 97 to 2003... bad move... none of my access 97 programs work now... in fact I, I brought home a 2003 access database from work to see if it was an incampatibility problem between the two versions... nope... the upgrade just didn't work.....had to purchase a full version to set things right... save your money on this product..
Poor product.  No strap comes with this case.  Too difficult to get the iPod out for updates, whilst trying to pull out iPod can be dropped.  Front view cover is smeary and scratched.  Buttons are difficult to re-snap.  No need for other voting on this --just a poor product
My daughter at U of M got me interested in the Rwandan crisis and was just vacationing in Canada and picked up this book by a Canadian General who was leading the UN effort in Rwanda during the genocide and what a tragedy this  was and remains. I didnt walk away thinking this guy was a great General but he had the guts and the commitment to right to stay in spite of the ineptitude of the United Nations and Cofi Anan who was in a key role at the time. The tragedy of what the free world stood by and let happen is nearly unsurpassed, probably only by the Jews extermination in WWII. If you have any interest in the world happenings and think you have faith in the United Nations just buy this and read it - we need change.
With no mode settings(repeat, shuffle, etc) or shock protection, this cd player is pretty undesirable, but if you're just looking for something to hold you over then this'll do. It has all the basic features of a cd player of course and it works alright. It could be with just mine, but every pair of headphones, new and old, that I use with it, the left begins to malfunction although when using those same headphones in another cd player or speakers, they work fine. Like I said, if you just want a temporary thing then I guess this is good for you
Hasta este momento ha sido una experiencia muy favorable, pues el reloj ha funcionado perfectamente y el tiempo de entrega estuvo dentro de mis expectativas. --- 
I had been using my air conditioning vents to hold my XM radio and this was recommended to me through a friend.  It's super easy to install and works great.  It doesn't move or shake while driving and is adjustable height wise to fit most car setups.  It was well worth the money and in the summer heat, I am glad I bought it and got my extra air conditioning vent back
I like the fact that Kidsline offers extra crib sheets to go with the Zanzibar theme and am impressed with the quality of these sheets (I have two, one came with the bedding set and one was purchased off my baby registry) . They wash extremely well (still looks new), are soft and fit the mattress appropriately. However, I think $16.99 for a crib sheet is a bit pricey and have purchased other crib sheets that match the theme and are just as nice. (Amy coe, sage green at Target for $8.99 and koala baby sage green for $9.99 at BRU).  Since you need several crib sheets, I just don't feel the price is worth it for this one.
Just to warn you, this product does not come with a USB cable and it doesn't work with most laptops I have had.  You need a desktop for this product and the website for the product is not very helpful at all.  The ecaddy is great, but the caddylink is next to worthless
This movie helps brings to life what you have read in the Bible about John and future world events. You must see this movie
Having read Detective Comics #471-479 in the 70s done by this same creative team, I picked this up, hoping for more of the same. What a let-down!  ---  --- I have to ask - What Happened!? ---  --- The art on those erstwhile 70s issues was the finest, most detailed art I'd ever seen in a comic-book. I think that was due mostly to the inking of Terry Austin. When he was working on X-Men, he gave John Bryne's pencils that fine detail as well. ---  --- Has Austin done a 'Gil Kane' and given up his nib-and-ink to work with marker-pen? This Dark Detective series shows none of the fine-ness of his previous work. You only have to compare the 'flash-backs' of this series to the original Detective Comics issues to see that something is wrong. ---  --- Maybe Austin or Rogers are getting older, but the artwork is very basic, and lacks the sheen they used to produce. The art sometimes actually reminded me of Bob Kane's early work. ---  --- The story also is a little unbelievable. It portrays Bruce as a love-sick puppy and just doesn't ring true.  ---  --- Also, the lettering is - well, it's been hand-done, by Rogers I surmise, and is quite uneven. It should have been done by computer. ---  --- I'm sorry - I SO wanted to like this, but it's nothing like the calibre of work that this creative team produced in their glory days of the 70s. 
We bought two of these.  We were very impressed how easy the set up was. ---  --- Since installing the weather station - we have enjoyed the accuracy of the weather station both inside and outside temperatures. ---  --- One feature of this weather station is a ice alert.  Up here in north we do get freezing rain ice, and snow.  This station has been right on the --- button with those predictions. ---  --- I would highly recommend the purchase
I cant believe there are so many positive ratings given to this sub-par Testament release.  Testament must have taken hints from Metallica and tried to attract a different audience.  This is not a horrible album, but compared to any other Testament album, it is easily their worst.  Only the die-hard Testament fan, or those into commercial metal should pick this up.   --- 
I used the Remington twice up to now, and the bottom line it is a great machine, you will never need to lube it, and that is a big deal with clippers. its easy to clean, sharp and easy to work with
I agree with "music fan" about this CD. Eden is a good album, and she's a good artist. But either this album was poorly produced or something, because this does not show her best. I wouldn't classify this as world music at all, because the instruments aren't used and it's more classical pop; if that's a genre. It seemed rambly to me with many of the songs sounding similar and lacking originality. I love her, she's unique in her genre. But she really shines as a classicist, with Classics, her work by Andrew Lloyd Webber (who she married) and operatic albums. This is what she's best at, so her collaborations on Eden and La Luna, which are classical in nature but still allowed her to branch out musically, turned out good. I have a lot of her albums, but I wouldn't buy this one. It's more something to listen to once. A few of the songs are good, the album isn't terrible, but it's not very good
 The black of this is the same as on my camera, and with all the parts together, this is one professional looking set up! ---  I am not sure if this hood cuts down on glare/reflection, as I have not used it on a sunny day, but I don't see why it shouldn't. ---  And as cheap as this little product is, it is pretty much a must have with this camera! (S3 IS) ---  ---  One last side note, should you alreay own a extra lens or two. And they happen to be metal, be VERY carful about screwing them into this plastic adaptor! I made that mistake and had to put the whole thing in the fridge for an hour, so the metal would shrink, and I could get the pieces apart
This armband provides good protection to the nano via a skin that the nano slides into and a rigid clear protector that fits over the screen (stays in place by pressure from the skin pressing down on rubberized edges of the protector).  ---  --- It works well for jogging and working out. The neoprene (better than leather for sweaty workouts) armband fits well on my upper arm (6' 200lb) and seems pretty adjustable to other size arms. It is a bit awkward to silde the nano into the skin while keeping the screen protector in place. I first began sliding the nano into the armband mount but found that difficult to keep the screen protector in place so I now just clip it in which seems to work fine. It has tried to come loose from the armband a couple of times but I think this was due to not ensuring the nano was fully seated into the armband.  ---  --- I have only used the armband for about 3 weeks now and I am satisfied at this point, I am only giving 4 stars due to the screen protector being scuffed out of the package and there could have been better documentation included. Also on another note, apple should have centered the hold button on the top of the nano because almost all protectors I have seen make it somewhat difficult to access the button and this one is no exception. The button is next to the upper left edge and any decent protector has to almost cover this area to work properly.  ---  --- All in all you will be satisfied with the armband and remember for the price your are getting a skin for everday protection of the nano and a good armband also so it's a solid value.
I do not have any recolection of purchasing this product, nor can I find it on my computer or in any of my hard non computer files. I have always ordered a hard disk back up of all purchases from Zone Alarm. There is no hard disk no Computer file. I am about to raise you Know what about this charge on my credit card. I will challenge it if I do not receive for what I am being charged. I will also ask My credit card Co. for a new number to prevent future charges from these folks. In the future I will use a third party encryted method for purchases on the internet.  rehadik@netscape  
Van Dyke Parks did the arrangements on Sam Phillips's debut 'The Indescribable Wow', an album I love so much I thought I'd give 'Song Cycle' a shot. ---  --- What a feeerocious disappointment! I'd give it zero stars if I could, but amazon wouldn't let me! ---   --- My god, that singing voice of his reminds me of David Bowie... "The Laughing Gnome" Bowie, that is... I've seen the word "coy" pop up in a lot of reviews to describe his singing, er, style, but I'll go them all one better... "smug". All I hear in it is "Ooh, I'm so smart. What a clever lad am I."  ---  --- The arrangements or orchestrations, or whatever you call them are all pointless. It gives me the feeling that Van's dad bought him an orchestra and said, "Here, son, have fun." So young Van did... without ever really learning how to use it properly. Randy Newman KNOWS how to use an orchestra; check out his best album 'Sail Away'. The arrangements are tasteful and, key word here, SPARE. He never clubs us over the head with them.  ---  --- The lyrics, if we can call them such, have no attachment whatsoever to the music.... but then again since I wrote that the arrangments are pointless I guess it's to be expected. --- So, what we have is a trifecta of awfulness: bad voice, bad lyrics, and bad music. ---  --- HOWEVER, he did make 'Song Cycle' in 1968 and worked on 'The Indescribable Wow' in 1988... so he did learn a thing or two in 20 years, namely that arrangements are NOT songs; they're used to highlight a certain verse or chorus the singer really wants to put across to the listener... maybe Randy pulled him aside once to tell him that...
Wow!!! I bought this set a couple of months ago and I've been watching each episode little by little, and enjoying each one of them a lot!!! It's interesting to watch Captain Scarlet again, thirty-something years after the last time I watched it back in the late 60s (when I was 7 or 8 years old)! ---  --- I was (and still am) a huge fan of the "Thunderbirds" and became quite delighted when this new series from Gerry Anderson first appeared on TV back in the 60s! The quality of Captain Scarlet's special effects obviously got better since the Thunderbirds, and it really makes a huge difference (as far as realism is concerned) to have the marionettes more realistically proportioned! So much so, that there are times when you can almost forget that they are marionettes! ---  --- The production still looks fabulous after all these years! The design of vehicles, machines, personal equipment, weapons, buildings, etc. is quite enjoyable, interesting and sometimes even surprising! The "Angels" (both airplanes and pilots) still manage to look amazingly sharp and contemporary!!! Perhaps only the automobiles give you a hint of the series real age, for they look quite dated indeed! However, now it seems a bit funny to see 1965 Chrysler and Ford lookalikes among the futuristic modernism of the series! ---  --- Thirty-something years later, most of the episodes plots seem a bit shallow, almost stupid! But one has to remember that this series was meant for children! So, once you remember this you'll be ready to have a great time watching Captain Scarlet and his fellow Spectrum buddies fight the evil Mysterons (led by the sinister looking Captain Black), just as you did when you were still a child! ---  --- Spectrum is green!!!...Enjoy it!!
This game has StarForce copy protection, which is software that you do not want on your computer. Reportedly, it replaces your CD and/or DVD drivers, and often causes extreme hardware and software problems. I've been a victim of the software problems, it basically crippled my very expensive SCSI scanners and it was extremely difficult to figure out what was doing it. It could be the best game that's ever been produced, but anyone who's had the StarForce experience is going to steer clear
We had the Royal for about 8 months, used it sparingly and made sure not to overload it the it stopped working.  We read reviews prior to purchase and it was recommended then to find other reviews now that support our experience.  Stay away from this shredder.  --- 
This storage bench is great for storing pool items or anything you keep outside.  It was easy to put together and I got it on the Friday sale for $69.99, so the price was awesome!  All other benches like this that I researched were over $100.0
Warmth from window affects thermometer! D'oh! It's totally inaccurate on single-pane glazing, very inaccurate on dual-pane glazing, and still slightly inaccurate when mounted on a jerri-rigged 6" extender from dual-pane glass. The nature of windows being a big source of heat loss means this thermometer is measuring *warm* ambient air, not actual outside temperature
I own both Blu-ray and HD-DVD movies, and have been consistently dissapointed with all the HD-DVD's.  They just don't compare to Blu-ray.  The Hulk was not a very good movie to begin with, and the transer to HD-DVD was not impressive.  Picture quality was average at best, and the sound quality was also mediocre.  I have yet to find any HD-DVD that is even comparable to the best of Blu-ray
 I bought one pair of shoes and returned them, they were to large. Bought another pair and hoped that I would adjust to the shoe, I haven"t. I have worn the shoes now and can not return them. I plan to give them away to someone they may fit. I will never order shoes again, I learned my lesson.I agree with the other review good quality in the manufacturing poor design as far as the size.I believe rockport made a mistake with the size and fit and thats why they are being sold for a discounted price. I will go to a shoe depatment and try on the shoes before I buy, as I have in the past
I love this product.  Unfortunately, I blew mine up in West Africa (my computer was not damaged), so when I returned I ordered another right away.  I wish that it were a little thinner, but I suppose you can't have everything....at least right now
We loved this pair of sneakers for my 22 mo. old so much that we bought it in the next size up so that we/he could keep using them. They are so easy to get on him, and we all know some are SO difficult. These slide right on while pulling the tongue. They are also wide enough for his "flinstone" feet, lol. They break in well for flexibility too.
By far... the best, no after tastes and will not spike your blood surgar levels, worth every penny
Surprisingly decent sound for something in this price range!  And loud enough to fill an ordinary room with sound; hard to believe it runs off of a 9-volt battery.  You can also plug in a Walkman headset.  In contrast, the Pocket Rock-It costs more and is headset-only; no loudspeaker.  The three knobs on top are volume, tone, and distortion.  It comes with a fresh battery and it has a belt clip so you can wear it.  It's a good value and takes up very little space.  I kinda like the nostalgic pastel colors, like a blast from the past
They could not be any smaller, the diamonds or the earrings.  I should have known better
I buy this at Sam's Club for about $12/2#. Before I became enlightened re: organic products, I was a Folgers user. This coffee is a deeper roast and has a higher acid level, but is flavorful. For the price this is an incredible deal
Ok, I'll admt it. When I first saw this movie, I was only 6 or 7. I thought it dumb and pointless.I also thought 'OMFG! What was that teacup thing for? it was soooooo pointless. This movie is stupid.' Now I am 13, and i saw it again on ABC family. Then, I thought 'WOW!' this movie is so cool! I then understood what theteacups represented and everything. I thought it was a great movie. Truely hilarious too. Of course, it does teach a sort of lesson about surviving in the world. But I never found it until now. This is a very cute movie and I really think anyone can enjoy it
I received my order today, and discovered (as with all of the Hasa products in my order) that although more than one item is pictured--  only one comes with the order.  The item itself is very small, 2 1/2" X 1".  That, fine, I can accept since the cost was under two dollars and since the item is made of wood, lifesize would make play a work-out for most children. However, shipping only one without a clear statement that each order is for ONE item and does not include all the items in the photograph is false advertising
This movie has such wonderful reviews from both professional critics and Amazon customers that I was expecting great things. While I agree the acting (especially the girls playing Christy and Ariel) is excellent the story is just too implausible and I got that impression from the minute we see the family crossing from Canada to the US (yes they are Irish but for some reason they have to sneak in to the US from Canada). Anyway why on earth would an apparently intelligent couple enter the US with their two kids illegally, without jobs or much money to settle in the most expensive city in the country?  I know the dad is an actor but couldn't he have settled the family in one of the less expensive boroughs and taken the subway in to Manhattan? The mom is a teacher but can't find a job but no wonder if they are in the country illegally. Yet there is money for private school, fixing up the dump of an apartment, an expensive camcorder, betting the rent money on an ET doll etc.  I can't imagine any parents moving in to an apartment building known as the "drug house" with two young girls and then letting the girls wander about as they please.  Mind you the parents are a couple supposedly almost crippled by the guilt they feel over a third child - a son - that has recently died.  I kept expecting someone to call Social Services.   And the medical situations with both Frankie and the mom and new baby are not well thought out or researched. The symbolism between Mateo, the new baby and Frankie is very heavy handed. Though the film is told through the oldest daughter's eyes  because of several scenes and elements the movie is not suited at all to children.  And there are also several scenes that are really not connected with the oldest daughter at all.   Maybe if I had taken it more as a fable I would have "gotten" this movie more but I was expecting a straight forward drama and was disappointed.
This nail polish is by far the best nail product I have ever purchased! I stumbled accross it in France two summers ago and have been dying to find it ever since. The brush is great, depositing the polish smoothly and thinly, the product dries quickly and lasts a long time. It is AMAZING
I love the Olay Regenerist line! Moisturizes your skin and makes it smooth. You will see a big difference after the first use! I've been using this product for 2 years now and just recently started the serum and it's great.
Fantastic collection of all areas of graphic design. A must for the reference library
Great errings. I got these for my 12 y.o. neice but decided they were too long for her, but loved them for myself, very cute
With five kids under the age of 9 and four Leapsters in the house, there is rarely a time when someone isn't playing one (if not all!) of them. We have about 10 of the cartridges, and this was the most disappointing (followed closely by Spiderman). There simply isn't enough for them to do with it. The beauty of the Leapster is the ability to interact with the games, and learn while they do it. Watching a video on a 2 inch screen just doesn't cut it.
This is by far one of the very best musicals ever made. Kathryn Grayson and Howard Keel displays Oscar worthy performances as Lilli and Fred. Sadly, this was Grayson`s last MGM film and she did only 1 more(at Paramount - The Vagabond King with Oreste).  ---  --- In KISS ME KATE she shows us a depth and nuance and is right on target the whole picture through. Audrey Hepburn won that year`s Oscar for Roman Holiday - but Miss Grayson should deservedly have won it. --- The same goes for Howard Keel. True, he is hammy at times - but it is a remarkable performance he gives(Mind u - he was a musical star). William Wolden`s Oscar for Stalag 17 should have gone to Mr Keel. ---  --- That`s Entertainment and its sequels payed deservedly homage to producer Arthur Freed and his genius in selecting and delegating crew and performers to the right project were uncanny. --- Yet you shouldn`t negletct Jack Cummings who produced this film, Seven Brides For Seven Brothers and Three Little Words(to name but a few). It seems to me that MGM had an "MGM-look!" Can u really tell the MGM films from 1930-1960 apart and say which 1 was the director? Not really, unless u are Hitchcock or Fritz Lang.  ---  --- What I mean to say that it`s high time Cummings, Joe Pasternak og Sol C. Sigel comes out of the cold and are giving honours for their splendid musical efforts(Bathing Beauty, Anchors Aweigh, In the Good Old Summertime, Summer Stock, The Great Caruso, Hit The Deck and High Society etc). ---  --- I must also pay may respects to Tommy Rall(soon 2 be one of the brothers in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers); he is a dancer`s dream come true:-
Every house should have a Grundig S350 Deluxe. Big, brawny, "grabbing" in all the hard-to-get stations with ease, championing a big antenna that says this radio means serious business, the Grundig S350 Deluxe version, is a bigger, better version of the old Grundig S350, eliminating some of the "drift" problems of the earlier model. The speaker on the Deluxe is bigger and brighter. Whereas your fancy digital preset radios often sound like tin, the Grundig S350 DL has depth. Is it a perfect radio? No. You don't have presets in spite of the digital read-out. You get a little AM overload. Here in Los Angeles I get overload on 1150 so that I'm listening to two shows at once. Also the cheaper (and cheaper built) GE Superradio boasts an internal AM ferrite antenna twice the size and as a result gets slightly better AM. ---  --- If you're looking for a radio with similar features as the Grundig S350 DL but erases its weakness--no presets and AM overload, then you might want to check out the Grundig G4000A. It's the same price as the S350 and its speaker is surprisingly good for a digital preset shortwave radio. Or you might look at the stunning Kaito 1103 or its more expensive cousin the Eton E5. But even if you get a fancy preset radio, every house should have the big easy-to-use Grundig S350 Deluxe. ---  --- Update: Comparing the S350 to the same-priced G4000 for several months, it becomes clear that the G4000 is a better buy: superior AM, superior separation of AM stations, presets, same warm speaker, and smaller.
In theory this is a nice set, and I like all of the different tools -- but I bought this as a gift, and I'm going to return it.  It just looks too cheap.  The wooden handles are chipped in some places, there's almost no finish on them, and the plastic case is really flimsy and cheap looking.  Perhaps if I was buying them for myself I wouldn't mind, but I'd be embarrassed to give this as a gift
These shoes make my feet look so tiny but they are so cute!  I wore them with jeans and will wear them with a pencil skirt next week. Turns out Jessica makes pretty good shoes.........CUTE!!!
Very beautiful pearls. There are visible blemishes, which makes them appropriate to wear at work without me feeling overdressed. The uniformity is very good. All pearls are more or less same size. Beautiful clasps too. However I have to agree with the previous reviewer that it is hard to handle without help, especially the bracelet. Took me about 10 minutes to put it on my wrist. The color is slightly yellowish. The shape is good: kinda semiround rather than potato. They'll make great gifts.
Add a can of chick peas/garbonzo beans and you can give this entree 6 stars. Makes it look a bit more appealing, too
I wanted to mainly write this to address the shipping complaints below.  We are redoing our deck and expanding it, and after research thought this would be the best buy for a durable product.  After reading the shipping complaints, we put it on order right away- expecting to have it in the several weeks it would take for the deck.  Lo and behold- 3 days later they call my wife and ask to deliver it- any 4 hour window she wants- she picks the next morning and the next day when i get home there are 4 giant boxes in my garage spot when i get home.  They are huge boxes, and double boxed, but luckily no styrofoam- still i had to take all the cardboard to the recycling center myself, but at least very little was not recycleable.  Our deck is still not done, so i can make little comment other than that the one i did set up in the living room seems study- the cushion is very thick and well made- but stiff- which may be the comment noted below (I assume he goes for very soft).  I find it comfortable, but may comment more when we have actually used them a bit.  Still given the shipping concerns noted is several comments, I wanted to point out that if you have someone who can be home for a four hour window- it seems to be no problem.
I was first introduced to this tea at Starbucks. They marketed it as Shaken Passion Tea. It tastes great when served hot, but when iced, it really shines. ---  --- Bear in mind that this is a herabl infusion and not a traditional tea. The color is a deep ruby red and the taste....it is indescribable. When served slightly sweet with a spring of mint it is the perfect summer refresher. ---  --- If you want a break from traditional black or green teas or are watching your caffeiene intake this is the perfect subsitution
The sneakers are great.  My son loves the wheels on the side
Who in the world called this ''Hard Rock''?!???????????!!? This is a bunch of self-pitying, mainstream jibberish..nothing interesting at all. I shall dub this as ''Alternative Whine''.
I'm very disappointed with this magazine.  It seems to be a total waste of money.  I found one article that was somewhat helpful and sometimes 2-3 pictures in each issue that give me some style ideas, but it's not worth the money or my time digging through it trying to find something I can use. 
First of all it took like 2 weeks for then gun to get to me. 2 weeks later....the piston broke so its not a high quality airsoft gun. But it looks cool and its worth the price
Birkenstocks are a great thing for my diabetic feet.  I found this particular model to be a bit narrow to my liking
I bought this set for use with my second child. It helps to have more bottles around when she needed to go to daycare and I needed to pump. I use the bottles and different nipples to feed her and then use the bottles from this set to pump with. She did not take to the nipples that came with this set--but they are very nice and if she had it would have been perfect. The bottle hold 6 oz so once your baby is taking more than 6 oz you would not be able to use them to feed with. Overall---I am so happy with the Medela bottles and pump!!
I hate this doll!  She is difficult to program, eats batteries and the tags which must be plugged into her body do not like to stay attached.  Within a week her hair was a matted mess, it took me an hour to brush out the tangles and is now braided.  I would not recommend this doll to anyone.  With all the frustration this doll has caused I would love to turn it into a shooting target
If you want your hair to feel like it has day old elementary school vanilla pudding in your hair then this is a 5 star product for ya!  If you like your hair clean and nice, pass on this.  I tried this, and my god anything I rested my head on; chairs, car seats, pillows, my boyfriend, my child! was left with a greasy gooey stain on it.  Seriously  I think this stuff is going to cost me more in cleaning bills then anything else I have ever used on my body.  And I still have the original hair damage in my dern hair!!!  Maybe if he had killed an animal or 2 for this product I would not be left with this mess. 
The Firm(a conglomerate consisting of Nas, AZ, Foxy Brown and the relative unknown Nature(who took the place of original member Cormega after a heated dispute))...came up with the "brilliant idea" to collaborate on a full album...after the release of "Affirmative Action" from Nas' It Was Written album.  After enlisting the assistance of Dr. Dre's Aftermath Records and production by the infamous Trackmasters,  The Firm's album is subpar to say the least...it sounds like each individual artists is trying too hard to outshine the other and many of the beats consisting on this album are just a lil too sample heavy...."Hardcore" for example.  However, I will admit, there are some shining moments by all four members....and some half decent production....i.e. "Phone Tap"..."F**k Somebody Else"(lyrics are forgettable since Foxy is doing what she does best on the mic...talking about sex and its many forms....I think you might be able to masterbate to this one...LOL).  I will give this a decent try but I can't go no further than that.  I will agree with one reviewer saying that listening to the group as solo artists is a more satisfying
This book would not be helpful for children of faiths other than Christianity
I owned this camera for almost two years before someone stole it from me, and I said "THANK YOU!" because I hated the thing.  I used to have a 4mp Samsung and it was better than this one.   ---  --- The worst problem: Slow.  Slow slow slow.  If you use the flash, be prepared to wait 4-8 seconds before being able to take the next picture.  It's worse at low battery strength, but even with fresh batteries it was tedious. ---  --- The other thing that disappointed me was the color.  The light from the flash is glaring and unnatural, and without the flash everything is reddish, grainy, and blurry.  I never found a decent middle ground.  I take a lot of pictures indoors and at low light, and my Samsung wasn't great but it was better than this one.  When I look at the pictures I've uploaded on my computer, I can see the difference when my old camera died and I got the Nikon. ---  --- The worst thing about owning this camera was occasionally borrowing someone else's camera and wishing I owned THAT one. ---  --- Do some research before you make a mistake like I did. I've heard similar things from others who owned the same camera
We've used artificial Christmas trees for years and every year we've taken off the ornament, etc and broken the tree down for storage.  This year we ordered the Christmas Tree Bag.  This year, we took off the stand and set the entire tree, ornaments and all in the bag.  Only about a foot of the "trunk" stuck out after zipping up.  Where has this bag been all these years?  Next year we'll unzip, put on the stand, and set up the tree.  Plug in the lights and away we go
I put this item on my Christmas wish list....I didn't realize just how large and lovely and superior in quality it would be compared to others on the market! I've never seen a mortar and pestle like this before. It is top quality and a 'treat' to own and use
Amazon.com has listed this as the "King's Quest Compilation" instead of the "King's Quest Collection" which is clearly printed on my box for the game, as well as the picture on the website. I don't know why that is. ---  --- As for the game itself, I remember loving the King's Quest games when I was younger. I bought this game mostly for "King's Quest VI" which so far has seemed to work fine, with the exception of one time when the game kicked me out for no apparent reason. This particular version of "King's Quest VI" also seems to draw it's graphics from the original release of the game and not the CD release later on, so that was also somewhat disappointing. Captain Saladin no longer looks like Lassie. ---  --- Overall, it's nice to have access to these games for nostalgia
When I got ordered these shoes, I was so excited because the picture looked so nice. Do not be deceived by its looks. I saw it in another store, and I tried it on for fun. The shoe fits poorly, and its actually really ugly. I would definitely not reccomend it to any one
They have made several changes - some good, most bad -  since I bought my last Sony handicam in 8/2003.  First of all, there is no carrying strap.  This is very inconvenient if you plan to use your hand for anything else except for holding your camera.  I managed to jury rig one but it is a royal pain. The docking station is just one more thing to have to carry and when you want to upload your mini cassettes to your computer, you have to take the camera off the docking station to change cassettes. This messes up my editing program.  Fortunately I still have my old camera.  The ability to take still shots is better - more megapixels - but not good enough to zoom in or enlarge.  ---  --- While I was told most people prefer to use the LED screen (I don't knoiw why as it eats up more power and you can't see clearly in bright sun) I like to use the viewfinder.  It no longer has a tilt up feature so I end up mashing the battery into my cheek. ---  --- This last complaint is about the batteries. Sony LIED about the amount of time that a battery will hold.  The 5 hour battery only charges to 194 minutes on my camera. That's slightly more than 3 hours; It is nowhere near 5 hours.  The 7 hour battery does not get anywhere near 7 hours either. Their packages should be accurate.   All in all, It is not as good as the older product.  There also should be a setting to stop it from running if the rec. button is not being pushed.   THIS WILL BE MY LAST SONY UNLESS THEY MAKE MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS
This 3 Piece Combo is a good purchase.  The chargers might feel a little light weight or cheap but they work never the less and the case is of good quality.  For the price,  you can not beat it
This book expounds endlessly on how best to limit the impact of people on the backcountry in the very best traditions of the Sierra Club.  It's more of a philosophy book than a "how to" book.  If anyone wants to  learn how to backpack and/or camp, he would be better advised to buy the  several books by Karen Berger and Chris Townsend, in particular The  Backpackers Handbook
I bought one of these, based from a review. I pretty much agree with her, the machine is great and it gives a good workout. But she forgot to mention, the thing can cause your feet to get sore! I tried wearing high quality running shoes and it still hurt. I received an advice to attatch foam strips to the runners that you stand on, and that has solved the problem! So far, I have not used the pistons, so it's just a cardio workout. I have Tony's tapes he sells on his website and his music cd's, and I do get a very good workout! I have lost 13 pounds so far by using it, and I noticed it defanitely toned up the buns
Remember Spirograph by Kenner you played with as a kid? This thing Hasbro sells under the same name is NOT that toy. It is obviously of cheap quality, parred down to a handful of "gears", and designed so poorly that it doesnt really work! Stick with the original, which means purchase it used on eBay, but do NOT buy Hasbro's Spirograph.
I have used Tax Cut for several years.  Have had no complaints.  It is easy to use and is very complete.  Plan to use it again next year
The Cold Steel Spike Tanto is a lot of knife for a reasonable price. ---  --- It is viciously sharp and will remove arm hair quite easily.  It has a width across the spine of the blade that is unmatched by any knife its size I have ever seen.  Virtually indestructible.  The case is excellent if plain.  This knife leaves very wide wounds in steak; I think stitches would be the only way to close the wounds. ---  --- On the down side it doesn't hold an edge very long and its handle is very short and I wear a medium glove. ---  --- Overall this is a knife built for the sole purpose of self defense.  It is small to make it easily concealable and comes with its own neck chain.  It is a knife that won't let you down when the going gets tough, used in its intended purpose it should be virtually indestructible and wickedly efficient.   
Can't say enough about how great this record is. It still stands the test of time by remaining relevant. "Summerland," and "Mission Man" are my personal favs, but the whole album deserves raves
I was happy at the appearance of the bag, but was extremely disappointed in the smell of the backpack.  I received it around Christmas time and have had it hanging outside since hoping to air out the smell.  It still smells making it unable to use
Call it American folk, call it alt.country, call it what you like, but if you heard this Aussie trio on CBS or NPR earlier this week, suffice to say their in a category all their own.  Love that harmonica.  Up All Night by the Waifs is appropriately titled.  I'll be up all night listening to it
My bedroom receives an inordinate amount of morning light and, being a light sleeper, I've tried numerous ways to protect my slumber. It doesn't help that my husband (God love him) snores as loud as a small jet plane. I've tried silicone ear plugs and satin eye masks only to find that the plugs make me feel like I have a head cold and the masks leave unwanted gaps that let in the light. ---  --- I received the Tranquility Zone eye mask for a birthday present and I could hardly wait to try it. I LOVE this thing! It's thick and large enough to block out all of the light and, due to the design, the mask is positioned perfectly over my ears. The sounds are pleasant (I'm a big fan of the "Babbling Brook" track) and I love being able to plug my mp3 player in so I can listen to my own nature-sounds tracks, too.  ---  --- I've given this 5 stars because there's no option for 4.5. In all honesty, there are a few drawbacks. First, when I say this is thick I'm not kidding. Without my A/C in the summer it might get a bit warm. Second, the sound clips themselves are on very short loops... so if you have a brain like mine that tunes in to what you're hearing you'll notice that the clip repeats itself every 5 seconds or so. Were it not for this I'd be a bigger fan of the first track -- the one that sounds like you're in a forest -- but I get distracted (and awakened) by hearing that bird sound that comes closer then fades. ---  --- Even with these things in mind, I have to say I haven't slept this well in YEARS. I love this thing, and I wish I'd found it earlier. In fact, I love it so much I've given it as a gift to two friends who'd tried on my mask while they were visiting and fell in love with it, too
I absolutely love this hairbrush! I have curly hair and like to blow it out often and until now I have not been impressed with any brushes. This brush holds the hair in pace when blowing dry and also lets you move it with your hair and dose not hurt as some can or get stuck. You will not be sorry if you are looking for the perfect brush to go with your perfect dryer (the featherweight)! Oh another thing I like is it extremely easy to keep clean.
I cannot believe this is billed as a baby video.  The images have nothing to do with the music and give absolutely no learning or development value. I personally like the Baby Miracle series of videos that give a great baby sized bible message while being very interactive with my baby.
This cover is the best you can get for your Sansa E series player. It increases the size a little but the durability is worth it. The belt clip is great cause I use mine at the gym too. I purchased an armband but this is much better.  It also comes with a display cover that I have discovered is a necessary item, my display began to show minor scratches after only a couple of weeks use, so if you don't buy this, at least get the little expensive stick on covers. The toughskin also makes the function buttons work a little easier. The small down side to this cover is not being able to get to the micro-sd slot without removing the Sansa, but that is only a small issue. My advice, you have spent big bucks for a great little mp3 player so spend a little more and protect it the best you can
Great idea to hang clothes. The hangers are not long enough to keep the clothes on.  If your child is like mine who loves to dress and re-dress dolls, the armoire is not big enough if you purchase more then 3 outfits. The price is great now. I paid $20.  Great item just wish it was a little bigger maybe even a drawer. 
I brought this because  my kids love spongebob & ice cream..perfect toy, right? WRONG!  The ice cream oozes out of all of spongebob's cracks leaving most of it on your table and very little in the cone.  We have to use half a container of ice cream just to make 2 small cones and then I have a huge mess left in the kitchen. 
I have a 33-34 waste. I bought the medium size because it is  advertised to be fit for 32-34 waste. The thing is too tight! It almost blocks circulation to my legs. Plus, the fabric is not entirely pleasant to the touch. I was mostly disappointed with this product. You can find a much better value at this price
stupid that for bad supply side business i havent gotten the magazine and wont get it for at least another month and yet i am asked to write a review for it. BOO AMAZON WHERES MY MAGAZINE
How can he be such an enormous talent when all he does is copy off of other people? sorry i just cant see it. I dont think he does justice to Nolan Porter's "If I could only be sure" on the first track at all: If you want to hear some great music listen to the original!!!
Just wanted resonably attractive storage. These do the trick. Ordered six and none were defective
I had a hard time finding a play pen for my Grand daughter. There are many Pack N Play items but I wanted a larger square playpen like they made years ago. This one was exactly what I wanted. She has room to roll around and play with toys and it's easy to set up and take down
My 4 year old son received this as a Christmas present.  He has really enjoyed playing it so far.  He can do most of the activities without help.  There is one part where you have to ride a cart down a mountain and click buttons to duck or jump, which I think is pretty hard for little ones (it actually took me a couple of tries to make it down the mountain).  There are many different learning activities:  matching, memory, shapes, size, etc. We did not have any problems loading the game on our computer as another reviewer did.  We have a new Dell computer running on windows XP
I purchased this outdoor atomic clock three months ago and hung it out by our backyard pool.  It is sheltered a bit by the roof overhang, but it still gets some blowing wind and rain.  So far, the clock has kept perfect atomic time.  The temperature indicator is a bit small, so we really can't see that feature from the pool deck, but the hands on the clock are easy to read.  This clock serves our purpose perfectly.  I have read reviews that say outdoor clocks like this aren't really suited for the weather, but I have no complaints, and it's been 90 days of crazy Florida weather.  We got the clock with free shipping, so the price was right, too.  Great clock, great deal
If it is possible to fall madly in love with a box of chocolates, then the assortment is the perfect place to start such an adventure. These chocolate are named after Leonidas Kestekidis, who definitely knew how to create chocolates for the true chocolate connoisseur.  ---  --- When he moved back to Belgium he not only married his true love, he created chocolates the world now adores. When you taste these chocolates, your taste buds will also finally know true chocolate happiness. Whether you try one of these with a cup of coffee or tea or enjoy one as a daily indulgence, these will impress.  ---  --- The "I Love You" chocolate with dreamy lemon filling embodies this sentiment. Each chocolate has a unique design and the I Love You chocolate has two hearts, ribbons and a seal. After you sample the variety of chocolates, specific flavors will stand out as favorites.  ---  --- Here are my favorite creamy fillings (ganache and butter cream) which come in dark, white and milk chocolate depending on the selection:  ---  --- Antoinette - A smooth Brandy flavored ganache  ---  --- Lingoit Lait - Absolutely delicious vanilla flavored fresh butter cream filling. Time definitely stopped while tasting this chocolate.  ---  --- Irrésistible - Dark chocolate and Strawberry sauce.  ---  --- For ever - If you love coffee this may be one of the most delicious milk or dark chocolate chocolates ever made as it is filled with a special coffee cream that has hints of caramel. I ordered an entire box of these and they come in a variety of flavors. The milk chocolate and cherry filling is like Claude Debussy's Rêverie. It is difficult to describe besides saying it is like a delicate cherry icing wrapped in milk chocolate.  ---  --- Merveilleux - Milk or dark chocolate filled with coffee ganache.  ---  --- Europe - Dark or milk chocolate filled with rum filling.  ---  --- Ganache - Milk or dark chocolate with pure ganache.  ---  --- Tosca - Milk chocolate with a special ganache.  ---  --- Poésie - Dark chocolate and a Cointreau filling.  ---  --- Antoinette - Delicate caramel hints in the milk chocolate coating mingle nicely with the vanilla filling.  ---  --- Eve - Milk or dark chocolate with a creamy dreamy banana filling.  ---  --- Alexandre le grand - A milk or dark chocolate with caramel cream.  ---  --- Also Recommended:  ---  --- If you wish to also try the Napolitains, I'd suggest the 1 pound sampler Ballotin with six varieties. You may also want to look for the new Palet d'Or. A deeply delicious and strong bitter chocolate filled with ganache. The center is made with butter, cream and chocolate and the outer coating is a masterpiece with gold decorations.  ---  --- Leonidas now has over 1700 stores and sales locations worldwide and they offer over 80 varieties of fresh chocolates. The chocolates are air freighted weekly from Brussels so you will always find the quality to be superior.  ---  --- My chocolates arrived fast and were as fresh as if I had purchased them in Belgium. They were carefully packaged in the famous gold boxes with signature/seasonal wrapping and a ribbon. The boxes were then placed in protective Styrofoam containers to protect the chocolates during shipping. The expedited shipping is recommended from May to early September.  ---  --- ~TheRebeccaReview.com
If you work in a comic book store, live in your mom's basement, own a lot of black candles, and think that H. P. Lovecraft wrote history books, then you might like this garbage. If you have a life, a clue, or a girlfriend, then you probably will not have any use for this stuff. I still can't figure out how record companies get away with classifying this pseudointellectual fluff as metal. It belongs in a category with Sisters of Mercy or Morrisey. This record is completely lacking any imagination or energy: depressing teenagers is like shooting fish in a barrel. I guess if you want to play dungeons and dragons and fester about feeling like an outcast, this would be the thing to listen to. Personally I think it's a huge ripoff when somebody takes five minutes worth of music and stretches it out into an hour. Don't give these jokers your money.
They spend the first half of this movie saying how great the Ultimate Warrior was.  The journey is awesome!  Then all of the sudden, the paid WWE guys just began to bad-mouth the Warrior. Maybe he did have questionable judgment - but why are they trying to make us feel bad about someone we loved?  They take some very low blows. They say that the Warrior was a bad wrestler. Actually he seemed just fine to me when I was young, and I really can't distinguish one's ability from the other. They just all gang up on him and make outragious allegations. Vince says quickly that the reason why the Ultimate disappeared for 3 years was because he failed a drug test. As soon as he says this, they fade to black then come back with a new issue. What drug use? Which drugs? Presumably they're talking about steroids. But what about that high and mighty Hulk Hogan with his admitted drug use. Let's not talk about that - let's just keep ganging up on the Warrior. They completely ridicule him changing his name to the Warrior. And they also just try to badmouth him so much. Who cares that none of the wrestlers liked him? I don't! He excited the heck out of me way more than any of the dorks who say bad things about him -including Hulk. And oh yeah - they don't even let the Warrior defend himself.  Why did I have to find out from IMDB.com that he was asked to appear but declined? Why don't they address this?  This "docu" is more slanted than "Fahrenheitt 911" Every wrestling and Ultimate Warrior fan will start out loving this docu then hating it. It just leaves you with a bitter taste in your mouth, tired of all of the whining and bitter trash talking.
I think a lot of people miss the power of this movie.  To me this is a scathing view of how simple minded religious people are duped by Ministries in this country.  Even though this was made some years ago before the advent of the infamous TV Ministries today, the message is still clear.  Those who have only a simplistic relgious outlook are prey for the kind of charletans portrayed in this movie.   ---  --- This is certainly one of Burt Lancaster's better roles, and he plays it with much guesto! If we were to look at most of the popular Ministers today we would find that many are from this dark kind of background.  This movie has a strong message.  Don't listen to the word of God from others.  If you must believe in the wild stories of the Bible, do so in your own way.  Do not sanction phoney churches and preachers with your time and money! Even in this modern day and age, the influence of this kind of hokem is still strong.  Mr. Bush and the Republican Party used it as a means to seek re-election!   ---  --- Everyone who is a born again Christian, or a church goer of any kind should see this movie and perhaps get a better understanding of what the religious industry is in this country.  The ending of the film is perhaps a bit contrived, meant to imply the dangers of man assuming the powers of the Almighty (if there is one).  Still, a powerful film for its time and contains a worthwhile message for viewers today. 
This wagon was easy to put together.  We use it frequently when picnicking outdoors and going to the park.  It is big enough for my 2 year old to lie down and take a nap.  It was also large enough to hold our lunch cooler and my daughter.  It is very easy to pull around and is very durable
The graphics are clear, but they are bad! Horses look nothing like that and it is really gross! I would say get it for the younger kids, because they won't care. ---  --- There is nothing to do with the game except earn money, build your hotel, and keep your horse from getting sick. You don't get to ride that often because it said "you have ridden enough for this round" and it is very enoying. you can't pay enough monay to keep more than one horse, but you need to jump them to earn money so you can build your hotel / parking lot / jumping corse / breeding paddock / ect. But you can't do that unless you can jump the horse alot, and you can't. It is easy to go 'bankrupt' so I would say this game is not for little kids because of the money dealing. ---  --- not for older kids because of the dumbness of the horses look, not for younger kids because of the money problems. --- So don't get this game
There were so many continuity errors and spelling problems in this book that I had to stop. Trying to follow two-dimensional characters are difficult enough.  I was just looking for a good fiction book that contained gay themes, characters or both.  I got the gay but not the story
I love this bracelet but the clasp is seriously defective.  I contacted Sabrina, and they were great about sending me a new one ASAP, with a label for returning the other one.  That was impressive, and such responsive customer service is not to be undervalued.  Still, the clasp is a product defect, and I'm sure one of these days I will probably loose the bracelet b/c it comes undone unknowingly
I knew I should have waited!  I got impatient and bought the Masterworks DVD and after watching it once could not bear to see it again, the colors were that awful.  Of course I have to get this, but it's still galling. ---  --- Now if they would only release El Amour Brujo
This toilet seat made it very discouraging for my son to start potty training since the splash gaurd left him with a rash on his inner thighs and lower tummy. The splash guard does not have a smooth finish and when it rubs against his skin, it can be quite painful. I plan on trying the baby bjorn seat, it looks like it would be more comfortabl
I have a 650 with a cell number that has been with me for over 10 years. Perhaps blinded by this incredibly good price, I thought my fulfilled contract (I am on month to month now) meant I could qualify for a "new account" and keep my number. No such luck. After wasting a few hours dealing with Cingular and then someone in India on behalf of Wirefly, I had to return it. It is ironic that someone who has never had a cell phone can get a price 75% lower than a loyal 13 year customer! I will take the next carrier that offers a reasonable price on a 700 even though I would prefer the 750
I got this as a freebie along with W and it lasted only as long as I received it for one year.  The use of fur and skins was nauseating and I couldn't have been more disgusted at the vapid, innocuous, 'insights' it offered.  This magazine has no redeeming social value. 
I have not yet looked at all the documents included in this software. I appreciate the tutorial nature and the pro/con examples given. Since I am not a lawyer, I am a bit nervous about making legal decisions that would need a test in court to be sure I made the correct choices. I did complete the HealthCare Directive and it compares well with others I've seen used in my state. I need to learn more about estate planning and this is going to teach me the jargon and the proper questions to ask. ---  --- My only complaint is that I declined the free delivery option and paid for delivery so I would have enough time to work with it before my parents appointment with their estate attorney.  It did not arrive in a timely manner and I was forced to purchase a download version from another vendor in order to complete forms I wanted the attorney to look at.  It is no surprize that he was more interested in drawing up his own forms for my parents and charging $1000 for a basic package. ---  --- I decided to keep the CD anyway (when it finally arrived) just in case I have a hard drive failure. 
This program is fantastic. It's super easy to use and has a calendar that will notify you of upcoming events/holidays/etc. There are loads of pre-made cards to choose from or you can edit them to your needs. You can also make your own card without any help. The same thing for envelopes!  ---  --- There are also quite a few additional projects included. You can create your own stationary sets (paper and envelopes), awards and certificates, kid's activity pages and more. ---  --- I highly recommend this program if you're a beginner card maker. I mostly bought this (I was a beginner) to save money on cards and in the 2 months I've had this program, it has more than paid for itself. It's much more convenient than going to the store, WAY cheaper and I really like being able to make matching envelopes.
I was very pleased that this seller emailed me right away when I sent him an email about my concerns that the product might not be exactly what I needed and wanted to cancel the order. He very quickly emailed me and assured me he would cancel and refund my credit card and I was impressed with this service. Gayla Tregr
I can only say that this was my favorite record of last year. This record is hard to find in your local record store, so search it out... Incredible - can't wait to hear more!
For the Price, I doubt you could do better.  True, there are higer-end devices out there that will improve your picture to the pinnacle of performance, but if all you're after is a significant improvement in the quality of EVERY channel and DVD you watch, you can't beat the ADS for it's price. The biggest flaw is the device's inability to deal with program material that has excessive light or white backgrounds, where the device either creates artifacts or attempts to correct resolution causing my Philips Plasma set to black-out for moments.  This aside, I'm very happy with the ADS, especially it's under $300 price.  One day maybe I'll upgrade to a unit by DVDO, but not until they come don to the sub-$500 range
I am exceptionally pleased with the product and the company.  I had a minor problem with the merchandise and let them know.  I had an immediate response and the problem was rectified faster than I ever expected
Bought this for my boy who just turned 11. Let's just say that he totally loved it and it was the first present he played with. Two blinking lights on weapon. One light on helmet which makes the eyes glow. A little pricier than other Bionicles but worth it. Not too hard to put together, just make sure you put all of the tiny pieces in a bowl or some such thing so you don't lose them while assembling the guy. The folks at LEGO are geniuses, sure it's a franchise, but they're doing a great job keeping it interesting
I saw the movie in a theater when it first came out. I was a teenager and, although I believed it to be primarily a girl's movie, I did enjoy it. I've seen it several times since then, and it still has not lost its charm. When I finally did read the book, I was disappointed that the movie didn't follow it more closely. To me, these are two different stories. The Holly in the movie is likeable; the novella's Holly is a harpie who cares for no one or nothing else. (When my wife saw the movie, she remarked that Holly was, "an idiot.") However, the book's storyline is more interesting...more haunting, and the book's ending is more intriguing. The movie ends as a love story. The book is much more. And, oh yes, whatever you may think of Capote as an individual, the guy was a damn good writer
Used once. Unit Blew a fuse. No manufacturer supplied info on fuse and none on the fuse body. No contact information was provided by manufacturer or seller. Had to calculate fuse rating. --- Unit is very slow to make coffee. --- Power plug does not fit well in 12V accessory recepticles. Does not go deep enough into recepticle to hold itself in place, has a tendency to pop out of the recepticle. --- No return information provded. --- Considering all the problems, I would not buy another product from this manufacturer, nor would I recommend it to anyone else. Unit is overpriced
This is a good battery and lasts for a long time. Good value
This game is truly worth the wait.  It really makes you feel like you are creating a drug empire and it is incredibly addicting.  The gameplay is awesome the shooting mechanics work great much better than any of the GTA games. This is one of the funnest games to shoot people in and the chainsaw is really awesome.  This probally the funnest open world game i have ever played to drive in.  The cars handle great and are a blast to drive.  The graphics look great and the particle effects are truly awesome.  This is a must get game
I bought this rechargeable shaving system for my husband for Christmas.  It was a replacement of a corded shaver he had been using.  He has been enjoying the features offered by this device.  He especially likes the ability to rinse it out after each use.  It gives a close shave and has a quick charge feature that allows you to charge it for a few minutes and gives at least two shaves.  He has used the razor for about two weeks now with no complaints.  It was a great price for a quality product
Gunpowder tea is green tea, most of which comes from a city named Pingshui in the Eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang, south of the Yangtse River Delta, where it has been cultivated for centuries and is known as the "green pearl" of tea. Pingshui tea market records date as far back as the Tang Dynasty (AD 618 - 907). The area's gunpowder tea was an important tribute traditionally given to the Chinese emperors; and with the growing trade volume between China and the West it also acquired an increasing number of lovers in Europe. Particularly during the second half of the 19th century, when gunpowder tea export reached its peak, its price on the London market was second only to then-popular Wu Yi Oolong (also from China). Even today, Zhejiang Province still proudly calls itself "home of silk and tea" for its two primary natural products.  ---  --- The name "gunpowder" derives from the tea's elaborate method of processing, which traditionally lasts several hours and during which the tea leaves are withered, steamed or stir-fried and individually rolled into small pellets. Early foreign traders mistook these pellets for gunpowder or gunshot.  ---  --- Gunpowder tea has a delicate aroma with a slightly smokey note. It should *always* be enjoyed without milk or cream
I have to say that even though Teti Hatcher's performance was good the movie itself was terrible. The plot was pretty dumb and the situations that take place in the movie are not believable. I can;t believe I wasted my money on this one
ALways loved this group....own several of their CD's and this is by far my favorite.  Darryl Hall's phrasing of his songs are superb.
This shelter met all my expectations.  I would tell anyone to get the optional sand bags if you do not plan to use spikes to secure it.  Being so large, it catches quite a bit of wind and would surely tip over otherwise.  I had mine setup on a raised deck, so the sandbags were a life saver!  Overall this is a high quality item and has already been used a few times and is a much more economical option to renting party tents!  The storage bag is outstanding too... with nice wheels and a handle - it is easy to transport!  The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because it is a little challenging to setup because it is so large
I watched this movie and it sucked,very slow.It might be a renter not a owner
I bought this to fill with sands and candles for an indoor area. It creates a cozy and warm addition when we watch movies and sports. The cover is a nice protective from the kids touching the candles. The sand protectes the fire pit from getting to warm. ---  ---  ---  ---  --- 
Had this game on our gamecube, so addicting then, now we have it on our DS and it is just as much fun. Only downside to it is it can be confusing as to how to unlock all the stuff.  You have to get a certain rating I believe, like A-D, nonetheless it is a great game, worth the money! If you have kids, the kids will thoroughly enjoy
Stiff Upper Lip is a good AC/DC album, it's not a great AC/DC album. ---  --- It kills me when people say that AC/DC have sounded the same since 1973 on every album they have done.  Nothing could be further from the truth. ---  --- I have always thought that each AC/DC album has a sound and a feel and a story in it's own and that a track off each album would be totally out of place on another album.  For instance, can you image Shake a Leg on Stiff Upper Lip?  Or Ballbreaker on Back in Black? ---  --- It doesn't work.  Stiff Upper Lip has its own kind of rough, bluesy feel to it.  Brian's voice sounds different, the tones and the guitars sound different.  It's good but not great.  The standouts... ---  --- 1. Stiff Upper Lip- Pretty rocking song.  Has a good attitude.  It's fun. ---  --- 2. Hold Me Back and Can't Stand Still.  Very odd rolling songs.  They sound a lot alike.  Again, these songs could NEVER have been on Back in Black.  I have heard that Brian sang Can't Stand Still in one take, that's why they all clap at the end.  I don't know if that's true, but it's an interesting song. ---  --- 3. Satellite Blues- This one is an instant classic.  I LOVE this song.  This song could have been done back in the days of Back in Black and if it were on that album I think it would be as popular as You Shook Me All Night Long. ---  --- Everything else is ho hum.  Not good, not bad.  Better than most bands out there.  I am really hoping AC/DC put out a killer album with their new release, whenever that is.  I hope they don't turn into the new G&R and suffer from the Chinese Democracy syndrome
The item was packaged well, but it took over 15 days at normal shipping rate.  The lighter for it stopped working 15 minutes after it was opened. Anyone want the rest of this can? What a waste of time
Like most people who made the effort to see this movie, I read Tim Sandlin's book and thoroughly enjoyed it.  --- Unfortunately for this movie, Sandlin is a far better novelist than screenwriter.  --- The film is disjointed, awkward, and hard to follow. It quickly hops from one important moment of the book to another, allowing almost no time to understand the characters and their motivations or appreciate the bizarre circumstances of the story.  --- The casting isn't bad-- a prepubescent Mischa Barton was a fine choice (a hysterical one for fans of the O.C.), and Jennifer Jason Leigh is also respectable, although she doesn't fit her character's physical description-- but that doesn't nearly make up for the film's jumpy direction and half-baked plot.  --- In sum, this is a dissatisfying and substandard film. Undoubtedly, the subject matter is better suited for a novel, and Sandlin's humor and talents are better utilized there.  --- Read his books. Avoid this movie.
There are lots of little pieces, and the rules are a bit complex. I played it with my nephews ages 7 and 5 and they both had a hard time staying interested for the length of the game. However they have both asked to play it since, so they must like something about it :
I deinstall the product after two weeks of use.  It did not allow me to select Adobe Reader as my default program and was not able to open many PDF documents.  If a document was opened it was often incorrectly formatted for viewing.  Also, the feature to allow editing of the documents in Word or Excel was most often non-functional
Tom Cruise gives an excellent performance as IMF agent Ethan Hunt,who is framed for murder after the death of his IMF team.Together with the help of two other IMF agents,Hunt sets out to find the real murderer.Cornered most of the movie and set to his limits,Hunt and team are hard put to catch the assailants.It all leads to a final showdown on a speeding bullet train with an unlikely foe.Hard core action and awesome intellegence meet in this exhillirating action drama by filmmaker Brian DePalma
Having an M.A. in English literature as well as a B.A. in literature and history, anytime a movie is BOTH historical AND literary . . . well, I get a bit excited to say the least. I don't wish to give the impression that this movie is based on absolute and authentic history because it's not, but the writers/directors/producers set it against a "historical" backdrop nonetheless. On that note, this is yet another stellar title from noneother than Ridley Scott. With that being said, I enjoyed "Tristan and Isolde" almost as much as "Gladiator" and a bit more than "Kingdom of Heaven" (all of these, by the way, are Ridley Scott films). Notice the historical adaptations here?  ---  --- While it may be true that the story of Tristan and Isolde was inspirational to Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet" as well as possibly fueling much of the intrigue of the Arthurian legend, this movie is not exclusively for the high-browed college types. No sir, good ol' red-blooded men and women will certainly be drawn into both the action as well as the romance in this movie. This is by no means a "chick flick" since there is present a large degree of bloodshed and overall suspense. On the other hand, it's not the typical "hack and slash" macho film because at its core is a very dynamic love story. In short, it should please both sexes simultaneously.  ---  --- Aside from James Franco (Tristan), I was rather unfamiliar with most of the cast. Sophia Myles (Isolde) is, for the most part, a newcomer to American audiences despite a rather large resume in mostly British films. I suspect this film will provide her the recognition she certainly deserves on this side of the Atlantic. While many of the other characters were convincing in their roles, no other character was more believable in his villainy than that of the arrogant Irish king (who just so happens to be Isolde's father).  ---  --- In short, this is one of the best movies I've seen in awhile. On some levels it reminds me of "King Arthur." Just as "King Arthur" attempted to provide a plausible history of the legendary Arthur, Guinevere, and Lancelot, so too does Ridley Scott by placing the action a few years after the establishment of the Angle and Saxon kingdoms in England. If you'll recall in "King Arthur," Arthur helps hold back the onslaught of the invading Saxons just as the Roman legions were exiting Britannia. Historians will point out that there is no evidence of Saxons in England until several decades AFTER the Roman withdrawal, but oh well . . . it made for a good story. Here, we witness the Celtic Britons as they are exploited by the Irish across sea. WHAT???? The Irish doing the exploiting and not the other way around? Well, "Tristan and Isolde" holds true to history in this aspect; namely, that the Celtic Britons of England were indeed pushed to the easternmost shores of the island after the coming of the Anglo-Saxons. This would, of course, have placed them in what is now Wales and Cornwall. And this is exactly where the movie is set. Let's not forget the story of Saint Patrick. Remember, he was actually a Romanized Briton who was captured and served as a slave in Ireland before escaping and ultimately returning to Ireland to convert the populace to Christianity. It's interesting to note that in the movie Christianity is a fairly new-fangled religion in Ireland, so no doubt Ridley Scott intended this to remind us of the time period at hand.  ---  --- I particulary liked "King Arthur" and "Kingdom of Heaven" despite the lukewarm reception they received from the critics. Critically speaking, "Tristan and Isolde" has been a bit of a mixed bag as well---but who really bases their decision to watch a movie on the arrogant views of movie critics?  ---  --- Rent it first if you must, but I suspect this one will be a "keeper" in your DVD library! 
I have about an inch and a half of space between my lazy susan and the adjacent bank of drawers.  If I install this lock, the base of it will block one of the drawers from opening.  It also means that I would have to drill into the formica trim on the cabinet.  I'm returning it
I purchased quickbooks 2005; 4th upgrade in 10 years. --- Unlike earlier versions, this one is confusing and painful to use. ---  --- Simple things like making deposits has to do through contraptions. ---   --- One of the reasons I upraded was to use Online banking; it's a complete disaster. It doesn't download the complete trasaction details, reconcilliations are very difficult. --- You will be doing twice the work to use it. ---  --- Once my transfer to the bank was aborted by a message saying you are low on memory and though Quickbooks sent the transaction to the bank, it didn't mark it internally, so on the next login, it sent the payment again!!! It has cost me $1509 of double payment that I am still trying to get back! ---  --- How you pay a bill is totally messed up, There is no way for you to mark that a bill was paid online unless it was done through quickbooks online connection. (Bank's billpay can't be used!!) ---  --- It's very poor in organization, you can't have 2 accounts #'s with  a vendor (still in 2005!!!). --- It has introduced obscure concepts as items and classes, which have no real definition and no "default" use and stop every transaction. ---  --- One of the biggest thing Quickbooks has done to hurt their customers is the payroll. Technically you can do it yourself, but they hide that information and scare you in every step that you should (must) buy the $299/year payroll service (old tax-tables). --- In all the documenation, not once do they mention that you can do the payroll directly and this is how. --- Compared to the earlier products, this is a huge cost. By that reckoning I would have paid ~$2000 for the previous version of quickbooks!! ---  --- It's definitely cheaper to buy a basic version of the software and use an accountant to do the other work and you will be better  --- off. Don't waste money on Quicken services or premium products, they will bleed you to death on your way to a mental asylum
I was tired of the rental skates and wanted to be able to zip around the floor with my kids at the skating rink.  So I bought these skates.  At the time, it felt a little impulsive to spend so much on skates.  Well, now I know I should have spent more and at least be happy with what I purchased. ---  --- I had such a hard time skating with these skates, and when I talked to the guy at the pro shop and 2 people online (there are a lot of resources online-do a search for quad skates) I realized these skates were made for beginning kids, never a 36 year old mom!  They are not made to do the kind of things on the floor you think you might be able to do.  In fact, I couldn't even turn.  I kept having to push off because they would slow down.  I kept adjusting them and had a professional at the rink adjust them for me, and forget it!  I'm selling them at the resale shop and spending more money to at least get something decent
OK, I am not overly modest and 95% of the shorts/pants I buy fit when I purchase and XL size.  These shorts are made for anorexic bean poles.  If you have thighs, legs or even a *tiny* bit of junk in the trunk, forget it.  These are designed for 16 year old girls, not men.  Shipping is also super slow
 --- Turbotax was a great service, but I would like to be able to navigate with menus/tabs to a greater degree of specificity within the input pages itself. Writing the return often requires back-tracking to a page that you alread covered. --- To get to a particular prior page, I would often be forced to go through up to 5 or 6 prior pages, reading the question each time because turbotax highlighted the default which was not my previous choice. This was a colossal waste of time in an otherwise excellent product. It could easily be fixed in the 2006 software if turbotax 1) switched the defaults to the users' previously-inputted values (CompleteTax does this and it seems like an obvious thing to do) and/or made it easy to navigate to a prior page by giving a link to every input page when a user clicks a superior tab or link. This is what a good web-page does, and it would be very helpful if turbotax did the same.  
Here's the deal, I was looking for a good way to move the oil filter to a different place under the hood and this kit did the job perfectly.  The filter on my son's car is on the side of the engine block (Nissan 240SX) and located right above a section of the frame that has holes in the top.  Every time I remove the filter, the oil drains out of the filter and enevitably into the frame (a big wad of shop rags or towels under the filter helps, but not always), then I've got oil draining from the frame for the next week, making a mess all over the driveway.  Anyway, the pump thing with the drain tube running from the pan is unique, but not what I bought the kit for (I only used the filter relocator).  Was impressed with the quality of the fittings and the hoses and everything hooked up like they said it would.  The big plus though.....  it's about one third the cost of any other kit out there (including those listed on Amazon.com)and it comes with adapters to fit just about any car.  Been on the car now for about 8 months with no problems and has made changing the filter sooooo much easier and cleaner....... in fact decided to buy another kit from Amazon for my own car
When merging female vocal yodels and copying elements from Switchblade Syphony, one can only be disappointed in Diva Destruction's music.  The positive aspect is the better production on this CD compared to their debut
Bought an assortment of the Drake's snacks because of them being often mentioned on "King of Queens" and was surprised at how tasty these apple pies were. Just the right balance of fruit and cinnamon. Great late night snack. Buy em
This watch is exactly what I was looking for. It is a small, pretty, functional watch that is quite durable.  It has plenty of features, but is not extremely complicated. The color is slightly lighter and more purpley then it is in the pictures
I purchased the Casio keyboard for my Grand-daughter's 4th birthday.  She really enjoyed playing it.  As a matter of fact she was still interested in it the next day.  It is the perfect size for a small child.  She sits in her recliner and has the keyboard across the arms.  The only thing that wasn't perfect is that you can mute what the child is playing, but not the 10 songs that are prerecorded in it
It is a good watch under $200 price range. If you buy it, you will love it forever. One thing I hate is little bit heavy, but not a big deal. :) 
speakers give good sound quality and are small and unnoticeable at a good price all the things I was looking for in speake
This holster provides good protection for the device and has the sturdy swivel clip for your belt.  The flap is secured by a magnet making it easy to remove the device.  It does just what you want it to do
Phillip Hoffman is searching for purity.  Unfortunately his play has been purchased by a wild Hollywood movie crew, and they are off and shooting in Waterford, Vermont because Main Street is already there.  It is cheaper than building a set.  Then the town folks, New Englanders, dry and pragmatic, mingle with Hollywood slime balls, daft, smooth-talking director, William H. Macy and screen idol, young girl chasing, Alex Baldwin. Sarah J. Parker of Sex in the City fame plays the nymphomaniac actress bedding everyone in sight.  Small town smart girl Rebecca Pigeon and writer Hoffman make the necessary changes in the script and then they fall in love. A scandal threatens the shoot and somebody forgets the mayor's dinner party.  There is plenty of manic fun here.  I recommend for a good laugh. Also, is it just me or is William H. Macy the best actor in the world
I'm on a low carb diet and didn't like just eating a bowl of plain tuna with mayo... yuck!  I add a cup of Dreamfield's elbows to give me a better lunch for only 5 net carbs and now I actually look forward to having tuna.  Also, for 7 carbs you can add shredded cheese, a drop of milk, a pat of butter and pinch of salt to indulge yourself in a creamy macaroni with cheese dish!  Yummy :o
Outstanding service - product was as described and the price was fair - mailing in a timely manner was acceptable.  Will continue to shop for similar items via Amazon
I own the first two volumes of the Lost Treasures series and am waiting for the third to arrive on my doormat. They are brilliant and I hope more volumes appear on a regular basis. --- Why though, must I suffer for purchasing these titles when they are released by not being able to get The Plays volume without buying them all over again? --- I suspect (and hope) that it will eventually be released seperately but in the meantime I can only say that if you don't already own any of these and are a fan of Broadway, theatre or the performing arts in general, buy this today! A fantastic showcase of theatrical talent
These bibs are the best. My son is a messy eater and loves to drink water and spit it out. When meal time is over his shirt is dry and all the water is in the handy pouch. Must have for any new parent
This is my first purchase that I have been unhappy with.  The tingler arrived with two of the tingles off.  Attempts to put them back on were unsuccessful.  I had attempted to email customer service three separate times and have received no response.  I would appreciate either a refund or a new one sent to my address. ---  --- Jon Fresh --- 2716 NE Lorie Dr. --- Hillsboro, Or 97124. ---  --- The tingler was to be part of a massage Christmas gift for my wife.  I would appreciate your time in this matter. ---  --- Thanks, ---  --- Jon Fres
My house was built in 1862 and I have struggled with several different gates trying to get one to fit my odd sized, crooked doorways. This gate (when hardware mounted) adjusts to fit my doorways where no other gate could. I agree that it's not easy to use, you have to readjust the size each time it's opened or closed, but for me it's worth it to have a gate that fits my crooked doorways. Also, the hardware mounted installation template that was included made it SUPER easy to install. I'm very happy with this gate
This book written by Don Brown is a wonderful children's book.  In this story, set in 1870, Mary Kingsley uses her childhood to motivate her travels to Africa. Mary begins the story as a child, who is taking care of her ill mother. Her father travels a lot, and is rarely home. Although Mary never attended school she loves to read and uses this to escape. Mary, now an adult travels to Africa which was a big accomplishment for a woman at that time. The book tells some of her experiences in Africa. Without revealing what happens at the end, I will tell you that Mary has many experiences in this children's book. She takes the reader through her life. The illustrations in the book help the reader visualize Mary's life. This is not my favorite children's book, but I would highly recommend this book to any parent or child. It kept my interest and it is sure to keep yours
I've been doing game dev for a number of years now, and it's like a breath of fresh air to come upon a book like this. Clearly written, well organized, and a breeze to read through! My thanks goes out to each and every one of the authors who contributed to this invaluable tome.  I'd give this thing six stars if I could. You will not regret buying this book!!
It worked quite nicely until after about 9 months the display just stopped working.  Changed the batteries to no avail.  It's very pretty, but I have a less attractive old Tanita that does body fat measurements which has been working for 5 years
Unless you are interested in reading one chapter after another plugging Bear Spray, don't waste your time.  The stories are all re-hashed versions of nearly identical situations; Man goes into the wilderness-Man sees bear-Man uses UDAP Bear Spray on bear-bear retreats.  This book is one long advertisement for UDAP!!  My book was actually misprinted, missing 50 pages right in the middle.  Initially I wanted to return my book for a complete one but, after reading the rest of 223 pages, I didn't want to waste any more of my time with this ONE story
The thing that seperates this DVD Case from the rest is it's center lock design. It's secures the disc nicely without damaging it... like I have had others do. Worth the extra dough to have a quality product. (Now if only their memorex's software was as good!
I was a little hesitent to make a big order for so much tea, not knowing if I would like it.  So I went to a local supermarket and bought a tin there so I might give it a taste test.  This is quite a good green tea.  Other than buying generic green teabags, I usually buy a Bancha tea. This tea is not as grassy, more bold with a slight smokey taste and more of a kickiness to it. --- The cannisters are nice and their is an inside foil liner to keep the tea fresh.  The only thing to be aware is that this is a lot of tea, altogether 21 ounces divided into six separate cannisters. Unless you really love this tea, plan on making some gifts
Okay, I may be picky, but these earrings are just too thin!  I get the idea of delicate, sparkly things, but these don't look so much delicate as they do insubstantial.  They are pretty and sparkly, but the crystal looks like all I could afford was a thin slice.  The picture also makes the crystals appear blue-ish, but mine are more of a yellow-ish tint.  Not what I expected
I finally subscribed to Glamour after buying it every month at the grocery store, each time saying it would be the last time I bought this "vapid silly thing." What can I say? It's addictive. We can't read the Economist all the time now, can we
Makes plane flights so much more enjoyable and costs hundreds less than other brands.  Only  thing that could make it better is passive noise reduction but then it would be bulkier
Unfortunately, I have not received the item.  It's been 4.5 weeks since I placed the order.  I am reviewing this a low star, it should not take this long to receive a magazine subscription
The title of this movie holds no secrets. The Virgin suicides may have its up and downs throughout the movie but the whole time the viewer is left with an impending sense of doom. Almost every aspect of this movie is fantastic, between the acting and a great story line, but this movie is truly dramatic in that it will no doubt influence your emotions
I shopped online for probably two months before finally settling on these headphones.  I wanted nice headphones to compliment my iPod, yet at an affordable price.  The AKG K 27i is the perfect solution.  After looking at other models by AKG, and other brands like Sennheiser and Bose, I thought I would have to spend at least $100 in order to get quality, but then I found these and I snatched them up. ---  --- The sound is excellent.  When I first plugged them in, I thought they were a little quiet.  But, then I discovered that there is a lanyard-style volume switch on the headphones themselves, which is fantastic.  I don't have to reach into my pocket to turn the volume up or down on my iPod.  The sound is very crisp and articulate, with deep, accentuating bass.  And because these headphones are designed for portable mp3 players, my iPod is powerful enough to really push the drivers of the headphones. ---  --- The soft ear pads offer great comfort for long listening (and sound dampening! They block out a lot of ambient noise!), but the headband takes some getting used to, as it is a little bit tight.  Once you adjust to it though, you can wear them for hours. ---  --- The last thing I will mention is the style.  These headphones look great and the colors compliment the white iPod really well.  They also fold up to an incredibly compact size, and they even come with a travel pouch.  Now that is convenient. ---  --- If you are looking for great headphones for your portable mp3 player, I truly say look no further.  I did so much research before settling on these, that I feel like I became an expert in the audio field.  The AKG K 27i offers amazing sound, great comfort, compact size, and best of all, affordability
I started with Norton Ghost 2003 many years ago and had problems backing up clone images.  Acronis True Image Backup 9.0 has a simple user interface that works well.  I used it to re-image my son's computer without any problems.  It is a good product for the price.  I highly recommend making a backup image of your hard drive on a weekly basis
Take care because if not you can lose much air triying to know the preassure of the tire
A delicious, nutritious cereal that rebounds energy at breakfast or for a quick snack.  Very vegan and very good
This combo cable gateway and wireless router seems like a dream come true.  Instead, should you fail to heed my warning and purchase this item, you'll be subjected to a nightmare that will only end when you seek another wireless solution. ---  --- As a cable gateway the WCG200 performs as expected.  Setup with my ISP (Cox in southern California) was a breeze.  I was up and running in no time. ---  --- Wireless connectivity, however, has been an absolute nightmare.  None of my devices (laptops, bridge, print server) will stay connected for any length of time.  When the router is performing well, I'm lucky to stay connected for an hour.  When the router is performing poorly I can barely stay connected for 15 seconds. ---  --- The Linksys forums are crowded with other users reporting the same problem.  I've been unable to find any official acknowledgement or response from Linksys. ---  --- Do yourself a favor and avoid the WCG200.  You will regret purchasing it
Hot Hot Heat is one of the few new bands to pique my interest. Their first release was decent, but "Elevator" is even better. Great tunes, drums and guitars - and, of course, Steve Bays' yelping vocals. There's only three songs I really don't care for - "Pickin' It Up", "Soldier In A Box" and "Shame On You". Looking forward to the next CD
Almost immediately after I received this never-used pen, I noticed that the ink does not dispense evenly.  Often, it does not write on any surface.  After I scratch the pen tip wildly for ~5 seconds, it starts to write again.  I've thrown it away because it is too inconvenient for use.  However, it is very cheap, so maybe it's okay for someone who doesn't need to use a tiny pen too often
I TRASHED THE ISSUE WHEN I SAW THE SHOT OF TRASHY PARIS HILTON.  THERE IS ENOUGH NUDITY ALREADY IN YOUR PUBLICATION AND SEEING THAT SAD PIECE OF WORK (HER) ON THE COVER JUST TURNED ME OFF COMPLETELY.  SORRY YOU THOUGHT HER 'COVER WORTHY'.  PROBABLY MISSED SOME FINE ARTICLES.  SINCERELY: DEANE EVERETT 
This book gives a thorough analysis on how public policies were the catalysts for the socioeconomic destruction of low-income communities of color in New York City. Necessary reading for those who still do not  realize that activism and organizing are important vehicles through which  marginalized communities keep in check the forces that seek to further  fragment and disenfranchise them
This is my third Skagen watch.  The design is ultra thin and the titanium consturction makes it ultra light. The design is sophisticated enough for dress and sleek enough for sports wear. They have proven to be reliable timekeepers and I liked this one so much I bought two more for my sons. At less than $80.00 each they are a real bargin
I love this pasta so much that I'm constantly paranoid that it's not really low carb.  There is absolutely no taste difference, and it preps exactly the same as regular pasta
Good product Amazon had a great price.  Even though people say it is high priced I paid $44 after discounts.  I tried the Beta version and I liked it.  Beta version does not give you all of the features but enough to get the idea.  Easy to install worked at the get go.  Intuitive enough to figure it out.  You may have to go through things a few times to understand what it means.   Didn't have a manual with the Beta version and still figured it out. Manual does provide information, works great.  Didn't need any help. Had Mcafee before didn't find any new virus. It works as good as Mcafee but it is a lot faster when you start up.  Both Kaspersky and Mcafee have features I like. 
I was shocked by the level of neediness and desire to blame others expressed by Christiane Northrup in this jumble of a book. At a time when I needed medical advice to decipher the overwhelming physical changes happening to my body; I turned to Christian Northrup as a wise healer who has had the privilege of medical training and a mature woman with the actual experience of menopause. A wonderful combination if Northrup had chosen to focus on menopause. Instead she is all over the map, taking swipes at everyone who has disappointed her in her life. If I wanted to hear my gal pals whine about the mothers, husbands, and daughters I could have shared a meal with any group of women struggling through the ups and downs of life. Instead, I sought the help of a respected physician and got quite a shock, as she rehashes all the real and imagined slights of her life. If you are a middle aged woman who has "stuffed your feelings" all your life, and need help speaking up for your youself; this book may be a big help to you in finding your voice. But if you are a woman who has stood up for herself while you matured, this book will shock you with its pettiness. I am quite New Age and believe in all the woo-woo stuff mentioned in this book; but when I turn to a physician for medical advice on a medical issue; that's what I expect. I can only hope that Northrup will re-read this book as some point in her life and decide to take it out of publication. I was embarrassed for her and returned it. I just don't buy it in more ways then one.
We had to buy a new pack n play because our other one was coming apart. I chose this one because of its features and colors. My daughter hated this and screamed every time we put her in it. We tried for days to get her to use this, but she never would. So, we returned this and got a different that she absolutely loves.
I just began baking with Splenda when we found out my dad has pre-diabetes. For Easter I prepared a sugarless ricotta tart with Splenda and it worked beautifully. Everyone agreed that it didn't taste sugar-free and my dad really enjoyed it.
It took forever for this magazine to get to the address and it also is shipped a week to 2 weeks after the magazine is already on the stands.  What's the point of having a subscription if you get the magazine later than everyone else? I will never order a magazine from Amazon again, I'll go through the actual magazine company instead
These cookies do not taste like they ever saw the inside of a box. They taste like real butter and fresh ingredients - And they just about melt in your mouth. I'll be buying these again
I got this bra at a deeply discounted price when it was on clearance at a nearby store, and I didn't realize how much I liked it until I decided to buy another one some time later, and panicked when I couldn't make out the writing on the tag.  I have been trying to find this dang bra for AGES! Finally! I found it again! I am so stoked!  The one I bought so long ago is my favorite bra, and it looks pretty sad by now.  Like other reviewers' bras, mine developed a split in the fabric, but it was only after many, many washes in the machine, rides on the bike, exercise DVDs, naps, etc.   ---  --- I like this bra because it fits me so well, but also because the fabric is so breathable--no cotton, so it dries fast!  It is really stable so I actually use mine instead of a sports bra, because sports bras suck.  If I could, I would people the lingerie world with these bras. The only problem a lady might have with this bra is sheerness-related:  Don't wear it with a sheer shirt!  I wish there were another version, "Opaque Tapestry," maybe.  Then I'd never buy any other bra
So, if it's such an excellent game, why 4 stars on "fun" rating? ---  --- Well, it's a very very fun game, but some parts can get annoying and aggravating. And it seems as if the different levels of difficulty are achieved by handing you less and less health upgrades, which is kinda cheap, if you ask me. They physically limit you, instead of strategicly doing so. ---  --- But everything else is great about it. Graphics are great, not excellent, but great. Sound is great too. Gameplay is excellent and the story is very well developed. Kinda on the easy side in normal level, though. But, I guess nothing is perfect. ---  --- Go ahead and get this one. It's worth what it costs
...not much more...for us, at least.  we were so excited by the idea of this product and the orange/burgandy colors!  but when it come down to it, we just couldn't ever adjust it comfortably enough for ourselves or the baby.  we used and liked a hand-me-down baby bjorn and "breast friend" sling much better.  sigh, such a waste of a pretty sling.  ;-
Feeling more than a bit fleeced by McAfee's overpriced "subscription" renewal every year, I decided to give Kaspersky a try.  Installation went smoothly and everything seemed fine for 2 or 3 weeks.  Then one day my computer would not boot---just stalled on a blank screen right after the Windows XP splash screen.  When trying to boot up in safe mode, a list of the drivers currently loading scrolled down the screen.  It stopped at a file called kl1.sys and hung there forever.  A little research at work showed that this was a Kaspersky file.   ---  --- It may be just a coincidence that my system suddenly went kaput shortly after installing the new antivirus program, but I doubt it.  Attempts to use a recovery disk failed.  A trip to the local computer shop revealed that the data on my hard drives (which were in the inscrutable RAID 0 format) could not be recovered (unless I wanted to ship them to a recovery shop, and nothing on them was worth that much).  So they're going to reinstall windows, I'll have to do reinstall a shipload of software when I finally get my computer back, and, yes, I'll lose all the data that was on there.  (Gee, good thing I backed up all the kids' photos---well, most of them.  Thanks, Kaspersky!) ---  --- Anyway, perhaps my attempts at recovering the OS caused the worst of this.   Whatever the case, I believe the boot failure was caused by either the Kaspersky file being corrupted or a virus.  Who knows.  Kaspersky is to blame in both scenarios.  I do know one thing: I am not going to tempt fate by loading this program on my computer again. ---  --- And Kaspersky has yet to respond to my e-mail.  I got an automated "we received your e-mail" response, but nothing more, even though they state that they usually respond within a day or two.  That was over a week ago.  If in fact their software is in no way responsible for my computer flaking out on me, then I still do not apologize for the one-star rating, given their horrible customer service. ---  --- If you decide I'm insane or that this was just a fluke, at least do yourself a favor and make a decent boot disk for yourself before installing this product.  That might mean the difference between losing data/spending $$$ and just being inconvenienced.  And don't expect much assistance from Kaspersky should things go wrong.
I bought these for my husband, and he loves them.  The material is soft and comfortable, and they keep his feet warm.  They are also easier to slip on and off than his previous pair of slippers.  He wears 11 1/2 wide, so I got him the XL pair, and they fit him well
I like this because it is a nice construction.  I bought the white and it blends in nicely.  I just wish it was a little higher.  We have a newer construction home and the bathroom counters are high so it is still too low for her to wash hands by herself for now. 
I received these seat covers as a birthday gift and one of them did rip at the seam (also shortly after they were installed). I came on here to order another and after reading that someone else had the same problem I know not to waste my money. They are very unique and I do like the looks of them but only wish they were better quality
I have one and Panasonic doesn't have driver or processing downloads for it or even respond to requests. The proprietary video format requires special handling in your PC and can leave you with a camera full of useless clips.  Are they abandoning this product? Look on the Panasonic website and see for yourself
We subscribed to this for a school fundraiser. The first issue came November 13 with many useful  coupons, ONLY they expired in October 2006! I wish I could get my money back on a useless magazine filled with alot of advertising. If you want a decent health magazine, try PREVENTION. They have alot more to offer than this rag. Save your money, I wish I had!Take the time to search around. I hope this saves someone from making the mistake I had
I've a Norton user for many years.  I 'upgraded?' from NAV 2005.  This product was a pain to install.  I had to uninstall Zone Alarm, which isn't noted anywhere.  I've never had to do that before.  The installation process required rebooting multiple times.  In the past it had been an easy process.  Not anymore!  I will not buy Norton in the future
An excellent project for your child's school report.  We purchased the Velociraptor kit for our 8 year old daughter not knowing what to expect. After opening the package my wife came up with the clever idea of pouring melted chocolate chips into the dinosaur molds, instead of using the plaster mix that comes with the kit. We experimented with white chocolate chips and created realistic looking dinosaur bones! We buried these edible bones in ground up Oreo Cookies.  What a thrill to see our daughter's 2nd grade class excavate these delectible prehistoric fossils!  We can't wait to purchase other kits in the Eyewitness series
Yes, the magazine is great...  but up to 1/3 of the pages are ads.  They will shamelessly load you up with renewal letters.  And occasionally, you get a big stinky AOL disk in with your issue.  Kinda like someone dooking in your cheerios.  Welcome to the mainstream media
My last Braun Razor was model 6550, which I purchased 7 years ago. The Braun 8975 is a pleasure using, quick and close shave. The technology has come a long way. I have always used Braun and this is by far the best yet.
Good baby monitor overall.  Sound quality is good except we are getting an occasional clicking sound and I can't find where the interference is coming from
This is only the second pair of binoculars I've owned but I've used many pairs before from low end to relatively high end ones like Nikons and Leicas.  I can say without hesitation that the Canon 18X50s have met all my expectations for clarity, build quality, and ease of use. They are still quite heavy so, you won't be holding them too long in one position but, the stabilization feature provides a stable, gitter free image. In my opinion, this feature makes up for optics that may not be in the same league with the high end stuff: the Canon 18X50s have more usable magnification for the money for non-tripod, hand held applications.  ---  --- While this is not a scientific comparison, this is an example of the useability and magnification: I was at the beach looking at a parasailer in the distance - with the naked eye (20/20 for the record), I could see the chute pattern and a black speck below it; with my old Minolta 10X50s (jittering in my hands)I could make out shapes of heads and legs; with the Canon 18X50s, I could clearly see two people, a man and a child as well as the chute's cords - pretty impressive.   ---  --- My only two gripes that have also been mentioned before are: no lense caps and the eye cups are stiff, fit poorly (to my face any way) and are uncomfortable. I find it better to fold the cups back for "eye glass" use even though I don't wear glasses.  Other than that, I am very pleased with this purchase and would also highly recommend purchasing from Adorama Camera - they are quick, accommodating and responsive.
I'm surprised by all the praise this movie gets here at Amazon and beyond. There really wasn't much here I liked. The soundtrack was the usual "pap" you'd expect from a family friendly movie, though the sets were nice. It seems this movie was just miscast. Mel just doesn't do comedy all that well, at least for a lead role. Jame Garner, the reason I bought this seems more like a bystander. And Jodie is Jodie and I never bought for a moment she was her character.  ---  --- Although the cast is a powerhouse (on paper), sadly the chemistry never really works and the jokes are just cornball. An example: There was a sequence when Bret asks his friends (who are standing behind him) to whistle to reveal themselves to some bandits he was confronting; which as it turns out they are unable to do. Instead Jodie and James, blow madly, just like the movie. ---  --- This movie reminds me a HELL of a lot like ''The Three Amigo's''; on paper you would think it couldn't miss, but on film it's painful to watch
This italian gift basket,captures the feeling of italy,at it best...When you send this to family or friends,they will definitly,feel the love and warmth,of italy,and is sure to please...5 star recommended..
These lovely little gems are perfect for those women who, like me, have a second or third ear piercing. Small enough to be dainty but large enough to be seen without being unnecessarily ostentatious.  --- These would make a great gift for a little girl as well.I particularly liked the price point where they were being offered as I suffer from a nickel allergy and always wear gold posts in my ear. Having recently transitioned from yellow to white gold these were lovely additions to my collection. At the price of under 10 dollars I was able to give them to a few others as a little hi there, how are you.
Corny science fiction less favorite of mine not even in the top 10 !  --- Afi took the idea on a better approache of this movie about a boy robot !
Of all the many Swiss Army Knives I own, this is the most used.  Not only is the Pocket Pal small enough to easily carry in a front jean's pocket, its simplicity makes it perfect for quick use for fruit peeling, paper cutting, and a whole host of tasks
 --- It is a shame that such a good magazine lacks so much in customer service.  I subscribed  in 2005 and only received one (1) issue which was informative, well structured  and beautifully illustrated.  When i e-mailed the company to find out what had happened with the rest of my subscription, --- Roseanne Tully's (CEO & Publisher to Intermezzo Magazine) response to my inquiry was that the next publication would be sent immediately and that "the rest of the 6 issues would be delivered even if it takes more than a year".  To date, i have not received a single issue since i made my complaint in March nor have i received a refund.   --- If you're a foodie as myself, and like to keep up with the trends in the culinary industry;  what good is it to subscribe to a publication that takes your money and does not deliver or delivers outdated magazines
My child LOVES Geotrax and plays with them everyday.  However, Big City Lights makes your track look good but doesn't have much for a child to interact; the crane has a crank to turn but the bricks are hard to get to stick in the clamp and besides a button for sounds that is about all this has to offer.  Unlike other pieces with Geomotion this one is a bore.  My child rarely plays with this piece except to watch the RC trains go under it.
This is like hot sauce concentrate.  You MUST dilute it to use it.  Do not try to eat this stuff straight or you will be miserable for hours, and then some.  Lets just say it burns both ways.  A teaspoon in an entire crock of chili will make the chili hot enough to be near inedible, and I like very hot and spicy foods.  Five or six drops is probably more than enough for an entire dish.  Tabasco isn't even comparable to this, because no amount of tabasco would make a dish that hot.  This is truly the hotest sauce I have ever had, I think it killed my tastebuds (slight sarcasm). ---  --- Wash your hands thoroughly after use as there will often be residue on the lid.  If you rub your eyes they will burn for a long time, and I would suggest flushing them with water for about 10 minutes if you have the unfortunate experience. ---  --- The first listed ingredient is habaneros
Opened the enclosure, plugged in my hard drive, connected it to my PC, and it worked. Simple as that. ---  --- I spent a whole 10 seconds realizing that the instructions provided showed that I had to remove a single screw from the back panel when I really had to remove two screws, but that was the only (very minor) problem. ---  --- There is no fan in the case, which means the only noise is from the hard drive itself. I am assuming the case itself acts as a large heatsink, but I havent yet monitered temperatures on the hard drive itself. ---  --- I am pleased with the enclosure, and would happily recomend it to anyone
There is nothing wrong with the knife itself but there is a major design flaw. The ring to attach the knife to say a set of keys is on the wrong side; so the open knife is not away from the set of keys. This is the first swiss army knife I have ever come across with this flaw. So alway make sure the ring is opposite the swiss army logo!!
After reading a review here mentioning subscription issues I went directly to American Artists web site and ordered a subscription. That was November 23, 2005 and now Feb. 10, 2006 still no magazine. When I finally complained I got a request to send my credit info again to vnu@espcomp.com. Can't say from looking at that address that I have confidence I was communicating with American Artist or a magazine publisher. Would you send your credit info...I think not. I'd say don't blame Amazon as a previous reviewer did.  Hey, the magazine is good if you can get a subscription
I cannot say how well this product really compares to other sunscreens in terms of sun protection. But it does have the right ingredients that most top-rated sunscreens/sunblocks use, so it should be at least on par with them. ---  --- Where this product really shines (or DOESN'T shine) is for people with combination/oily skin. I have tried MANY sunscreens, and it's so hard to find a sunscreen WITHOUT moisturizers (if you have oily skin, that's already your natural moisturizers). ---  --- I have even tried other NEUTROGENA sunscreens that are supposed to be OIL FREE and all that. The result on my face? After applying it, I always SHINE (which is NOT what I want). ---  --- This magnificent product, however, actually gives my face a nice MATTE finish... and matte FEEL, too! It's a pretty thick cream when you first apply it (as opposed to other suncreens or other products that feel more like LOTION), but is almost immediately absorbed by the skin. In 30 seconds, there is no more greasy/creamy feeling, and in one minute, if you feel your skin, there's a nice matte feel. ---  --- HOWEVER, and this is not the fault of the product, after about 3 hours (at least for me), then I feel like the matte effect has worn off, and my oily skin is again showing its oily nature. ---  --- Still, as far as suncreens go, this is the best I have tried for my skin, and I highly recommend it for people with combination/oily skin. ---  --- BTW, this review is for the actual product I got, which is SPF 30. As of the time I am writing this review, here in amazon they also offer an SPF 45 version, and cheaper, too! I don't know the difference, but I always go for the LOWER one (in this case, SPF 30), because I theorize -- rightly or wrongly, I don't know -- that the lesser the SPF, the lesser the strength of the ingredients, so maybe it's better for sensitive skin (?)
Always lively and perspicacious, this clever book seeks to solve a seemingly trivial puzzle: while historians have mustered a host of plausible explanations (weapons, diseases, horses, etc.) for why Europeans spread so thickly into North America, Australia, New Zealand and Argentina (the lands Crosby labels "Neo-Europes"), what could possibly explain why the dandelion did so as well? The question doesn't appear so innocuous when it is pointed out that not just the dandelion, but the European housefly, and feral pigs, and a horde of other weeds, pests, crops, diseases and livestock from Europe followed suit. Quite often these organisms, even the domesticated ones, raced ahead of European explorers themselves, rapidly proliferating into vast herds and stands that the settlers themselves could not fathom. Why was this so? Why didn't, say, Australian weeds, their seeds inadvertently shipped back to England, eventually carpet the meadows and fields of Europe? To answer this odd question, Professor Crosby begins his story with Pangaea--the great supercontinent that began to split apart about 200 million years ago into the continents we now have scattered about the globe. These "seams of Pangaea" then forced a radical divergence in the terrestrial flora and fauna of the planet, and set the stage for the equally radical convergence initiated when European mariners crossed these now mid-oceanic seams. Crosby details case after case in each category: weeds, pests, livestock, diseases and crops. He forcefully illustrates how sudden and overwhelming the ecosystem takeover was until the suspense is too much to bear. What is the answer? He drops clues every now and then, and the most explicit one is in the form of a quote that begins one of the final chapters: if weeds are to be defined as those organisms that thrive on the disturbances caused by humans, then humans themselves must be considered the primary weed of all. Here, then is the answer: all the opportunistic fellow-travelers of the European diaspora are exquisitely coadapted to the scale and pace of the continuous ecological disequilibrium characteristic of the Old World civilizations--and they, in turn, furthered and helped generate that very disequilibrium. Together--humans, horses, cattle, pigs, rats, clover, peaches, measles and, yes,  dandelions--comprised a potent self-replicating system, dimly discerned by its contemporaries, that could not be stopped once it spilled across the seams of Pangaea
Our book club read this book for our February 2006 selection.  It was a really good book, we were all excited about discussing it.  Mr. Johnson sent us discussion questions that really made us think. ---  --- A few members felt that Denmark never loved Sierra but saw her more as property.  The book definitely has some suprises that you don't see coming.  We really enjoyed the book. ---  --- Sistahs of Ebony Pages
This has got to be one of the worst films I've ever seen. The characters are pointless and one-dimensional. The guy is a jerk and inspires no sympathy. They have sudden fights over apparently nothing. In fact, there is no cause-and-effect in this movie at all! Things just happen randomly for no apparent reason. There's no real story. The takes are boring; most scenes hum along endlessly making for quite boring viewing. The violent ending wasn't even believable! Instead of inspiring any kind of shock or sympathy, I was left just thinking "what the...???" Really, really pointless all around
I've been using SweetLeaf SteviaPlus for about 3 weeks now, and I'm so glad I decided to try it. I was worried about the research coming out about aspartame; and Splenda... well, it just does terrible things to my stomach. I simply can't use it. So I started doing some web-searching and learned about stevia. I liked the fact that it was natural and used extensively in other countries, such as Japan. But I still kept my expectations low... it sounded too good to be true and I figured it would taste awful. I ordered SweetLeaf SteviaPlus and to my surprise and delight, I love the taste. It's sweet, and no bitterness. Now I'm a person who is used to using artificial sweeteners, so someone who uses only sugar might have a different opinion, but I did share it with a coworker to use in his tea, and he really liked it as well. So, don't be afraid to try it if you haven't already. I notice that I'm feeling a lot better lately. Maybe it's the switch from artificial sweeteners to stevia. At any rate, I'm happy with it, and I recently placed another order for both packets and tablets
My mother lives in a rural part of the country in Ohio (she is a native of Thailand) anyway being in a small town, it is not easy to find Thai anything, this makes it so easy to send a little taste of home to her, at her front door.  Prompt shipping and packing
I tried putting this on a shopping cart from Target.  This does not cover area at all!!  I caught my baby biting on the cart handle and almost flipped! ---  --- Not good... Plus its annoying to put on
If you are trying to learn relaxation through biofeedback, this is the product to buy. Packaging, support, presentation, and hardware/software quality are the best that I have seen.  No down side. It's not a game in the usual sense. More of a way to learn techniques in a quiet and amusing way.  ---  --- There is room for a little mischief. Instead of allowing the balloons to flow smoothly, I tried busting a few. Type A personality shows through occasionally. I will be purchasing the next item in the series. I am learning to relax, at will, which will be helpful in my high-stress occupation. Good luck
Cannes Man was funny.  I don't know why this movie was in the drama section of Blockbuster, but it made me laugh out loud. Just goes to show that nobody knows anything in lalaland, and movies are made by a bunch of nincompoops who don't know their **s from a hole in the ground
It is probably too late to save anyone from this software but I had to say something about it to someone. There is apparently no way to tell taxcut about it.  --- I have been using taxcut for several years now after switching from turbotax because of the issue of them installing spyware. I was happy with taxcut until this year. It is defective. I can't even believe it isn't in the news. My taxcut program is missing the "wages" entry on the Schedule C form. It would have been a terrible loss if I had not caught it. I went to their website to get some help or a phone number and neither was available. I can't believe that I have the only taxcut software that is defective but I couldn't find any reference to this problem anywhere. Now I have to go through the whole tax form to make sure it didn't make any other mistakes! I might as well have done my taxes the old fashioned way by hand.
Seriously....I was waiting quite awhile for this game to come out because its predecessor is freakin sweet.  It was all I use to play online.  After purchasing this game and playing it for all of 10 minutes I quietly put it back in the box and have not taken it out since.  Online play was non existent.  Everytime i clicked on a game it said it didnt exist.  It was ridiculus.  Letting someone else create this game instead of Infinity Ward was a giant mistake.  This latest edition adds nothing to the series.  Do not purchase this game....there are many better games out there
The magazine was shipped in a timely manner, I would use this vendor again
  The overall impression is that of a game made on the rush. --- Assuming the "good" alignment, you win simply by building expensive  buildings at the edge of your influence zone and burning the enemy's platoons sent by a very unintelligent AI. Since winning requires no strategy, the game is challenging; you can do basically the same on all levels.  ---  ---    The races against which one fights are pretty much the same except for their "skins" and the building's aspect. Defeating them all takes you at most 8 hours of gameplay.  ---  ---   Unlike the previous version of B&W, there are no custom campaigns nor multiplayer features. Cinematics and creature apart, it looks like a very primitive first version of "Age of Empires". ---  ---  ---      ---  ---  ---    ---    ---  ---  
I purchased 5 of the Anvil SS Henleys in assorted colors not long ago.  Out of the box, they were good quality.  After 2 washes, however, they have shrunk drastically to the point that they cannot be tucked in anymore.  My personal opinion... waste of money
I'm sorry but this is one of the worst perfumes.  I seriously can spray myself about 10 times and within 30 minutes you can't smell a thing.  yes the scent is great, I love it.  But the only person who has the opportunity to smell it is me.  Really really disapointed.  I guess I'm just used to the Channel and Ralph Lauren lines.  They are quality and can last most of the day.  This stuff is plan old junk like most of the new stuff coming out these days. 
I bought this cable to connect 50" Plasma TV to computer. When we connected the cable with TV we could not get it to display computer screen. We spent 2 hours with Plasma manufacturer on telephone troubleshooting the connection. At the end, at our dissapointment, we found out that the cable was defective. When we tried different cable everything worked
Everyone in my family is enamored with this fantastic Darth Vader mask. We bought it initially for my son, who is Darth Vader obsessed, but it's quickly become the house favorite. (Even Grandpa can't resist putting this mask on and pretending to be Darth for a spell.)  ---  --- On another note: we keep this helmet on our bookshelf in the living room and it makes a great conversation piece. It is so realistic looking and it makes a menacing piece of art on display
Although this isn't the most polished movie, it is genuinely entertaining, and only someone not remotely interested in seeing a romantic comedy would give it 0-1 stars. ---  --- I can't remember why I first picked it up (I didn't see it in the theaters), but it is a consistently funny, touching film.  I'm not a fan of Sarah Jessica Parker, Elle MacPherson (who I feel turns in the strangest, poorest performance of the bunch), or even Ben Stiller, but I think it's easy to identify with people so afraid to be in love, but so afraid not to be in a committed relationship. ---  --- All in all, it's a bunch of laughs, and kind of a relief to watch something that takes itself less seriously than some of the big-name romantic comedies that are put out today and fall flat
I love my coffee machine but I normally do not buy t-discs from Gevalia due to price.  But found this on Amazon = Wow 2 for 1!  --- Price is great, even when you add in any cost for shipping etc.  Still beats "Bead Bath & Beyond" with a coupon!  Service and delivery were excellent
This Yakima roof rack system works great and I highly recommend it. The Fairing definitely makes the ride a lot quieter, anyone who doesn't like "wooshing" should buy one without hesitation. I bought one for my Mazda 3 and have used it, along with a Yakima roof rack for 2 cross country ski trips (I live a Florida, skiing is far away). The rack hasn't shifted an inch and was relatively easy to install. Yakima has a product guide on their site to make sure you order the right pieces for your model car
Which was Nomadland.  The Bono-pod is beautiful.  However the inconsistency of the iPod itself is a nightmare.  I've had it just over a month now and it has started to randomly skip songs.  It's apparently a known problem with several models of the device, with no particular fix.  Great. 
Not only are these shoes great looking on...they are extremely comfortable.  I went back and bought two addtional pairs in different colors
The projection was too small and not bright enough.  The clock was a pain in the neck to set.  I have many of these type clocks and this one was a dissapointment.  I returned it
I ordered this cushion for my rather large desk chair at work- and it works great!  The foam is very thick, but conforms to the body to support it well.  The cushion is tapered at the front to prevent pressure on the legs.  I would highly recommend this to improve posture and support while working at a desk.  I am buying a second one to keep at home so when I work at my kitchen table on my laptop I am at the proper height.   ---  --- I also am an adult with ADHD Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and find this cushion allows me to sit for longer periods of time without becoming restless.  I also used to find myself sitting on my leg or heel, but with the cushion I am better at keeping both feet on the ground while I am sitting at my desk or table. ---  --- Kensington makes great products- I also love the Kensington laptop stand for my desk at school that I also ordered on Amazon as well
I agree that this is technically an excellent film.  But it is also unrelentingly grim and without a payoff of any kind.  Given the lowlifes who inhabit this story its hard not to sympathize a bit with Richard Widmark's character.  His enthusiasm is as boundless as his optimism.  But in the end he doesn't just lose; he is literally thrown away as garbage.   ---  --- And then there is the wrestling scene which was so gruesome it was hard to take.  All in all, I was left with the question, what is the point? ---  --- The commentary leaves a lot to be desired as well.  Its basicly a description of what you're watching, while you're watching it. ---  --- I see everyone regards this as a masterpiece so I'll watch it again but as film noir goes there is something very unsatisfying about this movie. 
I absolutely love this magazine! This is a wonderful read for any who like short stories and mysteries! The magazine includes new writers as well as more well known ones. A wonderful magazine
This is a minimalist kit which isn't really suited for everyone, it is also overpriced for the items in it. What it is good for is to get you thinking what YOU need in your survival kit and to understand that you can make it very compact. Overall it's a good starting point and a lot better then nothing
The price is too high, considering the Ijoy 550 model is only US$599.99 at Sharper Image
The watch obviously looks nice and the links have a nice, unique design. Unfortunately I have had terrible issues with the pins between the links. There are multiple links that wiggle out throughout the day and I have to shimmy them back in all day long. I tried having this issue addressed with a jeweler but it didn't last. This is the kind of issue I would expect from an inferior watch, perhaps one well under 100 bucks.
One warning for users with over head lights.  The 6000 keyboard that has tranparent (light gray) keys is very hard to read if the lighting is not quite right.  I have a light directly above my desk  and the reflected glare off the keys makes all the letters and numbers disappear.  Go for a black key or similar model
You can try this for free for up to 60 days by registering with Microsoft and downloading an evaluation copy. When you're sure you want it, permanently activate it with the product key you get in your Amazon package. ---  --- The new version of Excel has two huge advantages: ---  --- 1. It removes the old 256 column/65,536 row limitation.  You can now have 16,384 columns and more than a million rows.   ---  --- 2. Excel 2007 can use all the cores/processors in your computer (or you can restrict it to use only some, so huge background calculations do not tie up your machine).  On my dual core computer, Excel 2007 is **way** faster than 2003 at almost every task. ---  --- I've seen no crashes, hangs, or hiccups. ---  --- But everything else about Excel 2007 is frustrating.  The new "ribbon" interface is unnecessary and awkward -- almost every operation takes more pointing and clicking than older releases. Bypassing the ribbon with the new "Quick Access Toolbar" is problematic because (bizarrely) Microsoft has deleted many distinctive command icons, leaving them with identical green circles. ---  --- Right now Excel 2003 costs more than Excel 2007.  If the two plusses don't help you, you may think that 2003 is worth more
I currently have two feeders in the back yard for the hummingbirds.  I love the way this one looks but the birds don't feed from it and I'm not sure why.  The other one will be empty and they still don't come to this one
nice shirt.  very hard to find in stores so it's worth the wait and the cash
I was very excited to get these bowls in the mail because they are so cute, and the concept of having a suction bowl was (and is) appealing to me. My son loved the bowl right away, as he was able to reach into the bowl for some puffs to feed himself instead of having to push the puffs around the table until he could finally grab one in his fingers. I'd also like to add that he ate tofu cubes for the first time out of this bowl and loved them! However, I'm disappointed because the suction on the bowl does not work for more than a few seconds. I'm constantly pushing the bowl back down, which is disruptive to his meal. Despite some of happy memories I've had with this bowl, I would not recommend buying these bowls because as 'suction bowls' they do not serve their purpose
I was overwhelmed by the choices, and selected this model, in part, because of the reasonal price.  I had read reviews which mentioned problems and the need to return the product, but I decided there was only a small possibility of that happening.   ---  --- The instructions said to use the lowest setting initially, which certainly made sense.  However, the INSTRUCTIONS said to move the adjustment "toward the tip", which turned out to be the highest, not the lowest setting!  The diagram on the handle indicated that the movement was toward the LARGER opening, but I read the directions and did not look at the diagram until later.  The spray was very powerful and actually "hurt", especially when it was by my tooth with a crown.   ---  --- The next day I tried adjusting the settings with the pik over my sink, not in my mouth!  It felt wonderful on the lower setting!  I reread the directions again (and again over the next several days) to see if the error was mine or theirs.  I still think the directions were not written properly.  The third day I had trouble getting any spray at all.  This continued for about a week, some days getting more or less, but never a full spray ON ANY SETTING!  My guess is that it was in a permanent "pause" mode. I gave up and pursued returning the item.  It needed to be returned to an "authorized repair", which luckily was only a few miles away (there were only three in my state).  The repair man had told me, over the phone, it was a discontinued model and hadn't been made in about  a year.  When he looked at it, he found it had been made in 2006.  He said he could fix it, but wasn't allowed to; I am awaiting a replacement to arrive in the mail. 
This was the second tribe album i bought i was gonna get this cd before i got the low end theory but they didn't have it at the best buy i went to. I like this cd a lot but i like midnight mauraders more because phife got some more rap time and i like phife a little more than tip. Most people like tip more but i like phifes style a lot. All like all the songs but the most is luck of lucein, afterhours, foot prints, i left my wallet in el segundo, bonita applebum, can i kick it, rhythm, go ahead in the rain, and description of a fool. Man i pratically like all the tracks but the most remeberable. I wish they were still going to make another cd but its just tip coming out with another solo cd. The only complaint is that phife was only in a couple songs. This is one of my favorite rap albums with the jazz and r and b mix with the lyrics which makes this a absoulte must have for any hip hop fan is part of the tribe classics.  
If you are only starting your trek into the world of serious coffee appreciation, then I highly suggest you, without haste, purchase one pound at least of whole bean JBM. Also a good grinder, a temperature controlled machine and a decent water filtration system. Pre-ground takes much of the flavor away, compaired to properly done fresh home ground coffee, and coffee is lessened without being prepaired at the correct temperature of filtered water. ---  --- But why something so expensive? Why jump in to the deep end of the pool before even getting your feet wet?  ---  --- Some may scoff, saying that only a true coffee fanatic would understand or be able to appreciate this blend. That is entirely true. But how can anyone really understand without first having tasted the standard by which all others must be judged? ---  --- Thus why this review is only four out of five stars. You see, JBM is so subtle, so complex, that a new tounge will not notice what makes JBM quite so wonderful. ---  --- It is a "perfectly" blended coffee. Flavor, bitterness, acidity and aftertaste. On a scale of one to ten, they all rank dead even at five. Every other coffee is like a exaggeration of this hard to get bean. ---  --- This should be the first coffee to ever cross the lips of anyone who wants to learn these things. How else can you truely understand the other blends
To begin, I am not a big fan of Cary Grant, EXCEPT in his Hitchcock movies, where he was excellent. And I enjoy him much with Katharine Hepburn in Bringing Up Baby. He was very good in The Eagle and the Hawk with Fredric March. He was tolerable in The Philadelphia Story and Talk of the Town. A friend of mine loaned me this DVD; she just bought it. I had wanted to see what Cary would do in this film, and I wanted to see him in the dress. From the start, the movie was SLOW and BORING, all the jokes were so lame and not at all funny. I also don't go for films where the man and woman yell at each other and dislike each other, and then at some point realize it is really love they feel for each other. Come on! I just can't understand that sort of romance situation. I felt Cary showed that "mean streak" he can show in some of his films, in the romance situation of this story. I rate this one star because it was one of those films you get bored with right from the beginning and it is sort of torture waiting for it to finally end. All the while I kept saying, "Let's move along, let's end this thing, when does he put on the dress?..." but they dragged it out on and on and on and on with boring,corny jokes. And the part we wanted to see, Cary in the dress, was at the VERY end and not very much at that. Overall, this film was a real disappointment and letdown. The only consolation was that I saw it for free; I didn't have to buy it or rent it. Still, I wasted good time that I could have used in a more profitable and enjoyable way. I would even have enjoyed washing a kitchen full of dirty dishes more than watching this movie!  To sum it up, a VERY VERY BORING and DUMB movie, not to waste your time on.
This little device is easy to put together and easy to use.  Not for 'intensive' workouts however, you can pretty much use it anyplace you're sitting down.  That could mean even while the TV is on!  Like all exercise equipment, if you don't use it you lose it
What happened to this book?  It is a disgrace to the star wars universe.  It's practically a Star Wars dictionary, that's all.  In spite of the good pictures, this book was very disappointing!!!
These little flosser tips put an end to my problem with bleeding gums.  Flossing with traditional floss hurt because I always cut myself and deeply.  It probably saved me from serious gum disease, and that I understand is expensive to treat, so I'd rather put out a few dollars rather than a few thousand dollars in keeping teeth and gums healthy
We bought this dollhouse, because when we went to the store, it had an adorable display and looked like a step up from the Twintime Dollhouse, which has very small rooms.  You could press the button on the display, and the people would talk to each other.  My kids thought it would be great.  When we were at Toys R Us, I looked for accessory furniture/people/animal sets to go along with this dollhouse.  I did not see any.  I thought it was probably due to Christmas just having passed.  We got home, opened the dollhouse and discovered that there really were not many phrases that the provided people/furnitureanimal did, so I went to Amazon to try to find more sets in order to achieve the purpose of this dollhouse (to get the 200 phrases). Thats when reality set in that we had just made a huge mistake.  You cannot find ANY accesory pieces for this set.  You can go on Ebay and pay many times more than the original price for USED furniture.  I was really disappointed.  I even tried the Fisher Price website, only to find that they are marketing the Twintime Dollhouse furniture for this Sweet Sounds Dollhouse.  What a shame and a sham....  I really like Fisher Price toys and we have many, but I am very disappointed in the fact that they are trying to fool the consumer.  What good is a dollhouse, if you cannot get it to accomplish what it says it will do---200 phrases.  Not to mention, what is included with the Sweet Sounds Dollhouse is not much.  Just a Mom, Dad, girl, baby, swing, cradle, radio, cat, and a scant few more pieces.  Definately not enough to keep the kids interested for long! ---  --- There are actually three Fisher Price dollhouses that are still available, this one, the Twintime Dollhouse, and the one we eventually ended up buying at Value City (also available on Ebay)--the Fisher Price Special Edition Townhouse.  It has a doorbell that rings, doors that open, birds that sing, phone that rings, lights that come on, fridge light comes on, computer lights up(and is part of a desk set attached to the dollhouse), and a fireplace that crackles and lights up (which is also attached to the dollhouse).  These things are all ON THE DOLLHOUSE itself.  No accesory furniture or people are needed to make this happen.  The battery replacement compartment is on the back on this dollhouse not the bottom, like the Sweet Sounds one.  The front of the Townhouse has flower boxes with likelike flowers you place in them (comes with the set).  You can get it A LOT cheaper than the Sweet Sounds Dollhouse, too (almost half the cost). It comes with a great deal of furniture:  2 beds with pillows and comforters and blankets, a lawnchair, 3 people, potted plant, real curtains, kitchen table and chairs, clothing for the people, computer chair, lounge chair and more.  The kitchen counter, stove, microwave and fridge are part of the dollhouse.  It also has closet doors that open and stairs the people can walk up.  You practically do not need to buy anything else, but if you do, you can get the Loving Family accesory people and furniture sets.  This dollhouse is so much larger to boot.  There is plenty of room to put everything. It shuts and closes together just like the Sweet Sounds, but it is clearly larger.  We also thought about the Twintime, but it had too many comments on how small the rooms were and the display at Toys R Us looked jammed packed.  I did not know how more than one child could play with it and not have a shoving match, because they could not play, as well. ---  --- My kids absolutely the Townhouse with all of its sounds, especially the doorbell.  The great thing about it is that these are greatly reduced in price, because they are an older model, which is what they should do with the Sweet Sounds Dollhouse.  Let the public know ahead of time, so their kids do not get disappointed, because it does not live up to what it says at the store. Thank Goodness I was able to take mine back, because I had my receipt and box.  Be careful and keep the box and receipt if you do choose to buy this dollhouse even after all of the warnings, because after your kids see that it does not do what it says and because it is on the small side compared with the Townhouse version, they may not want to keep it. When we took ours back, a Toys R Us worker stopped and talked to us and agreed that Fisher Price is just trying to get rid of their extra stock of Sweet Sounds Dollhouses. Unfortunately, it is at the consumers expense and disappointment!! 
This is our first fire pit, and it seems to work great.  It is not too heavy so it can be moved around our patio and it looks nice.  The only downside, and I think this is true of all firepits, is that the bowl fills up with water when it rains and makes quite a mess in there.  I find myself cleaning the bowl more often than I'd like, but otherwise is a great
All of the bags were stale, however Amazon's customer service quickly corrected the issue by giving me a refund. I think the whole batch was stale
I always thought the laborious interviews in turbotax were pretty ridiculous, now I've seen the opposite. Taxcut online seems totally not thorough, such as just asking for total of certain things, and not asking if special circumstances apply, which you don't miss at all until you have one of them. I had almost completely finished my taxes and got to the business use of home. I moved half way through the year. I couldn't find where to add an additional home office listing. "Nope, can't do it" said support after an hour long chat session of mostly waiting, "you'll have to use another product." So today I start from scratch and pay the $99 ransom that turbotax is charging small business owners. I encourage the competition to get their shizzle together next year. --- s:
I ordered this magazine on 10/7/06 (over three months ago) and haven;t received a single copy yet!!! STINKY SERVICE!!
Drills are excellent, vocabulary has good variety... Picking up the grammar from the application without explanation is tough for me, but I guess that's the way kids learn any language.
I absolutely love Atlantis. From Ronon Dex, to Sheppard, and to all the faces. I'd cry if Atlantis was cancelled. Seriously though, Steve should have never have died, he should also have been put in command of SG1. Can you imagine that..."Why Steve, welcome to Earth...you're welcome to live out your life, if you only feed in self defense on enemies...'kay? Oh, you're also in charge of Sg1. :P" But seriously, the Wraith make this show so awesome. From Steve to Bob to Edward, to Gordon and Alexander, to Michael and Eric (by far James's best performance yet). ---  --- The Wraith make this show what it is. But one thing??? Why don't we have Before I Sleep? Seriously, you have no idea how irked I am at that, since I began watching in S.2.12. ---  --- Anyways, I think Atlantis totally pwns SG1
Very nice bag and well made.   ---  --- However, I bought it for the Canon DC100 DVD camcorder and found it a little small for carrying all the equipment (cords and charger). 
If you are looking for complete information about the training or fitness activity and want to analyze to improve your performance or avoid overtraining this is the unit. --- - Very nice software, a lot of nice information very well presented --- - Speed sensor is reliable and accurate (does not suffer all kind of interfence such as GPS units) - error is really smaller than 5% even during long runs --- - The information available during and after the exercise is great (temperature, altitude, calorie count, all HRM metrics such as average, maximum, %) --- - Bike sensor provides speed, distance, etc --- - Fitness test is a nice measure of improvemen
The magazines ordered through amazon take an ETERNITY to be delivered.  The estimated time for my delivery was April after I had placed the order in Feb.  That's a long enough wait as it is---I ended up receiving it the the end of June!  And when I called to complain...the customer service rep explained to me that it was technically within the estimated allowed time for delivery.  so bottom line...if you have an urge to order a magazine that may take half a year or so to get to you...then this is the ONE FOR YOU-hands down.  I plan on never ordering a single magazine through Amazon again.  Definitely don't send a subscription to anyone as a birthday gift- it'll maybe make it in time for the FOLLOWING birthday year..so plan years in advance
My daughter bought this with birthday money and it jammed on the first day she played with it. We can't get the sticker roll out and she is very disappointed. Don't bother with this toy. Buy a better one made for scrapbooking. The look on my daughter's face when this broke was heart-breaking
The videos are not useable except in the Leapfrog Leapster.  I did not know that until I received the order!  Thanks alot Leapfrog.
After looking at $250.00 mounts, I was unsure about order at this low price.  This is a great, well built unit. I would have no problem putting --- a 130 lb. unit on it if you follow the enclosed instructions.  Hardware  --- for most walls included.  Well painted with no rough edges.  Mine was installed over wall board into wood studs.  I used the awl to make sure I hit the studs dead center. Delivery from New York to Sarasota, Fl. was 5 days.  Can't bet that
Ok, I don't have this doll, I won't buy this doll...If I ever have a little girl she will never have anything like this. I saw some girls saying how the doll was appropriate for 10-13 and I almost fell out of my chair! This doll is -IN-appropriate for someone under 21! The short skirts the short tops. How the heck can Mattel think that this was a good idea? I'm 23 years old and I would NEVER dress like that NOR would I allow my CHILD to dress like that. Bottom line: SHAME ON YOU MATTEL!!
I remember listening to this years ago, and I thought I would add this to my cd library, now I know why it has been years sense I've listened to it,, very sqeaky, dull, slow paced stuff, Bob Segar makes this stuff sound like tin foil..
The book I am going to talk about is the book Arms and the Man By Bernard Shaw. I really did not like this book because it was hard for me to understand.  The reason I didn't like it was because it was challenging for me. The English was hard to understand. I liked how the writer wrote the book and I would probably look for another one of his books. This book was more like an opera with out music. If I could have and known to I probably would not have this enthusiastic about the book. One reason I picked the book was because it was dealing with war and I thought it would have been cool to read about war, but when I got more in to the book it was really not about war it was more about a love at war. If you're an older audience it would be a good book, or if you're looking for a good love-war story.
Our son has an especially strong startle reflex, and has to be swaddled to sleep, at all.  At 2.5 weeks, he startled being able to get out of any swaddle we did, no matter how expertly done, no matter what blanket we used.  So, at 1 hour of sleep, he'd start crying and we'd have to go in and start all over.  We searched online for actual "Swaddling" blankets and based on reviews, chose this one.  WHAT AN UTTER MIRACLE. We are in such debt to the dad who created this!  Our son is now 12 weeks old, and we use this for each nap and for nighttime sleep.  He was sleeping 6-7 hour stretches at 5 weeks, and slept 11 hours at 8 weeks.  We would never have this success without this blanket.  We've periodically tried to get him to sleep without it, but his reflex is STILL so strong that he needs it.  It took a little "getting used to" the method to get him wrapped up, but in no time we both were experts.  And the price on Amazon, with free shipping, is way better than what we paid directly through AMB.  I wholeheartedly reccommend this to all parents, especially new parents. 
I see that "Linda" has already laid down the exact same review for all the colors and all the nibs of this pen, so there's not much new I can tell you other than, (1)  To confirm what she wrote, and (2), to add a few new details. ---  --- This is an excellent introduction to fountain pens for those with hesitancy about buying one.  I've collected a few vintage and new fountain pens over the years; some of them lay in a display box, loved but unused. On contrast, you will use this pen!  It's incredibly cheap for the quality, so you get a basically positive experience (smooth flowing liquid expression) without the price, or the ultimate cost...losing the darn thing.  At prices ranging from $40 to $400 and beyond (Amazon.com sells a Namiki fountain pen for well over $4,000), the habitual loser of inanimate objects would be understandably reluctant to invest in a gold-nibbed, laquered objet-d'art, and would opt instead for this beautiful cheaply that even CALLS itself "disposable!"  ---  ---  --- It's a personal preference, but I'd opt for the fine nib over the medium if you're going to use this everyday--you'll write faster and use less ink. The medium is nice for big John Hancock-ish signatures and weighty thoughts, but you lose a little expression (those personal shadings and slight angles that even the untrained can't help but produce). The steel nib writes surprisingly smoothly, and as mentioned above, the ink doesn;t evaporate too quickly.  You can't refill the pen (it's DISPOSABLE just because of that), but you can buy several in different colors and nib sizes, and get some idea of what kind of pen suits you.   ---  --- If and when you feel like you want to purchase a re-fillable fountain pen, try for something under $50.  Levenger.com's excellent "True Writer" and the "Retro" brand pens sell for about this much.  Although those liquidy smooth gel pens have taken some over some of the non-ballpoint market, the mechanically-minded will enjoy the physics of bottle-filling a pen; others will simpy dig the tradition of using a pen with a rich history.  When it comes to fountain pens, the "P" is for panache.
This was a huge waste of money. If you have plans to make a custom animation, do not buy this.  Anime only alows you to manipulate one of their few charecters.  You can not change eye color or hair color.  If you want a good animation you have to go to one of their websites and purchase a character for $10- $20.  Their free ones are completly dumb. Using their "easy to use" bone rigging tool takes a long time to set up and use.  It took me ten minutes to make one for a stick figure. (which didn't work very well) You can't even group anything unless you buy their $180 upgraded version.  I  spent hours trying to use this, and could figure none of the above out.  It also took two weeks to get here instead of four days.  I don't recomend this to people who are looking for an easy to use animation creator.
I expected a sage or mint to come in the package when I ordered this since it was the vague green used for children but it is lacking.  I don't like bright colors so that is not where this is coming from but the color is just not right.  Kiwi is bette
What does WILD THINGS 2 have going against it from the get-go: --- A) No Denise Richards  B) No name actors  C)Being a crappy direct-to-video sequel  D)No Denise Richards NAKED . . .  ---  --- What is wrong with WILD THINGS 2 after the fact:   --- A)A script that tries to overcompensate its idiocy with more twists than a corkscrew  B)ONE sex scene -- A (weak) threesome, one of the few things even linking this to the original C)Sexy actresses who star in a sexy movie but decide not to be naked (leaving us with a body double and naked-from-behind shot) . . . Wait let me play that again! ---  --- If I seem to be dwelling a little too much on the sexuality aspects of this film maybe its because this is an EROTIC THRILLER. ---  --- Did I mention no Denise Richards?
My 3 1/2 year old son has older sisters with iPods and always wants to use them to listen to.  We bought this for him for Christmas and he calls it his iPod and he absolutely loves it.  We download new songs and stories from time to time as a reward.  We also bought the speakers for him to listen to stories or songs while going to sleep or just hanging out at home. ---  --- It's tough and durable and withstands being dropped and rough handling like a 3 year old dips out
I purchased this as a gift for my 56-year-old mother who simply can't get enough Scrabble with her friends. While I did not get the opportunity to use the product myself, she seems quite enthusiastic about its abilities. ---  --- Just make sure your opponents approve and dont think you are trying to cheat.
This fragrance is ok for the teen princesses. This scent doesn't linger and is too subtle. Not as nice as vera wang Vanity or Sheer Veil. I don't recommend this unless you are 16 and under. I gave it to my 11 year old and she loves it
This product is not what it is cracked up to be.  I ordered it, and it doesn't really work too well, i think a button with a piece of elastic would be better.  There is not enough expansion room , its just like not really using anything at all.  Sorry, but i thought the product was not that good. 
I have looked at many photography magazines - many of them are just filled with ads....not what an amateur is looking for. I wanted indepth articles, helpful tips and information to help me improve my craft. I found it here. I read every issue cover to cover and back again. I find helpful information in every issue. I highly recommend this magazine - even if you aren't purely an "outdoor" photographer
This costume kit was a great deal for the price.  My son loves it
I bought this program for my 11 yr old granddaughter and she has very quickly learned the keyboard. I wanted her to learn the correct way to type before she developed bad hunt and peck habits. So much homework now requires typed reports. She had fun with it. It's a great program!
Not only is this beauty wide, I have found the lens is very sharp to on my D200! It is built solid and focus's fast, and I don't have any problem with distortion because I use DXO Optics software and it cleans it up automaticly! Buy this lens, it is cheap for what you get
I originally bought the Blue (5 lb), Red (7 lb) and the Black (9 lb) Gripmasters for my 14 year old boys. The Blue is a little too easy for gripping but excellent for exercising the ring and little finger. The Blue was too easy for them so they did not use it so I ended inherited it. It is pretty habit forming and fun to use because the tension is light, this makes it good for use anytime, anywhere. (I have used it stuck in traffic and it is also a good stress reliever) If I had to do it again, I would have probably not bought this tension unless you have a very light grip, probably have started with the Red. Just remember that this is mainly for fingers and hand exercise so very easy to use for gripping, the challenge is working out the fingers. It is not like using the regular heavy hand grippers. It has increased my hand strength and grip just by having it with me and using it during the course of the day without planned workouts. Great product, excellent for finger or hand exercise, good quality
I gave this camera 5 stars because of it's awesome features. This camera is the perfect size for kids and you can put a video on this camera. I love this camera. I think it takes awesome pictures
This is very comfy and pretty and a great price . Try it you will be sold. I am glad I did
bad shoe for sure. it is not for running. but want a cheap shoe for some dirty yard work. this may d
This stuff is great!  Healthier and tastier than any other pasta that I've tried, (except for my mother in laws homemade)
What a beautiful magazine (full color pictures on glossy paper), and what interesting stories behind each food.  The recipes are sometimes doable, although most of the time I just like to read about the exotic ingredients in each. ---  --- A must have- makes the living room look very sophisticated
This is an excellent, general purpose microphone at a reasonable price.  I'm a classically trained vocalist, and I use the SM58 for rehearsal and "scratch" recordings.  It delivers clear, true, and warm sound under all standard conditions and requires essentially no fine tuning or signal processing.  I still prefer the crisp detail of a condenser microphone for formal demo recordings (my favorite is the Studio Projects C1), but it's hard to beat the simplicity and reliability of the SM58 for everyday use
I'm making an exception to my usual practice of not reviewing anything on amazon, due to the utter vileness of this movie.  I saw it when it came out in theaters and hated it, and then a friend purchased the DVD and convinced me to give it a second chance...  all in all, this movie ended up taking about four hours of my life that I will never get back. ---  --- The performances are thin and uneven, the plot is inconsistent, and the dialogue sounds like it was pulled from fortune cookies made by the cast of Friends.  To be fair, this movie does face several major obstacles.  It has the misfortune to depend on the "acting" of glorified Ken doll Freddie Prinze, Jr. and the vastly overrated Julia Stiles, and in addition to trying to rise above these challenges, it also attempts to survive the intrusion of Ashton Kutcher.  It fails on all counts.   ---  --- I do not hate the whole romantic comedy genre; nor do I hate the "teen" movie sub-genre, under which some would place "Down to You."  (In fact, "Can't Hardly Wait" is one of my favorite movies.)  I simply hate BAD movies, and this movie is a true abomination.  If you enjoy the experience of wanting to drill into your own skull, then by all means, buy this DVD.  If, however, you value your sanity, then please do not make the same mistake I did; stay far, FAR away from this movie
I just opened my dock kit and began to assemble and the included battery is too big for the C743 camera.  The battery must be for one of the older cameras that is bigger.  I think it's odd, as the camera dock series 3 is the correct camera dock.  I'm disappointed with my purchase and wasted the money that went toward the battery.  I don't know whether the dock works okay, because I didn't get that far.  This is my second easyshare camera and dock and I was very happy with the first one.  Now I have to buy another battery
I've used PaperPort 9 for about 3 years, currently running under Win XP. I love it, my wife loves it, I have bought it for my kids, and recommend it to others. A lawyer friend of mine raves about it. I've had no problems with it. (I had to  downlaod and install an upgrade, but more recent production probably has the upgrade already incorporated.) I download bank and credit card statements and other documents to it from the Internet; I store faxed documents in it; I scan checks before I deposit them; I use it to convert documents to pdf so I can e-mail them. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I wish it were more convenient to do a couple of things; maybe V. 10 adds those features, but for the money, V.9 is a bargain. I just wish I had a faster scanner (what do you expect for $60?) so I could get rid of more paper documents. Highly recommended as a start toward the paperless office
I also own the Bundle me w/fluffy heavy winter liner & we could not have lived without it! I was excited to see this trendy,light-weight, weather resistant version for spring. I'll admit I would not have purchased this had it not been on the wrong shelf at $39.99. My $59.99 dismay soon evaporated-it is so sleek and functional!  No more struggling with bulky snowsuits, jackets and sweaters (which never seem to fit baby anyway)  Easily unzips so as not to overheat.  LOVE the little pocket for binky.  Velcro back openings make it easy to switch to stroller (No need to buy two!)    ---  
The bed lift system is OK if all you want to do is sit up in bed and read. However, I did not like the way it bounced when trying to sleep on it and the edges or sides would collapse if you weren't centered in the bed
this has to be the best beanie that i have ever purchased...i wear it all the time, it fits perfectly and looks awesome!
My friend was very happy with them.  They are very good quality, and they fit him for the most part.  The only issue we had was the length of the arms.  They were a little too long.  Other than that, we were pleased.  They got here in time for Christmas, and they were just what he wanted
you can purchase this item at most any Walmart or K-mart ETC...for $4.99 or cheaper..toywiz is ripping people off!!!
Where are the DVDs?  I'm STILL waiting!  I want it all, but especially the second season.   ---  --- I'd rather not have them done on both sides of the disc.  I want good quality discs, not too many episodes on each, please.  However, I'll take what I can get.  Just put it on DVD, PLEASE! --- 
I bought into a subscription of this magazine sight unseen.  That was a bad decision.  After having received two issues, I continue to be disappointed.  The quality of the art & design, and products displayed overall are dreadfully amateurish and in most cases incredibly tacky. I would be hard pressed to think that anyone in pursuit of help with romanticing their home would be inspired by this magazine. 
Everything is fine, except I was a bit irritated by shedding...it leaves bristles on my face, and they get into the razor.  I hope it will pass with time, as other reviewers reported.  Foaming action is very good, and badger bristle is much more pleasent to the touch than boar. ---  --- I'll report again on this item in few months
Solid, familiar and dependable.  Although, I wish there was an option to only update the specific income information from the prior year without going through the extensive interview
This router has been in operation for about 3 weeks.  When it is functioning correctly, it is a pleasure to use.  Unfortunately, it requires almost daily power cycling to keep it running - all the idiot lights show normal operation, but there's no wired or wireless connectivity until it's power cycled
Don't buy Vista--any version, yet.  MS released it WAY too early.  Some examples why:   ---  --- * Too many hardware drivers not yet available, i.e., Creative Audigy  sound cards; Nvidia graphics cards, and Linksys wireless network components, just to mention a few.  When I contacted product manufacturers, I sensed a ho-hum attitude.  Moreover, some peripherals are totally incompatible.  Example:  My Epson Perfection 1650 scanner was rejected by Vista, so I was forced to buy a newer model (Epson Perfection 4990 Photo).  Hmmmm.  One wonders whether these sorts of incompatibilities result more by design (purposely?) than from insurmountable technological deficiencies. ---  --- *  Too many Vista compatible application updates are not yet available.  ---  --- *  The "Upgrade" versions of MS Vista (versus the "full" versions) seem to be full of bugs.  Soon after I installed Vista Ultimate, I encountered a major problem that MS tech support has been trying to resolve for over two weeks.  It is so pervasive that MS Outlook 2007 has been affected to the extent that some of its features are not available.  It appears that during the installation process, something went awry with "Windows Event Log" and the "Event Viewer."  Furthermore, the latest version (Vista compatible) of Diskeeper 2007 Pro will not launch, most likely for the same reason.  ---  --- *  It appears MS went way overboard on security features to the extent of paranoia.  Every time you click on just about anything, a pop-up will appear asking your permission to "allow" it to launch.  Very annoying, and VERY unnecessary.  It's as though MS adopted an underlying assumption throughout the development process that the average end user has an IQ of about 85.  ---  --- *  MS tech support quality has deteriorated substantially.  Most of the time when you call you will reach someone in India.  Albeit these people are very polite, they cannot think "outside the box."  Nor are they in touch sufficiently enough with the nuances of the English language, thus impairing expeditious understanding on both sides of the conversation.  Based upon my recent experience with these folks, I sense that a soccer mom could be trained as a MS tech support rep in very little time. What I mean by that is this:  During my multiple contacts with them I developed the feeling they rely totally on reading from manuals, scripts, and on-line knowledge bases.  In other words, they seem not to be able to analyze and troubleshoot problems independent of external references.   ---  --- * Bottom line:  Do NOT purchase Vista until AFTER service pack 1 is released, or whatever they happen to name their first major fix-it update package.  For now, stay with the more reliable XP versions.  I truly regret that I had to discover all of this the hard way.  It has been very costly in more ways than one.
Good quality product at very reasonable price. Postage was quick even though I'm in the UK. All round good service
Simply stated,if you want a politically correct magazine that panders to the socialistic academic minority, buy the mag. I'll pass and go online to the authors ignored and enjoy reading about the real new horizons
My problems with nextel did not stop when I canceled my service. I will get to the problems with the service. When I went to get a new phone a day before my contract expired, I of course wanted to keep my number. So as I went to get my Cingular phone (highly recommended), I had the old number switched to my new number. Today, I get in the mail my nextel statement for the month with a $200 early termination even though I had not canceled my service, but had simply got a new phone and switched my number over. This was on icing on the cake after 2 years of absolutely amazingy bad service from nextel. In my town, not a small town by any means, there are very few places that have any service. In the largest subdivision, you cannot get service anywhere. I constantly get comments from people trying to reach me that get the classic nextel line...Please hold while the nextel subscriber you are trying to reach is located. Most of the time I would not even recieve incoming calls, calls would go straight to my voice mail. Not only would I not get the calls, but often I would not even get the voice mails until days or even weeks later. When I did actually take calls (and call out), I cannot count the number of times I've had my call dropped. I recieved so many different error messages sometimes I wonder if they just spend all their time at nextel thinking of different error messages to program into their phones. That brings me to the selling point of nextel, the famed and well-loved direct connect feature. This is an absolute joke. Direct connect only works MAYBE half the time I tried to use it. Even then, in the middle of the conversation I would be greeted by the loud beep of my phone telling me I wont be talking to that person anymore. Of course, I would expect nothing less from the nextel network. Text messaging with nextel is next to impossible. If it did not take hours to send or recieve a message, it took days, or maybe didn't even come at all. The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked. Of course, when you don't have service, you don't get the internet access either. I was constantly getting the message "network not available". Calling and trying to complain to nextel is futile. Trying to get through to customer service takes forever and once you get through they do nothing. My experience with nextel has been nothing short of a disaster and I write this trying to warn anyone considering nextel. Stick with Verizon or Cingular and you will be much happier in the end. Don't make the same mistake I did.
I enjoyed this movie a lot. Hugh Jackman and Ashley Judd are both very appealing in these roles, and Greg Kinnear does a nice job with his as well - the jerk who's just so charming that you can't resist, even when you know better than to fall for it. Ellen Barkin does fine with her small role but it is weird that she is the one listed first
I bought this buggy board because I was told it was better than my previous wood buggy board (wheel kept unscrewing)... however, I have two strollers I like to use so I had to pay 30 extra dollars to get a second set of connectors to attach it to my second board.  Today I called customer service because one strap broke... I was told it is normal if you live in a cold climate - in my case Manhattan - for the rubber to snap and break...?????? - luckily my daughter was not on it at the time! I was told not to use it in cold weather... I only use it on the weekends anyway so it's not out a lot and it snapped in less than three months.  Please save yourself money and grief and get another board
For the price this is not a bad keyboard.  Here are the two major problems I have with it: ---  --- 1) The feel is nothing like a real piano.  The keys are springy and you have to apply a fair amount of pressure to hold a note. ---  --- 2) The instructions have a big sticker on them, stating that this keyboard is made of materials known to cause cancer and/or birth defects (including lead) and to "wash your hands after handling".  How on earth did this manufacturer decide to use such materials with a device that is intended to be handled a lot, very possibly by children? ---  --- It's going back... --- 
I have dyed red hair, a lot of dyed red hair. this product made no noticable difference in the shine of my hair. WIll not purchase again
I subscribe to several woodworking magazines and have subscribed to Woodworkers Journal since 1990.  Each magazine has a character of it's own with a woodworking level reflected in the complexity of the projects it presents.  This magazine is a bit more complex than, say Wood magazine.  It should be understood that some style and esthetics are usually compromised when a project is simplified.  I have one of Woodworking Journal's projects in my living room.  It is perhaps the most beautiful piece I have ever made.  If you have become an advanced amature (sp?) this magazine will give you projects that you will take pride in making and showing to others
The seams on the pillow are sharp and uncomfortable.  The extra pouches that supposedly provide additional support don't measure up.  THe snaps that should hold the ends together don't work.  Basically, it would be OK if it came with a soft cover
This is Guido Sarduci from the Royal Tuscan Office of Copyrights and Internets and I must insist that you cease any and all sales of theese so called "Tuscan Whole Milks" immediately or I will have to come there and beat you up and then my mom came upstairs and saw me fighting and she got scared and said "You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air!" I whistled for a cab and when it came near, the license plate said "FRESH" and it had dice in the mirror. If anything I could said that this cab was rare, but I though "Nah, forget it. Yo home, to Bel Air!" I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8 and I said to the cabbie "Yo home, smell ya later!" Looked at my kindom, I was finally there, I could sit on my throne as the prince of Bel Air.   Love me sum Tuscan
The screen is too small. if you want to watch it in your car, you have to cover it because the back light is too week.
My wife bought these for me and I was just putting them on my morning Cheerios like a madman and I said, "Hey, these are good...where did you get 'em?"  ---  --- "Oh, from Amazon...can you believe they were only $17.00?" ---  --- Silence. ---  --- I just looked at her, "Are you nuckin' futs? Gimme those things. I'm going to put them into our safety deposit box with our bonds, our living trusts, and my favorite Hot Wheels..." ---  --- Blueberries are good for you and I would suggest to eat them on a regular basis, but the price for these things is simply absurd. Do I look like I'm wearing my shirt that says, "STUPID"? I don't think so. I'm sure you can get frozen blueberries for less and hey, fresh is always good, and if you can't get frozen or fresh, get a Hostess Blueberry Pie. Sure it's sugary and will feel like you've got a leadweight in your stomach after eating it but the pie is only .50 cents..these little blue suckers are $17.00. That's more than my whole wedding cost. ---  --- Just kidding. I'm not that cheap. Actually, I'm not cheap at all, but I do like money and I refuse to pay $17 for some humiliated looking berries... ---  ---  --- Geesh
I have not gotten to use this swing yet, but I just wanted to say that assembly was easy and after I had it all put together I played with the toys on the tray and it was the coolest thing ever:)  I highly recommend
It's a chunk of plastic with some bits of rubber attached.  Effectively serves its purpose, but for nearly 16 bucks?!!  Puleeeeeeeease
I've had my 1 quart Stanley Thermos for over 20 years now, and this is by far, no doubt about it, the best thermos ever invented. I have poured hot coffee in this thermos in the morning prior to doing field work in the dead of winter in upstate NY.  After leaving the thermos literally sitting in the snow in -20 degree temperatures all day, at 5 pm the coffee was still piping hot. ---  --- If you need to keep liquids hot, this is the best non-electric product out there for doing it
Erewhon Rice Twice Cereal is a very flavorful, crunchy gluten free cereal. --- I highly recommend it to anyone who is on a gluten free diet. 
This album is one of the best sonic youth album...I advise everyone to listen this album...Break the circle of common popular music...This album irritates your soul and freedback your dreams..
Just listening to the samples of this new remix of "GOLD:35th Anniversary Edition ~ The Carpenters" I found it to be in my opinion sadly remixed very badly. Certainly not a tribute to the excellent talent Of Karen Carpenter and Richard as well. I wonder what Richard was thinking when he remixed these songs? As another review noticed and I agree with, is the bass on some is so loud it almost drowns out the pure excellence of Karen's deep resounding truly perfect voice. This is not a CD you want to get if you really want to appreciate the true pure sound of The Carpenters. The older CDs (if still in production or if you can find them used) "Carpenters Classics 25th Anniversary" a 2 CD disc 98:04 minute Collection remastered digitally, is a much better pick. Especially for those who remember The Carpenters when Karen was still alive and the original arrangements were nothing to mess with. The other CD's worth finding of The Carpendters especially if you like the Talent of Karen's deep resounding perfect voice, would be The CD "Voice Of The Heart" This is a hautingly beautiful collection of Love songs by Karen who lets each song touch your Heart and Soul making you feel as if you were right there as she sings each song. The other one I would highly recommend, if Christmas is your Holiday, would be "Carpenters Christmas Portrait"... "Special Edition digital version....Celebrating 70 continuious minutes of the Seasons best..." with Karen and Richard. There are 34 Carpenters songs as timeless as their sound,and 11 performances heard on this Holiday CD for the first time. These CDs are all the songs you fell in love with the first time you heard Karen sing. These are the arrangements so beautifully done with her and Richard. This new remix maybe OK if you have not been familiar with how wonderful the original songs The Carpenter's recorded and later remastered-Not Remixed- sounded. For this reason I give this 35th Anniversary remix a 2 star rating. These older CDs are how The Carpenders really won over their fans, took the Music Industry by storm and gave a generation of Music lovers reason to Love The Carpenders music and the sound they gave each song. Talent that can still win over anyone who truly appreciates the timeless talents only The Carpenters could deliver. As I more or less said in my Title for this review and taken from an old saying "if it ain't broke don't fix it!" or in this case Don't Remix it! --- 
I was a big fan of the ST1. The plot and characters were excellent, it rated up there with the best of them I would give ST1 5 stars. I saw this was on sale for a great price so I got it expecting great things. Usually sequels aren't to par with the originals so I at least expeted a 3-star movie. When i flipped on the movie i said "WOW....right where they left off" at a pretty good battle seen with the BUGS. Well, that was it I was waiting for more action. I waited....I waited...I waited and I waited...they made the plot intersting with occasional nudity but it still wasn't worth it. I don't know who's idea it was for the sequel but I hope this was their last one. I'll stick with the new Battlestar Galactic and Star Trek reruns
Despite reading bad reviews, I took a chance and purchased this item.  I got the first one, hooked it up and it quit working within two hours.  Ordered a second, it quits working within the hour.  I should have known better as others have posted the same experience.  Great concept, maybe they will get the actual product correct in the next year.  Please don't waste your time on this one now....
My sister-in-law bought this product for me after I had admired the shade (Purr, a light baby pink color) that she was wearing. I have used other MAC products before with great results, but was VERY dissapointed with this product.  ---  --- First of all, I gave this product one star because the shade does look very pretty on the lips and went very well with my skin coloring. However, this product is sticky. VERY sticky! It does not matter whether you apply a lot or very little, you still wind up with this horrible heavy feeling on your lips. Not only is it sticky, but just down right uncomfortable. When I wear a lip gloss, I want to be soft and smooth feeling. I want to be able to rub my lips together without them getting stuck together and 'dragging' so to speak.  ---  --- Also, because of this gloss' consistancy, it has a tendency to clump together on your lips and form a line of 'gunk' on both the upper and lower lip where the two meet and rest together when you have your moth closed. This will start to happen only about 15 minnutes after application. Very embarassing when you have been talking to some hot guy and then look in the mirror afterwards to discover you have gross lines on your lips!!!!   ---  --- This product seems to be popular with other viewers, however, I would never reccomend this to anyone
I just purchased the Plusdeck2c PC Cassette Desk to convert my old cassettes to MP3 files for further transfer to CD's.  The unit works great abit trying to see the exact position of the tapes while in a fast forward or reverse mode leaves a lot to be desired.  It looses it's place and you have to do some guess work to find out where the tape is actualy at, but that is only a minor problem otherwise it works great.
I gave this monopod to my boyfriend, as a gift, and it's been perfect for his use.  He videotapes his kids's baseball and softball games, and was tired of holding the camcorder for so long.  He didn't want to deal with a bulky tripod when he was getting up and down, so a monopod seemed like a great idea.  He has LOVED it!!  He says it keeps the camera very steady and it's very easy to change the height so he can use it sitting or standing.  He's no professional, but he uses his camcorder a lot, and he'll be happily using the monopod for a long time
I recently wrote a review for this item due to a launching issue. Very angry, I made numerous calls and emails to Nova. At last I was able to converse with a rep who was more than helpful and made right with all my issues. I am pleased with my outcome with Nova and the response, making sure I was a satisfied customer.  I only rate this 4 stars as I am just now using the program and am very excited with what I've been able to accomplish in the past 3 days.  Thank you Nova for your help
I purchased this camera a year ago (summer 05).  Definitely a great upgrade over the original rebel, although the new xti has a larger screen which is the one aspect of this camera that is not perfect.  There are other sites that will perform more comprehensive reviews of this camera, but after a year mine is still working perfectly
The Xbox DVD Movie Playback Kit is very easy to set up and use. All you have to do is plug the little receiver into one of the controller ports, put in a DVD and enjoy. The buttons on the remote are responsive and easy to get used to. However, the Xbox DVD system is very simple. It doesn't have any eject buttons (something mentioned many times by other reviewers) and not as many options as more expensive stand-alone DVD players. You have to keep in mind that it was made for people who already have an Xbox and don't want to shell out an extra $50 for a DVD player that has a lot of special features when all they want is to be able to watch a movie. The DVD itself runs exactly as it would on a good stand-alone DVD player. It's sort of like one of those little $100 digital cameras. There isn't anything really special about them. They just take good pictures that you can put on your computer.
My HD-DVD also does not work on the 360 add on. I tried the press OK and everything else I could think of. This disk just freezes right after the production logo when it should be going to the menu. This is the only HD-DVD disk that I've had a problem with and I have about 10 of them. I didn't purchase the Chicago disk as I already have it and didn't think it was worth the HD purchase. I did purchase the Eagles HD-DVD and it is excellent. That one also has a trick to it. It defaults to a PCM stereo file so you have to triger it to the DTS ON mode and then it is amazing. I hope its true that microsoft is working on a patch for Heart. I saw them last year and they were fantastic. Not as good as the old days but neither am I. They still surprised me that they sounded sooo good. --- **** UPDATE**** Since Amazon doesn't have acceptible response. --- E-mail from distributor IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT received 2-13-07: --- Dear Dave --- Thank you for you inquiry.

I absolutely loved this game. I couldn't stay off my computer, it was addicting. The game was long but the puzzels and clues really get you thinking, It was very entertaining and I would recommend it to everyone who loves a mystery. I can't wait until the next one comes out
I absolutely love this movie!  It's one of my favorites and I could watch it over and over.  It's got good plot, good acting and great child stars. I'd recommend this movie to ANYONE to hasn't seen it yet (if there is any such person)
I'm not really a gadget guy, and what gadgets I do have get pretty beat up. When the company gave me a Blackberry so I can "stay in touch", I needed to at least take care of the thing. So, I bought this skin from Speck Products. Its is absolutely awesome! ---  --- No more dings or scratches. I'm a minimalist and for that, the Blackberry Skin is perfect! A cool look, not bulky. Easy access to the buttons. They did their homework on this product.  ---  --- A must have for anyone who owns a Blackberry. I also see they have these for the Treos
My daughter who is about to turn 4 loves this game.  She wants to play it constantly.  So it's good for their entertainment value but bad for yours. The dresses are hard to get on the dolls and they rip and tear very easily.  It takes as long to set the game up as it does to take it.  There are also some sketchy directions such as rolling the dice but not having to go as far as the die say but you can't go over that numbers i.e. you roll a 4 but you only want to go 3 spaces then that's allowed.  That's confusing when you're trying to teach your kids their numbers and how many spaces to go but otherwise you'd be rolling the dice forever trying to get to the one spot you're trying to reach
When I recieved this item, I had mixed emotions for the product. On one hand, the black finish looked very nice, and the clear plastic covering protected the screen but was still easy to read. Also, all of the side buttons are fairly easy to reach with average-sized fingers (except maybe the camera button), so navigating the phone with the cover still closed is pretty easy unless you need to use touch functions or open the QWERTY keyboard. --- However, due to the padding and the nature of the metal materials, the case is very thick and bulky - when using the belt clip, the phone sticks out far enough that it does not even rest evenly on your hip, but leans at an angle. ---  --- BUT, the deciding factor in my two-star rating is that this case was the cause of the only two times I have dropped my Cingular 8525 (which at such a steep price, is not something I like to drop). The problem lies with the snap-shut system that closes the case. Because the metal is so thin, it does not secure very well, and can come open pretty easily. To fix this, I simply bent the piece of metal downward and towards the phone, so that it was much harder to both open and close the case. This, for the most part, solves the problem, but it is still dangerous and caution is DEFINATELY in order. ---  --- My favorite thing about this case is that you can open the case and slide the keyboard open without actually taking the phone out of the case. This is nice because it enable quick replies to text messages. This is the only reason I did not give it a one-star rating.  ---  --- I am currently looking for a soft case, preferably a leather sleeve case that I can just pull my phone out of off of my hip, rather than bother with a clip anymore. ---  --- As a final warning - BE CAREFUL if you buy this case. Plus, I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point
This is a great desk top or night stand clock.  Projection to view time requires it to be dark, but it is great.  Projection requires the clock to be plugged in with the included adapter.  Batteries are used for backup and normal view. 
Try before you buy! This game has a major glitch: its save game files are erased sometimes, so you can start all over again. --- Beware
I have been very impressed with every Avent product that I have purchased.  I have found these pacifiers to be so nice.  They are completely clear and you are able to see smiles around them.  My baby LOVES hers.  We can't live without them
I love this book! I have read A-C so far, and this is my favorite book so far. It has a really strong plot, and a surprising ending. This crime book series is great, and I highly suggest picking this book up, or even starting with A
My daughter got this toy when she was 2 months old and she still loves it (at 8 months).  It was the only toy that would keep her entertained on car trips at first. ---  --- I took one star off due to some minor problems: 1) it is not machine washable (unless you don't mind loosing the barking sound) and 2) the battery can't be replaced.  
I know my gummi's and Haribo gummi's are the only ones worth eating! If I can't find this brand at the store, it's nothing. A little tip: I buy the 5lb. bag at Safeway for under $6! (A much better bargain than here.) They are usually located on the bottom shelf underneath the hanging smaller bags
Overall, I am satisfied.  So far I have not experienced creep, but I move my car into position very very slowly, so that may help. ---  --- My one suggestion is that it could be wider.  It is easy to slide by if I am just a little off line. ---  --- I have yet to try it on my boat trailer, so that will have to be covered later
I bought Version 5 of this software a few years ago and was very pleased with the many features.  A tech at my Isp (BellSouth) recommended this software to me. I recently purchased version 6 for my new laptop which is running Windows Xp Pro.  Installation was a snap.  Updates are frequent and install quickly with my Dsl connection.  The software suite has in my opinion more and better features than Norton Pro which I use on my desktop.  I really like the Registry cleaner (fixer) and the defrag tools.  (They use Trend Micro for virus protection) The program allows simple maintenance or for more experienced users indepth tools that allow you to maintain and tweak your system. There is a lot of extra programs that come with this software that I did not install after reading some reviews and warnings about using them.  However, my personal experience after installing just the System Suit 6 Professional has really been good for me. I bought my copy from Walmart and filled out the rebate following the instructions carefully and I received my rebate after about 6 weeks.  I hope if anyone buys this software because of my recommendation will have similar results.  I would rate my knowledge of computers as above average, which may be why I did not have any problems with the software.
This looked great when it came, but broke in only one day. REALLY poor craftmanship.
This is truly the best in highlighting products and I have tried many high end and cheaper products out there.  This is so light and just doesn't get all cakey and greasy.  I have tried so many brands that claim to look natural, but they just don't.  This really does and don't let the price fool you either.  It only takes alittle and lasts a long time, so well worth the price for the look it gives.  I love this!
I liked the watch. I had to send the first one back because the date would never change. I got the second one a month ago and haven't been able to wear it for the past two weeks because the band gave me a skin rash. Nice looking watch. Too bad I have to carry it around in my pocket now
My son (3) and I love these.  He likes to hop them around and kiss them before he eats them.  He likes all the Bunny Graham varieties (chocolate, honey, cinnamon); they taste like the traditional Graham crackers
The picture for this pendant is deceiving; it is a lot smaller than it appears.  I know the dimensions were given but the picture gives one the impression that it is bigger than it really is.  Nevertheless, my wife likes it very much and that's good enough for me.  The price was right at $18.00 so overall I think it was a good buy.
DO NOT PASS THIS ONE UP. BUY THIS AMAZING DVD AND YOUR EARS WILL BE SATISFIED..
I agree with some of the reviews about the rush and need to keep up with the happiness tied to immigrant status.  That being said - I spent endless hours researching and building and thoroughly enjoyed this game.  Well worth the cost and enjoyable.  I am not familiar with the other Civ games - and was looking more for a city building game set in the past, similar to my favorite game Children of the Nile - perhaps that explains why I was not disappointed
I bought the WMR968 2/10/2005 and as of today,2/14/2007, only the indoor Baro-Therm-hygro still works. The Anemometer was replaced under warrenty 11/2005. This service took 2 months to complete with Oregon Sci. The anemometer then quit 12/2006 and Oregon Sci. said tough luck it's out of warranty. The Thermo-Hygro quit 2/2007 and once again, tough luck. ---  ---  My thoughts on the unit besides it not functioning after 2 years: Cheap and cheaper. The manual is nearly worthless. The anemometer is accurate to about 60 Kts. then gets wildly optimistic. The temp.,humidity, baro seem accurate. The rain gauge is kinda funky the way it reports because of a delay built in and the resolution but it is useable. All of the failures I have had I think are related to water intrusion into the sending units. Everone has had green corrosion on the PC boards when taken down from the rooftop. The sealing of the units is very poor and the use of phone cords is very cheap.  ---  ---  I just got off the phone, again, with Oregon Sci. and Juan from customer Service told me "we can't help you".  ---  ---  If you want a weather station that is made cheaply, has no customer support and will last less then 2 years buy a WMR968. I guess for the price compared to professional weather stations this thing will attarct a lot of people but buyer beware
My trusty Seiko of 21 years gave out recently (I should really remember to take it off when doing strenuous labor) and I went in search of a similar style.  I received this replacement about a week ago and I love it already.  It's light-weight and easy to read in the light or dark
I looked at this camera the Panasonic hvx200, the sonys, the jvc 200, and even Canon's bigger brother the X1. I found this one to have fantastic reviews on DVinfo.net, a great video forum. My concerns about 24f vs 24p were addressed to my satisfaction- there really isn't a difference. I like tape vs the HVX's expensive storage solutions. One concern I had was, will it look like a pro camera? That is important in some situations where your equipment gives you added credibilty with clients and talent.  ---  --- As soon as I opened the box I was in love! This is a really substantial camera. Especially with the opt wide angle from Canon and the matte box provided, this does not look like your mama's camcorder. ---  --- I really like the manual controls, so that you don't have to go thru menus to change parameters. The layout of everything is great. I really like the dual on/off and zoom controls- top of handle plus rear right side. Holding the handle for low or medium height shots is very, very comfortable and the controls are perfectly positioned.  ---  --- Only down side- and it is incidental. The matte box is a bit flimsy- lightweight plastic. That helps with weight, but I worry about breaking it. Some may say that HDV codec is not as good as DVCpro, but my eye does not see it. The colors are magnificent and it blows away many other cams in low-light. ---  --- If you are looking for point and shoot, this is not your baby, but if you want a pro quality camera for a really great price- this is it
I wanted a bike to ride around on unpaved trails on my few acres in the country.  This retro designed, one speed, steel framed, coaster braked, comfort  bike seemed to be the ideal choice.  When it arrived, I pulled out the tool box and set to work assembling it.  The first frustration was that the instructions for assembling this bike are NOT included in the manual (which seems to cover every bike but this one). How hard could it be to write up instructions (with tool specifications)for EACH model they manufacture?  A one page flyer could have done the trick. To further complicate  matters, some of the models in the manual are assembled using metric tools and others call for standard sizes.   ---  --- It turned out that I couldn't complete the assembly, because I couldn't find a tool to handle the quick release hardware for the seat attachment.  I had to take the bike to a bike shop to complete the assembly.  Even the bike shop had problems with this bike, because there is so little clearance between the fenders and the tires.  I watched while they had to bend the sides of the back fender out by hand, so that it wouldn't rub the tire.   ---  --- When I got the bike home, the first thing that I did was to adjust the seat to the correct height, and take it out for a ride.  Within 10 seconds the seat slipped all the way down.  The quick release handle can't hold the seat in place with the weight of a rider on it (I'm not that heavy).  Chrysler should have taken the retro design a step farther on this, and drilled holes in the seat stem for a rod insert to adjust the seat height.   ---  --- Rather than try to dis- assemble this and box it up to return it...I will check to see if I can drill the seat stem myself to get the seat secured at a ridable height.  Its too bad they couldn't come up with a workable design for such an essential part of the bike as the seat height adjustment!  The points I do give here are for the otherwise sturdy frame, and tires that will work well for unpaved trails...when I can finally ride this. 
But just add a little Spenda and cream and it is mmm, mmm, good. I can actually feel a slight boost of energy and think more clearly on the days that I drink this tea. Also, I haven't had the slightest inkling of a cold or flu. This year has been an especially bad cold and flu season for this area and I have been exposed to all of it but, knock on wood, I've been the healthiest one in the family and at work (and the only one drinking this stuff). So go figure? There are too many things good about this tea to not try it
this is a very tasty brew, just right strength for your regular mug.  On the senseo just hit the two cup button and its just right
Don't bye thees. They don't look like orginals. They are really small, so it looks like glasses for children!! --- It's just waste of mone
I bought this for my wife for the holidays, it was a bit expensive for a candle but I believed that it would last a long time and burn uniformly. However, in our case, after about an hour the candle went out. The wick burned too quickly, becoming too small, and now the candle won't stay lit for more than a few minutes before it drowns in the wax. The return shipping will cost a lot, so we will just toss it out. Waste of money, don't buy one
This fanny pack is superb.  The design is very roomy: a very large main compartment fully lined and zippered, and two convenient smaller zippered compartments in the outside front of bag.  Also fairly large zippered area within the main compartment, and another on the back of the fanny pack leather area near your body.  As yet I haven't found a use for the very small side zippered pockets near the belt.  The leather is very good quality and the brown is a warm medium shade.  All zippers work well.  Extra large belt.  I am a new fanny pack wearer, so it does take some getting used to the  bulk and weight in the front waist area, but it beats the strain of shoulder straps, hand bags, etc.  I use the cell phone pocket for my hearing aid volume/program adjustment device, the size of a small cell phone. Similar fanny packs in leather stores in my town cost over $70 without all the features of this one.   It arrived soon after I ordered it. I recommend it highly.  You won't be disappointed. 
I would often rush to see all Arnold Schwarzenegger films, i adore his bad acting "it must be the muscles" i was 10 year old and he was the bomb now his movies now gives me a pain in my stomach and i start to twitch, i can't believe how terrible an actor this man was "IS"  and all the money he made doing these unrealistic bull crap, wow! talk about the American dream, i admit there are some of his movies i would have to rate a classic but however this one really sucks maybe it was the time,trend, maybe the era, but i have come a long way and this guy is a difinite no! no! for me, this movie had it's moments! for a 8 year old maybe! for an adult you have to have a strong stomach, you i would never say this about Bruce Willis mybe i am a hypocrite or maybe he just an good actor duh! i couldn't care less do with this what you will i won't recommend it later folks
I really like my earrings that I bought and they came in time
Ashley Judd's (Normal Life, The Locusts) husband, played by Jim Caviezel (The Passion Of The Christ, Frequency) gets arrested and put on the guilty bench for a slaughter in El Salvador a bunch of years ago. So, Judd hires the always superb Morgan Freeman (Unleashed, Million Dollar Baby) to help her out on the case and to find out the truth while she tries to get her husband out of imprisonment. Judd then has threats on her life after. The opening sequence pulls you in, the thrills are a mixed bag (car crash scene for example was good) and the outcome, well, I really saw coming anyway. Ashley Judd's thrid thriller but its her second one with a murderous manipulative husband(Double Jeopardy). Twisted and Kiss The Girls had a killer running after her or playing games with her noggin. Also starring Bruce Davison (X-Men, Dahmer), Amanda Peet (The Whole Nine Yards, The Whole Ten Yards) and Tom Bower (Die Hard 2
It starts out like Laura Bush's Rules for Driving, but skydives after the opening pages, in which the then 17-year-old Laura kills a young man with her car, who just coincidentally happens to be her boyfriend!   ---  --- My interest in the book sharply dove after that, as it appears that coincidental killing is the most appealing thing about Laura Bush
My boyfriend has this cologne and I love it!  It smells so good.  Even if he is wearing the deodorant and not the cologne, it smells as if he was.  It may be a little on the expensive side (not as expensive on amazon.com as Macy's or other department stores), but it's well worth it.  Just be sure to correctly select the item you want because the picture shown is of the cologne
Good Camera for the Money.. Picture quality excellent. Used camera on recent trio to Florida for Spring Training and colors superb.Still learning the fine points and capabilties of the product. Dealing through Amazon exceptional. Product arrived well within promised time frame. --- No doubt a Good Deal 
This puzzle is a lot of fun and my son loves it. The container is a toy for itself
These are hands down, the most awesome pillows, we have ever owned.  They were originally suggested by a chiropractor at $60 per pillow, however at the time, a "water bed pillow" for $60 just sounded silly.  What brought me back around to these pillows, was the year-long search that my wife and I had been on for the perfect pillows.  One of her beloved cats managed to destroy our previous and quite comfortable pillows, which subsequently caused us to get caught up in the frustrating search for the perfect pillow.  We spent a year, buying this pillow and that pillow, all to no avail.  Then one day I rolled the dice, and bought a pair of these pillows with the covers.  The covers actually make the dish.  These are the most comfortable pillows that I have ever slept on in my 42 years on this planet!!!  These pillows rate 10 stars!!!  Just follow the directions and enjoy the best nights sleep you have ever had.  I do not work for, nor own this company, although after using their product I wish I did!!!  Our pillows are about three months old so far, and holding up exceptionally well.  They recommend you change the water every six months or so, depending on what type of water you put in.  The pillow is about half to three quarters cushion, with the water being the bottom layer.  They seal tight and do not leak. There is no audible sound from the water in the pillow, as if you follow the directions, they will instruct you on how to expel excess air.  These pillows and of those Black & Decker scissors, have to be my two best finds for 2006!!
I've had this knife and their rainbow leak model for few years. All I wanted was a thin, small and light knife and I got it. The blade material is hard enough to stay sharp for a while, soft enough to easily sharpen but not brittle like a ceramic or carbon steel knife for example. I have had the vary tip break a couple times but it's because I was doing something foolish with it (like using it as a throwing knife *wink wink* ;) ). It's not the best, it's not the worst but can compete with ether, witch is the best in my opinion. Shortly after I bought it the speed safe spring broke, eehhh who cares it opens fine without. It's vary well made it can take all of my fat butts weight easily when laying sideways on a hard surface. It's vary thin profile is comfortable and I sometimes can't tell if I have it with me or not. It has what looks like brass or copper washers/bushings instead of cheap thin steel/plastic ones (means no binding up, even when in need of oil). The frame lock is far stronger than a line lock and best of all it deforms and wares much slower meaning my knife will stay ridged when opened for a long time. ---  --- My favorite thing about it is the fact you can position the clip henge up or down. I chose henge down so it's ready to open the second it comes out of my pocket. ---  --- If you want nice quality and availability for the price, kershaw is worth looking at
Rule number one if you're making a Stephen King movie, especially if it's a TV movie; make it scary or don't make it at all!  THE TOMMYKNOCKERS fails to do this miserably!  For most of the film, you're watching a lot of green light and a lot of silly inventions.  Granted, that's all in the book, but it written chillingly by King in a way only he can do it.  There are some exciting alien moments at the end, but by then it's too late.  You've just spent three hours watching a bad knock off of an X-FILES episode. ---  --- On the plus side, I had no problem watching the infamous Traci Lords act like like a total slut!  Bless her

Don`t waste your time and money on this compilation.  What a cheap shot to take the consumers money.  Read the very fine print, it does have a disclaimer but you really have to look for it.  Shame on the distributor!
This item came in the mail and my 4 year old son and I were very excited.  I guess we should have read the description more carefully because I wasn't expecting so many tiny little pieces.  We used ticky tack and began the tedious process of sticking the different sized stars and such all over his room.  We waited that night to see the glowing celestial extravaganza.  We kept the light on for some time to 'charge' the glow in the dark element then turned off the light.  What we found was nothing close to amazing.  The glow was fairly dim and only lasted for a very short period of time.  We even turned a blacklight on them and all that did was make them glow a little brighter but, again, the glow only lasted about 10 -15 minutes.  I ended up going back online and buying glow in the dark paint and a star shaped sponge.  We dabbed stars all over his ceiling.  These glowing stars last most of the night and our friends and family think his room is really cool
So many disbelievers out there! I feel so sorry for you: no magic left in your dull and predictable worlds? Of course this book is on the level. While my dog Ernestine does not build art pieces as such, she's a pretty good cook and a crack shot. So why not dog artists? The review of dog art is a little species-centric, however. Most of the dog artists I know use faecies or urine to construct art, or engage in performance pieces: "Rooting The Leg"; and "Licking The Balls" spring to mind. Dog culture can be appreciated by humans but is not the SAME as human cuture. So a little less chauvanism please Ms Mathison
These cherries are awesome, my whole family loves them. We lived in Germany for 3 years and to find a place state side to order these from is great we order alot of them beucase they sure go fast
I have had this phone for almost 2 years now. I have dropped it many times- still works.  In Dec 06 it went through the washing machine in my pants, I let it dry out for 1 day and guess what- IT WORKS.  I am still using it as it works perfectly - even the camera. ---  --- I used my sisters Razr phone this weekend and I hated it.  The redial feature was slow and the phone not comfortable.  I will be keeping my Samsung for as long as it lives
Ok It's so obviously obstructing the view of your license plate. I thought it would only blur it from the high distant angles of the cameras but it blurs it from almost every angle besides directly behind it (and even then the edges are blurry).  Check the laws in your local state. I'm pretty sure this thing is very illegal!!! I had to trash mine. Thanks for taking my money
We have had it on our patio for about 4 months and it works great, the numbers are clear enoungh to see from our pool area
One of the best bargains yet that we have purchased from Amazon
We needed a car top carrier for a drive from Arizona to Utah.  After much research, we decided to give the Kar Pak a try.  It worked wonderfully!  We fit two suitcases, a duffle bag, and some random stuff in garbage bags on top of our minivan.  During the drive, we weathered snow, sun, and rain.  We were on the road for a total of 13 hours.  By the time we reached our destination, everything inside the Kar Pak was dry and perfect. The Kar Pak itself was easily washed off, folded up in it's box, and put into storage.  This is a great option for someone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money on a car top carrier.  It's easy to install, doesn't budge (we checked the straps several times during the trip, they never loosened or anything), and it keeps everything inside dry if it rains or snows. 
First: The part that the ratcheting clip clips to has to be attached to the case with 4 screws.  Second:  No Fixed belt clip.  Third: Only the case is black, all other parts are clear plastic.  Bought 10 of them for 36 cents each, spent 35 dollars on shipping.  Guess i got what i paid for.  Now i have to go thru the process of trying to get a full refund
It's a cute little set - and I mean little.  Wayyyyy over-priced.  (...) Just didn't live up to expectations
At first glance, you'll think these are great - but the wimpy elastic combined with the slippery fabric makes for panties that are constantly sliding off your butt.
I love this sack.  And highly recommend it especially if your child likes to kick the blankets up over their heads.  Before I purchased this I found her sleeping with the coveres over her head twice!!!
I bought a pair of these, my wife tried them and liked them so much that she asked me to get a pair for her for Valentines Day (chocolates and flowers don't do it for her).  These headphones sound as good as my Bose for a fraction of the cost but give up a little in comfort (they do fit better with more use).  Do they really need that thick of a cord?
  I bought this dock from a seller called Miga.  They did an excellent job of answering my questions on the product and sending everything in mint condition.  I use the dock for my HP R817.  Having read the reviews regarding the insert I just went through HP's part site and ordered the correct insert for my camera.  It was only $5 (before shipping) and it arrived the same day as the dock package.  The dock transfers data so much faster then the cradle that comes with the camera plus it has an extra battery which would cost $50 and up by itself from HP.  I bought the dock for its dual charging ability for when I go on trips since this dock is less expensive then the fast charge travel kit.  I probably won't use the remote control feature or print images right from the dock.  But for what I will use it for its an excellent product for the price and I highly recommend it for you 817 818 users out there. 
He loves the Dog. I has very happy to find him. Since Toy Story was out 10 years ago I did not thing i would ever find  Slink my Grandsons favorite
I have rated this a 1 star because I have yet to receive the product that I ordered in November.                       ---  ---                                  B.R. from St Louis ---  ---                                         ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---                     
We are teaching my 6YO to ride a bike, but it's not going well.  He wanted a scooter, so I got him the Razor A2 and ordered the Razor Pro for me.  Very nice!  Supports my weight, is easy to maneuver, and is inexpensive!  The only problem is folding it up again when we're done - this is sometimes a bit tricky
The lotion does not get very warm and only the lotion in the uppermost part of the dispenser gets warm.  So if you want to use a lot of lotion, you have to wait in between while the lotion warms up.  I have dry skin so I put lotion all over.  Its more of an inconvenience to have to wait for each application to warm up and even when it does warm up, it isn't super warm. 
I bought this Barbie after seeing two pictures of angel Barbies on the website and reading the Manufacturer's Description. One picture seems to have been deleted now. The Manufacturer's description is of an angel with a dark blue dress and a long gold sash. I trusted that the Manufacturer's description, which matched one of the pictures, was the correct angel. The doll with the light blue dress is not impressive at all. It is very simple with vinyl wings. Be aware of which you are purchasing, the description is deceptive and incorrect
I use this for hand-tossed pizzas and it works quite well. It takes about 11 minutes to cook in a grill that has been pre-heated about 15 minutes. The pizza cooks evenly and the crust is perfectly done. My only gripe is that I wish you could get a bigger pan so that one could cook a larger (14-17") pizza.
These are the best memory cards you can get for the PS2.  Only get this one or the Sony PlayStation 2 1PK Memory Card.  Rumors spread that non-Sony memory cards can damage your PS2 and lose saves on you memory cards
I cannot believe they put this on the market.  Once it gets wet, there isn't much you can do about wringing it out.  It's title is true - it is a water magnet.  The problem is it just won't let the water go.  This towel is horrible.  I suggest using the 3-pack microfiber Meguiar's towels sold by Amazon as well under the subject "Meguiar's X2020 Supreme Shine Microfiber - Pack of 3"
I found this product to represent extremely poor value for money.  I purchased the product based on all the marketing hype and testimonials.  However, I have since come to the conclusion that these guys must pay people to write positive testimonials. ---  --- This product only covers the basics (levels 1 & 2).  Then they try to rope you into paying even more money for their intermediate levels. ---  --- I have since purchased a cheaper 'Tell Me More' package (for Spanish) and have been highly impressed with the scope of it.  They have packed so much more value into their package.  And it is a complete package - all the way to advanced level. ---  --- I think it's really disgusting that Rosetta Stone get away with selling such a seriously inferior product at such a highly inflated price and people still buy it.  I think it borders on being a scam
I LOVE these cups and better yet so does my baby!  They are easy for her to hold and the soft tip makes it easy for her to drink.  She has no idea that it's not a bottle.  It has made the transition away from the bottle so much easier.  Thank you
I bought this battery as a replacement for an old Canon BP511A.  It lasted about a couple of months before it started not taking a charge.  Complete waste of money
Lame! Lame! Lame! Corny sexual humour. No wonder it tanked- if the Amazon.com thing is true. Because it's bad. Don't watch it unless you think e*ections are one of the funniest things in the whole entire world
I could not get this mirror to angle properly in our Honda CR-V to give a view of the baby, and when my wife held the mirror on the seat as a test, the image of the baby was so small that I could discern no details about what the baby was doing. The mirror is also distorting. The image only appears focused and in the appropriate dimensions if you look DIRECTLY into the center of the mirror.
I've never been a big fan of dried fruit -- good for you or not, they are just too sweet for me.  But these montmorency cherries are wonderful.  It's the right mix of sweetness with tartness.  I LOVE to eat these straight out of the bag. 
I was a little reluctant to purchase these because I had heard a lot of things about the spring mechanism in them being faulty but that they were being recalled and fixed.  So I was wondering if the one I bought was a fixed model or not.  Well, it must have the newer design because I've been using these for a few months and I have nothing but good things to say about them.  I was previously using a long OXO set of tongs which were pretty good but a little flimsy for some of the heftier cuts of meat like, whole chickens and pork shoulders.  These tongs are sturdy!  You know that the minute you pick them up and feel the weight to them.  They can easily pick up anything you need on the grill and, because of the 20 inch length, you can keep you hand at a safe distance from the actual fire.  The handle has grooves for your fingers and thumbs which enhances the grip and they lock in a closed position for storage. --- If you do any outdoor cooking, you will appreciate these tongs.  They're a well thought out piece of equipment you'll use for years and be glad you purchased
55cm is for people as tall as 5ft-5". So this works great for my wife but not for me. She is pregnant and so safety was my number one criteria for selecting this. This is an amazing anti-burst ball.
I have mixed feelings about Philosophy products.  For one thing they have really done a number on my skin as far as drying certain areas of my skin out.  On the other hand, I use to have a very congested skin and nose area but I have noticed a HUGE difference in the congestion of my skin when using When Hope is NOt enough serum.  I haven't noticed any lifting but the line between my eyebrows has softened.  As far as reducing facial hair growth don't count on it.  I am only giving this 4 stars because even though it has helped keep my congestion under control, it hasn't done much more than that and I think it is a bit pricy for being just an exfoliator
Contrary to what the box and description here says this disc has NO subtitles or closed captions or whatever. The R2 neither. ---  --- So again, don't feel sorry for the film companies about their complaining of copying of films and stuff. ---  --- Non anamorphic or simply 4:3 format, no subs, not available at all (yes I mean you, Disney)... In short, no quality or consistency. Go and take a hike. ---  --- Stop lobbying for legislation and start making real DVD's
Its  just realy sad that hip-hop dont sound like  hard to earn anymore... Gang starr still gets daily airplay on my stereo and im glad i support these guys
We Love it! Best purchase I have made in a long time! At first I thought it was a little too much to spend on a metal detector...  This is in the middle range and very easy to use. I bought it as a family project, something we all could do. In the first 3 months of purchasing it we have found 3 diamond rings, 2 gold watches, a bracelet, gold necklace and several old and valuable coins that date back to as early as 1890. Also it's a great hobbie and money maker. Worth every cent!! Don't forget to get the headphones---a MUST!!! Get it for a Christmas 2004 gift, your gift will keep them busy and keep giving back all year long
I was assigned this book for a college course and was greatly surprised at its quality.  Blamires had C.S. Lewis as a tutor, and I've read some of Lewis's writings and have found them to be above average but not particularly special (many people do find his works special of course).  Blamires, on the other hand, I find to be very unique - his book is top quality and very helpful.  I'm surprised this isn't a very popular book, as it ought to be. ---  --- I have only two complaints, both of which are purely stylistic.  First, the edition I have looks like it's a copy of an earlier edition, which makes the text hard to read (I got used to it after a while though).  Some publisher should take it upon themself to retype this book and republish it.  My second criticism is something that can't be avoided - the book was originally written in the early sixties, so a lot of the examples are dated (i.e. references to WWII, which was still in memory, also out-of-date terms like "jive", etc.).  However, just a few of the examples are affected by this.  The book as a whole could be reasonably passed off today as a recent work, since so much Blamires's criticism of the Christian mind (or lack thereof) still (sadly) applies. ---  --- However, the Christian mind today is being rediscovered, and the march of atheism is on the decline, with the march of religion in general on the rise.  Even though things are looking up, Christians should keep Blamires's book in mind - not to get too comfortable with this (secular) world, for our real home is beyond bodily death.  That we ought to have a supernatural orientation is basically the theme and summary of this book. ---  --- Superb book, and I really recommend this to anyone.  This is definitely recommended for Christians, and also for any non-Christian who are curious and want to take a look at some of the problems Christians have today
Hey, angry young man! If you're going to just sit there all smug, Mr. "Yeah, I used to have a TV, but I busted it cuz I just don't care, doggie," and make fun of this nation's fine Secret Service, why don't you just go to an axis of evil nation and see how funny it is then? When you're sucking on rocks to stave off the inevitable side effects of dehydration. When, if you want to go to the market to buy more rocks to suck on, you have to whip yourself with metal shards tied to the end of long leather straps as you walk. And just because you saved the sorry excuse for a young lady who will become a drug addict bag lady once she gets old enough to lose hope of realizing her dreams earns you no points in my book. Freedom doesn't come for free, so quit whining about the draft, Dick Trickle! The "Moonlighting" tie-in is cute, but quickly turns sour, as Bruce Willis seems to have been off working on another "Die Hard" installment while the episode was being filmed and it's just not the same without those sarcastic wing-dingers. Bet you didn't know Lou Ferrigno was Scorsese's first choice for the lead, but he wasn't willing to thin down for the role and he kept firing his language coaches
Our son wanted a drum set for his 15th birthday.  Seeings he is totally new to this we didn't want to pay a huge sum for a set only to have him lose interest.  This set is great for beginners and he's very happy with it. ---  --- To people considering purchasing this, please note that the cymbals ARE NOT included with this set even though they are in the picture.  Perhaps the company should consider posting another photos sans the cymbals
I used Veganese for quite awhile, quite happily.  As there is no artificial fragrance, or strong natural fragrance oils in the product, it has a ho-hum scent.  This actaully was a nice break from all the overwhelmingly perfumed hair products on the market.  I felt Veganese adequately conditioned my hair, did not irritate my scalp.  I liked that it had no animal products and is not tested on animals.  Those who try to avoid chemicals may not like sodium lauryl sulfate in this product
I've lived in Oregon, Colorado and now the Northeast, and seen my fair share of snow. I got one of these from a friend two winters ago, and it's the best tool for snow removal I've used. I still have my ice scraper, since this won't remove ice, but it did wonders for those overnight dumps of 18-24 inches that we got in the northeast last year. I'm buying one for some Florida friends who will be experiencing winter for the first time in the northeast this year
i was so happy to recieve this movie,its very rarely shown on tv,i own my own thanks to amazon. the music in this movie is magnificent it's something to treasure for a life time .glen miller was a great composer ,one of my favorites is moonlight serenade ,they just cant make music like this any more ,this is a great movie to add to your collection. thank you amazo
I have tried many brands of chocolate covered toffee and I have to say Virgina Diner English Chocolate Covered Toffee is one of the best!  It is very fresh and it melts in your mouth. 
I must agree with the comments made by other reviewers.  This album is great.  Nancy Wilson's voice on this album is unlike anything I have ever heard.  You can't honestly say you're a fan of jazz if you don't own this
....and secured their musical legacy.  The Real Thing was a solid rock/rap mixture with newly hired Mike Patton providing vocals.  On Angel Dust, Patton had a lot more creative input, providing his wonderful vocal stylings and schizophrenic persona to Faith No More.  It's a joyous ride that after a less than stellar performance initially, has become something of a cult classic and favorite among many newer acts - and with good reason.  This album is all over the board.  Land of Sunshine reads like a list of fortune cookies (which is the supposed inspiration), while Caffeine is an anthem for Patton's drug of choice, and one of FNM's most energetic recordings.  Then there is the occaisonal oddball track showing Patton's range and sense of fun, like RV, which is like a melancholic rant from the stereotypical figure you might find living in an RV.  Not exactly bilboard material, but fun. ---  --- Adding to the record were the internal tensions of the band.  Jim Martin was having creative differences, yet pumps out some of his best work here.  Tensions may have fueld a more agressive record, and FNM would never sound better than they do on this album.  It's the bands chemistry - both good and bad - that make this album work.  Commercially, this might have not been the hit the record company wanted, but its legacy can still be heard today and it's still a great record to crank up for a drive, barely showing its 15 year old age
These shoes are beautiful and comfortable.  I wore them at a New Year's Eve wedding... danced all night with NO sore feet!  This is my third pair of Carlos shoes, LOVE THEM
WHITE RABBIT is one of the most famous brands of Guan Sheng Yuan (Group) Co.,ltd.and belongs to candy product. This product is very larruping that the candy's surface swathe a very very thin velamen made from sticky rice and it can eat.People always are interesting in the sticky rice velamen.This product's sales volume is very hot in USA(Kmart,Walgmart)
These earrings are great. They are the perfect size. I would recommend these to anyone who likes a classic look.
I'm a cologne junkie, and of my vast collection, Armani Mania is clearly my #1.  I'm into my 3rd bottle of this potion, and it continues to bring on the compliments, and inquiries of "What's that cologne you're wearing, it smells fantastic!"  You cannot - repeat - CANNOT go wrong here.  A modern classic
this is a great wallet! it fits into small purses. the purpose of this is just to hold a few cards, your id and a small zipper section for some money. it's not meant to be a complete, big wallet. i love it because it fits into my small purses and so easy to carry around. i don't have to shove and push my bigger wallets into my purse and not have room for anything else anymore. love it!
I just bought this yesterday, and though the product description here on Amazon says it's compatible with Windows 98 and Windows ME, the packaging says "TaxCut USB Drive is compatible with Windows 2000 and Windows XP."  All our taxes for several years have been done on a Windows ME computer with a USB port.  Now what?  HELP!
I was expecting the nero 6 ultimate all in one instead I received nero OEM Suite. The MPEG 4 encoder they claim is not included instead there is a thirty day trial. Better business bureau should be notified
I got so many compliments on these shoes the first time I wore them to work. They are very pretty and preppy looking. I wore them with slacks and a matching cable knit sweater. The green is very bright, so they don't match everything, but it's a standout accessory. Wore them without socks and had no blisters
IMPOSSIBLE TO RATE PRODUCT AS AMAZON SHIPPED BRAKE CLEANER INSTEAD OF POLISH. RETURN OF INEXPENSIVE ITEMS NOT WORTH THE TIME IT TAKES.  CONSIDER NOT USING AMAZON FOR SMALL PURCHASES UNTIL RETURN SYSTEM IS UPGRADED
its cute but it blocks barely any light. lace strap is itchy and uncomfortable.
I bought these because I normally can't wear a shoe without my orthodic insert. These are great. Very comfortable. I plan on living in them this summer. --- I bought a size 8 croc which was fine. These were on the big size so I exchanged them for the next smaller size. I guess I am a 7 and 1/2 so if you are inbetween sizes, go smaller with the Athens Croc
This was not exactly what I was expecting.  I thought it would be more like what I call "Vietnamese Sesame Balls."  Yet they were pretty good despite my mistake. --- 
Ordering online and not being able to try on clothing can be risky but it paid off with this purchase. I just wish it wasn't "hand wash only".
This is an adorable guitar and it's the perfect size for my two year old  but it's made cheaply.  The strings loosen after he strums it for a couple of  minutes which means I'm retightening the strings each time he plays with it. I  guess you get what you pay for (afterall, it  was only $14.99)! 
Quick shipping - I received this bike in 4 days (using free super saver shipping) and it was even over a holiday!  The bike comes in one large box with MANY pieces.  My husband and father put the bike together in less than 1 hour.  It looked a little overwhelming at first but was quite easy to assemble.  The bike is very compact and easily placed in small areas.  It is also very quiet - you have to listen closely to even hear the bike. ---  --- The resistance goes from 1 to 8 (one being the easiest to eight being the hardest).  My husband is an avid road biker and 8 could be too easy for someone looking for a really hard ride (like riding the equivalent of up-hill). ---  --- The bike offers basic functions that are displayed very large.  The display is easily toggled through.  The heart rate monitor picks up okay, but don't buy the bike based off of that function because it's not totally reliable. ---  --- All in all, a great buy!  I injured my back and was looking for a workout that would be good on my back.  The seat is uncomfortable (and I am petite- I would imagine it would be very uncomfortable if someone was larger.  But for the price, you can't beat it
I bought this tea because my job was stressing me out and causing a lot of anxiety, indigestion, etc. and I use and love the other flavors of Yogi tea.  Unfortunately, I can't handle the taste of this one.  It's just too strong - almost burns your tongue because it is so spicy.  I normally like ginger but this is too much
An ex-officer in the Argentinean military confesses how political prisoners were murdered. I can't write "highly recommended" about this book, because it seems to trivialise those horrible events to some marchendising event. Just read it, you may not be able to sleep for few nights, but you'll get a true look into the mirror of evil regimes, supported by the United States only because they were "anti-communist"
I bought this audio CD set at the Borders store, without the opportunity to preview the narration. Had I been able to do so, I probably never would have purchased it, let alone paid full bookstore price for it. But I needed an audiobook for my long drive the next day, so I relented.  ---  --- Lesson learned. ---  --- The audio quality is very insonsistent, at at times very poor, having been transcribed from the original audiotape recording.  ---  --- While the author is obviously greatly informed on the historical and geopolitical details of the Middle East, it does read very much like a history text. With the amount of detail presented, and the wide scope of coverage from one end of Europe reaching into the former Soviet states and beyond, one immediately feels the need for visual aids (maps, timelines, etc.) as guidance.  ---  --- The reader's narration is monotononous, with a very constant cadence which dulls the senses. Each sentence sounds the same as the last. This has the unfortunate effect of rendering each piece of information presented as no more significant than any other, and so all of the events seem to be lost to obscurity. After a while, the narration becomes little more than background noise. No information is retained by the listener
Wow! This is an excellent deck that lets you automatically get the Harpie Lady Cards, and as well as a monster card based on one of the characters from Legend Of The Mystical Ninja
Easy to use.  My car frequently has the CEL for engine misfires.  I took it to the dealer and they said as long as it's running OK, don't worry about it.  Now when it happens, I can clear the light myself, for free
I was expecting just to save the touch-screen from scratches, but these screens make the touch-screen also "feel" better. ---  --- There was no loss of brightness with the screen. ---  --- Placing the screen was a bit tough since clearning the surface perfectly is very tough. ---  --- Its a pack of 15 screens.  Have been using just the first one for the past three months, and see no need to replace it at least for another three months if at all I'll need to replace it
I am proud of the fact that I hold two degrees like many women. Do I work? No. I have chosen a different path. I have no children, married later in life, and gave up a wonderful job of two decades to care for my ill husband. Do I feel that I have no confidence nor respect? No. --- And from whom or what is this respect supposed to come from?   --- Caring for your family has nothing to do with any of this. I admire women who stay home to care for their families. When you have love, who gives a hoot what anyone else thinks. Personally, I find this book a little depressing, and I won't read it
I wanted to convert an HP LaserJet 4 Plus to a networked printer. Even though instructions from the manual was followed, the printer did not work. The customer support is claimed to be 24/7, but no one has closed my help desk ticket yet. This product cost more than a linksys router. So customers can naturally expect better customer service and better response time
We are always thrilled with the quality of Stella D'Oro cookies. They do indeed deserve the "gold star." These are shortcake cookies, very rich, with a fudge center. They are quite sweet and great for a tea table or served with a cup of strong espresso. This is the kind of cookie to pull out for top-notch guests and for dainty occasions like neighbors over for coffee, tea parties and after dinner sweets
My 14 month old son loves the Baby Einstein series.  They've been the only movies to hold his attention.  The sounds and music get his attention, the shapes and colors hold it. ---  --- That said, this movie never got or held his attention.  There are no interesting sounds or music.  The voices are very monotone.  While I understand the intention of this video, if you don't catch the attention of the child, what's the worth in it?  The pictures on the screen do not corrolate well with what is being said.  I also believe that there is value in learning not only foreign languages, but foreign cultures.  If I knew what was being said when nursery rhymes or poems are recited, I could repeat them in english as an additional learning tool.  All around, this move was disappointing
THE BEST BINOCULARS I HAVE OWNED,AND I HAVE HAD MANY. EXCELLENT CLARITY,GREAT FIELD OF VIEW TOO. NICE SIZE ALSO NOT TO BIG, NOT TO SMALL. YOU CANT GO WRONG WITH THIS FINE SET,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
 --- You can tell a lot about the readership a men's magazine is trying to reach by scanning the first three car ads. In the issue in front of me, they flog the Lincoln MKZ, Range Rover Sport, and Audi A6. ---  --- There you have it. We're going for the affluent but not super-rich young guy who won't even become aware that the Lincoln Town Car and Audi A8 exist until he turns 55.  Well, 52 maybe. ---  --- But you didn't need the cars to figure out MEN'S HEALTH. ---  --- It's about what all men think about and what affluent guys with six-pack abs (in reality or in their dreams) can generally snag: expensive suits, beautiful women who seem never not to pout, and beefy arms to set off those abs. ---  --- To be fair, there is actually a fair amount of *health* under discussion in these pages. But I doubt that's the main reason guys pull this magazine off the shelf instead of, say, DOG FANCIERS. ---  --- In spite of an irritating habit of treating women as trophies to be won or dupes to be lured, there is a good bit of wit in here about what one might call the manly dilemma in the modern world. And if it really is lack of *just* the right workout regimen that has kept you from getting all that's on offer in MEN'S WORLD, where there's at least one new workout each month that will cure all that ails you. ---  --- Don't mistake this monthly for serious journalism. But you won't need a brown paper bag to carry it out of the store either. ---  --- I kind of like it
I am so happy to have found this coffee.  --- This dark roast is rich in flavor. --- A great cup of coffee brightens my day every day
This is one of the nicest electric shavers that I've owned and the first wet-type shaver. I have previously owned Norelcos for over a decade. The original Norelcos (made in Holland) were fine but the recent ones have pathetic quality and they literally pull hair! It is painful! I eventually gave up trying to use my replacement lift-and-cut Norelco and decided to try out a high end model that cost close to two hundred dollars. Bad idea - you don't always get what you pay for! I was not quite happy with that either and after a two year haitus with disposable Gillettes, decided to try a wet shaver. I took my chance on this one, based solely on the reviews here. This is the very first "wet" shaver I've used and absolutely love it. It gives a close enough shave but not too close. You can use it with whatever shaving cream you use.  ---  --- Note that the Panasonic manual encourages using the cheapest foam type (not gel), Barbasol like stuff with this shaver. It also comes with a basic carrying pouch and the cleaning is as easy as it can get (just wash the thing under tap water). They really meant that this unit is washable. It is recharagable, lasts seven days on a charge, and costs less than replacement blades for competing brands. The build quality is excellent. The charger is a very clever design that gets the shaver completely off your counter space. You cannot go wrong with this. Amazon has a great value here. Sometimes you get more than you asked for and this is one of those rare things. Highly recommended. 
Would love to order these, but sizes are not clear.  Does small fit a toddler, is small a size 7?  Not sure how to order.
Very nice Gunpowder Green Tea.  Gunpowder Green is fairly dark when brewed and has a robust flavor.  My favorite of the green teas.  Timothy's is quite flavorful and works well in the keurig
This product is an absolute piece of junk. Do not buy this product. Will not even load properly onto computer. Have wasted several hours trying to install product on windows XP platform with no success. I have wasted a whole day trying to install this piece of junk on my computer, now I will probably waste another day trying to return this bunch of garbage to the vendor.
I had this camera for 2 months. It was kept in a case and was very well taken care of. I would not even allow my husband to touch it. I was taking pictures and then one suddenly came out as a white screen. I took another and the same thing. I asked my husband what he thought was wrong. We took out our memory card and tried internal. Same thing again. He said maybe it was the LCD screen. We loaded the pictures in the computer and it was even worse. I contacted Kodak several times. They don't care about their customers. I have talked to several others in similar situations with similar results. We will try to get their attention with a lawsuit. If interested contact me [...
While I realize that the majority of people thought this to be a stellar book, it reminds me of the story, "The Emperor has no clothes".  Yes, Choan can write a beautiful sentence and yes, the first several pages were intriguing but the switching of years was very annoying.  The "flipping back and forth" was not accomplished in a smooth, flowing manner.  In addition, the subject matter was incredibly depressing and the characters were so flawed that one did not even care about how their lives evolved.  The kidnapping was predictable and the ending contrived.  It would be impossible to recommend this book to anyone
I got my DVD a few weeks back and discovered I could not read any of the files form the 1990s. I tried on several computers I have in the house and came to realize that the DVD is defective. I contacted Gitcorp about the problem and they informed me they would send me a replacement disc.  ---  --- Problem is that after nearly four weeks there hasn't been any DVD and repeated attempts to contact Gitcorp has resulted in no reponses. ---  --- Update, after continued emails to Gitcorp, I finally got a replacment DVD. They didn't even ask to see the original bad DVD. So my rating of this product would go up if I could. If you buy the product, check it closely, and get in touch with Gitcorp as soon as you find any problems. They can be very slow about responding
Great magazine couldn't recommend it any higher for anyone starting out with macs. iCreate also introduced a great Pro section in 2005 to delveinto the workings of ProApps such as Final Cut Pro, Photoshop, mDVD Studio Pro etc. Now here's the thing, I'm wondering how the magazine can be available for subscription while the magazine was put on hold late last year. Me, or anyone I know with a subscription haven't recieved the mag for months, and there has been no contact from the people who handle the  subscription despite zillions of e-mails. So be careful, get the full story before you hand over any money!!!!!!!!!!!  check the web for similar storries, you will find the
The shoes are not exactly what I wanted bacause I was trying to get the same shoe that I had purchased some years ago. Times change and so does style. I searched everywhere and these were the closest to what I wanted. The Keds shoes from Amazon which I ordered and received on time might I add, were more like what we used to call Bo Bos and the rhyme used to go like this..... "Bo Bos they make your feet feel fine, Bo Bos they cost a dollar 99, Bo Bos." Don't know who made it up even but that was the rhyme we used to sing. I can't explain exactly how the older pair is but there is a slight look and feel of a difference. I still like the older ones better. Not sure if I'll ever find the same ones again. Oh and one last thing, if I could give shoe and clothing stores one tip, it would be to make adult sizes for the children's items. They make some really cool things for kids today. Like the Keds Girls' Jazzy Sneaker. Hope it's not just because I haven't grown up yet
A great shoe! I was very impressed with the softeness of the leather, immediate comfort and versatility of this shoe. This is definitely a well made, year 'round slide. If you are looking for a classic loafer; this is your shoe.
Two main problems with this "cordless massager". The first being that it doesn't hold a charge for very long. You may get an hour use on a full charge, and that shows diminishing power as it goes. Add to that it's general lack of any real massaging capability and you have one very poor piece of equipment. If you're looking for something to rumble a slight bit, this is for you. Otherwise, save your money
I don't have a review, I have a question.  As a grandparent of a 10 year old blind girl.  Is it possible that someone could send me directions for  this game?  I would like to get it printed in braille for her.  Thanks for  your help..Judi Ree
I love Peterson's Guides, but the birds of Mexico is severely lacking.  The art certainly holds up to the standard set by the guides to North America, but unfortunately, it can only be considered complete if you tag along two other Peterson Guides.  Perhaps a good addition if you wish to complete your collection of Peterson Guides, but otherwise, buy Howell's or Edward's Guides, both of which far outshine this guide when considered alone.  Howell's is certainly the most complete, but Edward's guide is a bit handier in the field
This is the type of story that scares me: where seemingly innocuous decisions propel characters toward a devastating fate.  The characters, portrayed by Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale, are going to be friends for life even if they slowly, eventually drift apart.  For a final trip together they decide not to go the safe, routine route of going to Hawaii, again, and want something different, perhaps a little adventurous, so they decide on Thailand.  While there they meet a charismatic, only slightly mysterious man on their trip and are both immediately enamored with him; and the jealousy starts to seep in.  In the midst of this subtle, female power struggle they are both conned and subsequently accused of smuggling narcotics and sent to jail. One poor decision after another and they are spinning helplessly down the drain.  It's always the more realistic tales of decent people caught up and tossed about by circumstance that are more frightening to me than the Hollywood horror-fests with aliens and gore.  There are many intense scenes throughout this film that had me caring about the principle actors and how were they ever going to get out of this horrible and unfair situation.  Claire Danes deserves top billing as she plays an average girl trapped in an unthinkable scenario, whereas everyone watching can relate to her emotional state at any given time.  She is truly a talent.  Kate Beckinsale nearly reaches the same level of intensity playing the all-American daddy's girl caught up in the chaos.  For that matter, when the two leads are playing off one another the chemistry is equally excellent.  Bill Pullman makes his presence felt with a conscience-stricken, kind-hearted turn as their lawyer.  There are even a handful of supporting characters that are memorable which makes this a veritable feast of character actors.  This is a movie worth watching over and again, and it is easy to recommend
this is the 2nd SE phone after T637, and this phone is just better --- using it with T-Mobile, it works pretty well as phone and modem --- voice: the strongest part, the best sounding phone I ever used in 6 years, the speakerphone is OK, not so loud --- reception: another strongest part, with T-Mobile, it can get some weak signal when all other don't get signal at all; however, the antenna is located at the top back (where the loop is), touching this part will lose reception --- operation: typical SE style, pretty easy for SE users, 3 dedicated buttons: web, messaging, task --- cam: excellent, even though it doesn't have auto-focus like K750 and K790, it looks pretty good, even it's better than nokia 6270 --- bt: very easy to use and pair, with pc suite installed, file transfer and sync is just a piece of cake, the transfer speed is 300-400kB, this is the maximum of bt 2.0 speed --- screen: the main screen is pretty bright, even I have to set the brightness down, animated standby screen is simply cool; external screen, however, is monochrome (it maybe a plus when using outdoors, the main is barely viewable under sunlight), it display info only, it's a kinda inconveient when doing self-pic --- audio player: I seldom use it because it doesn't support ogg vorbis, which I mainly use, streaming audio supports real only, no shoutcast --- conclusion: this phone is a pretty good phone for the price, quad-band is a must for Cingular users, fast EDGE modem for web and tethering --- score: I give it 95/100, there're some cons --- rare memory card (M2), and it's not hot-pluggable --- lack of ogg vorbis and shoutcast support --- no default USB mode (always asks when plug in, kinda annoying
I showed this to my 6th grade English class, while we were reading Miracle Worker to give them a glimpse into contemporary deaf culture. They loved it, and really learned a lot about cochlear implants. I highly recommend it for teachers who are interested in giving students a broaded understanding of deaf culture and also something that will really spark classroom debate and interest
I have always used Norton products, and upgraded to IS 2007 when my --- subscription came up for renewal. WHAT A MISTAKE. My computer --- freezes up all the time, and the software is difficult to use- it is --- not at all straightforward like previous versions of Internet Security. --- Do not buy this product.
 This was exactly what my husband had admired in Macy's.  I paid $25 more for the convenience of having it delivered to my home without my husband's knowledge.  He is thrilled with the jacket
My son love these shoes, I have to stop him from wearing them so much, I just wish they came in other colour
My son is [...] and aside from getting too big for his crib, my sister is having a baby and needs it. I was a bit concerned about making the transition for my son due to his "crib attachment," but this bed made it easy as pie. It's adorable, sturdy and fun. My little boy slept all night in his big boy bed from the very first night and we've never had a problem (we've had it for a month). He loves to drive his match box cars up and down the tracks and stand on the toy box saying "choo choo." It's just been great....I'm so glad we spent the money
 I needed a sub for my garage, and did not want to spend more than $200. Got it on sale for well under that. ---  ---  Since this was just for the garage, when tinkering with my bikes, I didn't want something too expensive, and didn't expect much from such a small sub. I was very pleasantly suprised by it's performance, This thing will rock when needed, and hits suprisingly low for a small sub in a very large space.  ---  ---  I first tried a Polk PSW10, since Polk products had never dissapointed me in the past. Well there is always a first time... The Yamaha smokes the Polk sub, I returned the Polk immediatly.  ---  ---  Of couse it doesn't compare with the Energy S12.3 I use in my main music system, but for 1/5 the cost, I never expected it to
Steven Seagal keeps making films. In 2005 alone, he made as many as four films, which itself sounds an amazing feat. Not so amazing, however, if you see `Today You Die' dreadful film with a dreadful title. The press material I managed to get at Japanese theater in Osaka (yes, they dared to release it theatrically in Japan) tells you that the film was shot in only 18 days. Small wonder that none of the film makes sense, gives less actions than awful dialogues. ---  --- Steven Seagal plays one Harlan Banks, ex-master thief who is retiring from his job. Banks turns a professional driver of cash delivery van in Las Vegas, but because of the robbery committed by someone else, he is arrested and sent to a jail. Is he framed? Of course, he is, but when he can wear his trademark long jacket in jail, and meets and enlists a help from someone named Ice Kool there (played by Treach), there is nothing to worry about.  ---  --- But I had to worry about because nothing makes sense in the film. We see a glimpse of one orphanage (briefly twice), but no one in the film seems to remember it. The film begins with a cheesy nightmare sequence that the girlfriend of Harlan sees (played by Mari Morrow) in her dream that portends death and danger, but this supernatural idea is just dropped in the second half of the film. There is a detective played by Sarah Buxton, whose motive to get close to Banks remains unclear, and Nick Mancuso adds confusion to the already chaotic scenario as Agent Saunders. ---  --- [DULL, DULL, DULL] The most impressive part of `Today You Die' is one car chase scene in Las Vegas with decent stunts and some nice camerawork. In fact, these scenes are recycled footages from one Sidney J. Furie actioner `Top Of the World' starring Peter Weller and Dennis Hopper (yes, I checked it yesterday). The rest of `Today You Die' consists mainly of terribly witless dialogues exchanged between Seagal's character and others, which goes like:  ---  --- BODYGUARD: "Who are you?!" --- SEAGAL: `Girl scout of America.'  ---  --- Naturally poor bodyguard is beaten up by Seagal clad in ridiculously long jacket, who does it with the minimum energy helped by lightening-speed editing and body doubles, which strongly suggest he is not willing to do the actions once he had shown in the films like `Above the Law.' ---  --- The film is strictly for the avid fans of Seagal, but I am afraid the number of them is getting smaller every year. I like his films in the 80s and 90s, and I admit `Today You Die' is not as bad as `The Foreigner,' but that isn't saying much
These are great fun!  My daughter loves to shake them and sing.  Brightly colored and good quality. They are fun for the whole family and just the right size for small hands.  They are good for play other than just musical, as they can be sorted according to color (if you get more than one) and put into things and taken out again; they lend themselves to hours of fun
These are truly good gluten-free cookies.  We have recently made the switch over to a casein-free (milk free) gluten-free diet for the sake of my son.  He is already a picky eater, so I was worried about the transition.  These cookies provided him with a yummy replacement snack for snack time that competes with the snacks that are being served (ie in church school etc).  He is particularly enamored with them because they have kid-friendly animal imprints.  Being gluten free, they do tend to break more, which can be upsetting for young kids, but they taste so good, he has been able to overcome this fault and is even willing to eat the broken pieces. 
This is a toy that my son always wants to play with and we've had this dinosaur for quite a while now.  Usually, we buy our son a toy that he pleads for (he likes it soooooo much) and it looks like fun but then it ends up in the back of his closet after a few days of playing with it.  This brontosaurus makes a booming sound with his feet when you pull a trigger underneath which both my sons love (4 & 2) and the included figures are great.  This toy stands up to the brutual tug of war that accompanies our two small boys and it is quite the bargain at the price.  I highly recommend all of the dinosaurs and cavemen in this series.  Not only does it keep my sons busy (oh yeah)  but it also helps built their imagination as I hear them tell each other all these stories about their dinosaurs.  Imaginext has even come out with "NEW" dinosaurs in this line which can be found at Target or other stores (I have found that TRU has a limited selection). 
I bought three of these for my two 6 year olds and my 7 year old.  Every one of them arrived in abysmal condition.  Strings everywhere... loose tuning screws that could not be tightened... and scratches.  I could not believe that anyone would sell something this inferior.  Shocking is an understatement describing this purchase
What a brilliant package!  It's a squeezebottle with a brush at the end, and has a twist on lid.  No spills, no mess, no disaster.  Love it! ---  --- It is easy to apply with the brush.  I have Lava Flow, which is a shimmery pink.  The shimmer is a more obvious than I would like, as it's big flecks of sparkle, but it isn't so bad that it looks like glitter glue.  There is a strong smell and taste, sorta tropical; although it isn't unpleasant, it is powerful.  Kinda reminds me of red Koolaid.  The color is a bright pink when first applied, but simmers down to a medium pink and is rather sheer.  In the container the color looks unwearable, but in reality it isn't dramatic.   ---  --- The only drawback is how sticky it feels.  It is less sticky than Mac's Lipglass, but more so than Urban Decay XXX, if that makes sense.   ---  --- I got this as a freebie and I'm glad I got to try it.  I would buy it but in a different color
After watching Myth Busters use one of these hammers during one of their tests. My father said we should buy a couple of these since we live in an area with quite a few rivers and lakes. The lifehammers appear to be very well made and I fully expect them to do their job if ever needed. The Sheriffs Office just recently pulled a body out of a local river, his jeep had gone off the road and ended up in the river, his girlfriends body was found right away, but it took several months to find his body. If they had had a lifehammer perhaps this accident would have ended better. The LifeHammer is cheap life insurance
The book appears to give comprehensive coverage in terms of the number and type of entries included.  However, on the Atkins diet, the important measure to monitor is the "active" carbohydrate mass which may  metabolised and which excludes roughage or fiber.  The inclusion of such a  measure in the book would greatly enhance its value and utility
 will not hold bose souround spkrs, will not mount for key hole speakers, also  i paid $11.99 for these on amazon, the saw them in wal-mart for $7.78 good for a cheap system, but if your speakers  weigh more than 5 lbs.  step u
Only the top 1/4 of the wipes are warm... if you don't refill the container continously, wipes get cold.  Plus, you might consider the ease of use with a pop-up warmer
I have been procrastinating in upgrading our website so I figured I'd read a few books... a great way to procrastinate some more.  Well Marcia writes in a step by step practical way, creating a marketing foundation first then getting to the beef.  I'm now educated and inspired, have a notebook full of notes and ideas that I'm actually implementing.  It's getting done.  I'm actually recommending this book to friends who are redoing their marketing message since the first two chapters do that so well... great book, not heavy, beefy info
Contrary to popular belief, I even had a good experience the one time I needed technical support. A few random disconnects, but overall a great product
If you've read anything already about these techniques - writing it down, visualizing it, tithing - this book offers no additional insights. And despite his "Official Religious Disclaimer" at the beginning of the book, it is packed to the rafters with the author's own religious dogma. If you share the author's religious outlook you may like this book, but otherwise it makes for very tedious reading
The jersey of our #54 got here for my wife in time for Super Bowl and she was very happy.(With the jersey NOT Grossman
I just bought 5 pairs of dickies everyday scrubs (from another online company) and was very disappointed. I picked Dickies because they were cute, cheaper than most, and seemed like they would last. The colors are really nice, but the light pastel colors are almost see-through. I tried them on and was able to see my patterned underpants through the scrubs. The ankles are tapered, not obnoxiously so, but definitely tapered. The medium bottoms have a HUGE amount of extra fabric in the belly. The fabric is rough, and feels like plastic
My favourite tea in loose leaf form... it just doesn't get any better than this.  The tins are a good size (not so small that it's gone after four cups of tea but not so large that it'll be stale and moldy before you could possibly finish it) that fit nicely in my desk at work as well as on the counter by the teapot.  The tea is fresh and flavourful with the quality I've come to expect from Twinings.
If you are looking for a book that does a cover to cover job of bashing western civilization with complete and obvious bias, this is it.
This holster offer's your phone ZERO protection.  Not to mention the fact that bumping into something can oftern knock the phone out of the holster.  While it does allow the phone to swivel, thus avoiding being stabbed by the antenna when seated, I ended up being the stabbing victim of the belt clip instead. ---  --- Not to mention the wear and tear from the phone hitting the pavement. ---  --- All in all, I would NOT recommend this holster.  I'm shopping for a holster and faceplate as we speak..
Koyaanisqatsi took seven years to make, from 1975 to 1982. There is not a narration to tell you what to think. This is an art film, in my opinion, the value is up to the viewer: Is this film meaningful? Does it have value? As a viewer I say yes. This film is a fusion of music and image. In Koyaanisqatsi there are 17 pieces of music and five movements all have relative relationship to one another. The "Grid" is a polyrhythmic piece of music. There are 11 polyrhythimic structues going on at once, and it matches with the time lapsed photography that is occuring on screen. About 350,000 feet of film was shot. There definitely was a method to this madness: after the explosion of the Grid, these polyrhythmic structures settle the audience down and the film ends the way it began: a rocket ship taking off. --- Godfrey Reggio more than expected a negative reaction by some people when he made this film.  --- What does this film mean? That is up to the viewer, like a piece of art work there may be a thousand or more interpretations related to this film. Is this film only for certain individuals? Probably. But I don't think there is any pretense in interpretating this films message. One does not have to pretend to like or dislike an art object; it has no intrisic meaning or value only what can be ascribed to it by the viewer. --- Godfrey stated that Koyaanisqatsi is related to Northern Hemisphere societies; super-sophisticated, hyper-industrial, technological grids that we call societies.  --- To me this film is about how humans have become one with machines. And how we don't live with nature any longer. We have become not affected by technology so much more that we have become so engrained in it we can no longer see out of it. That technology becomes the host in which everything happens and in that way, we do not use technology, it is a way of life. But like the air we breath we can not distance ourselves, as we deny that we are separate from technology and instead of moving us toward control of nature it has alienated us instead. The norms of nature no longer fully exist; it is rather the norms of technology that do. And in so doing technology has become omnipresent. Personally I don't have to pretend to like this film or pretend it is important. In fact it is, as its message is perhaps even more significant today as the world moves even closer to a homogenized society at the expense of natural and human diversity.This film shows that homogenization is in this process of globalization
Well it was an obvious path to musical collapse, she should have stopped at Tidal.  If I'd been dating her for the talent she showed on her first CD I would have broken up with her over this piece of haggis.  The course of the last three CD's drew a trendline right from stardom into a melodic pit.  The lyrics on Extraordinary Machine were not only not up to their namesake but worse than the melodies.  The number of great reviews on this site only go to prove once again the masses prefer pablum in lieu of something complex and cognitive. ---  --- Her original Cd with it's collection of diminished and augmented chords set to deep overlays of texturing, blended with truly poetic lyrics has been replaced with a distilled musical joke.  What on earth gave her the impetus to try to go 'artsy' by experimenting with music predating the second world war I'll never know.  It's obvious her angst is no longer producing art, rather it is being replaced with contrived resolution and the equivalent of a musical epitaph.   ---  --- Eat it up people, it's all about not having to think.  It's the kind of tripe that happens when someone is trying to hard to think of how to outdo their first brush stroke of genius and is confronted with musical block.  Judging by the news her father is ruining her life and creativity as so often is the case in todays less than feminine half of the culture.  
I bought this classic novel on cd thinking it would hold the interest of my 2 grade school boys, who enjoy books on cd while driving to and from school.  They did not like the narrator's snobby french accent nor could they understand many of the words.  This is a great cd for high school or adults but not children.  A bust for us. 
Purchased this for my girlfriend.  Told me that fits well and was very happy with this.  I am glad to get such a good price on them too
I had high expectations for these socks given my previous experiences with the brand. The socks were too narrow in the foot and too tight around the ankle. They are not comfortable to wear and overall, a big disappointment
If you're only slightly interested in the ways the evolution works, then this is it. But beware to have some knowledge about the basics of evolution before moving on to this book. There's a bit of a steep learning curve when you're not all to familiair with Darwin's brilliant theory. It also gives a nice insight in the way scientists work
A great magazine that keeps getting better as time goes on. I have watched it from the start and have continued to be impressed by Editor Jason Sizemore's growing tome to the darker side of Sci-Fi. With solid Interviews and strong fiction by established pros like William F. Nolan, Ben Bova, Tom Piccirilli, Neil Gaiman and Brian Keene and talented newcomers like Bryn Sparks, Jenifer Pelland, and Eugie Foster you can't miss with this one
I have seen this movie many times while growing up.  Its definately a different approach to Science Fiction, but not too bad.  Basically, you get to see how mortal enemies can work out their differences, and work together.  A movie with a message
fast shipping... great product .. very easy to use.. i highly reccomend this product if you dont want to deal with complicated  --- wiring and difficult to install alarms. this products works fine and VERY easy to work with
I'm dealing with getting old but I was surprised to find that I could no longer tune my guitar by ear. In fact, I was thinking the problem was with my old guitars. --- I decided to get a tuner. I did some research here on amazon and decided on this one. --- Reasonable price and the instrument store shipped in good time. --- The first time I used it I wished I had bought it sooner. --- Easy to use with either the lights or the needle. The guitars sounded great. --- As others have said: --- It's a little difficult to use the needle in a dark setting but the red/green lights are accurate. --- A simple flip out stand would be a big help. Plugging in a cord jack makes it very awkward to position. That being said the idea of putting a groove on the back of the thing so you can insert a credit, business or playing card to lean it against is both odd and better than nothing. --- Will have to see how long it holds up but I am very happy with it and I will use the instrument store again. --- 
I was very disappointed with this pump. It was very loud and stopped working after 3 weeks, and I only used it once a day. Even more disappointing was the companys return policy. You have to ship it to them at your expense, wait for them to send you a new one, and return that one to the store. Do not waste your time
I just received this locket, which was intended to be a gift for my niece for x-mas, and had to decline on giving it to her.  when i received it, i actually thought Amazon forgot to put it in the bag it came in.  I shook the bag, felt for the necklace, and finally out popped this itty bitty tiny heart pendant. it's so small, i thought it was more suitable for her doll then for herself. i was very disappointed. other then the size and over priced tag, i thought it was cute - but i will be returning it. --- sorry
My 4ish daughter LOVES this magazine, as do we. Each issue gets pretty tattered while she waits for the next issue. ---  --- Educational (for all of us) and entertaining.  She remembers the information given to her in the short and concise articles and enjoys testing us to see if we were paying attention. ---  --- A keeper for sure
The set look very nice.  The description DOES say that the cymbals are not included, so I will have to buy them separate.  I am buying this set for my nephew for Christmas.  He is in a band!  I hope he likes it
This my first pair of 100% nylon socks.  The problem I have is that my feet cannot breathe in them.  My socks are wet after a full day wearing them. I guess I'll just have to stay with cotton...I've never had that problem before with cotton/polyester socks. They do stay up above my calf all day long, though.
I received my phone and everything was good.  When I looked at my bill Amazon did not close out my previous 2 months I had left on my contract with Cingular.  So Cingular tried to charge me some liquidation fee of $30.  I called and had it removed
As a frequent visitor to the Himalayas and being closely in touch with both Tibetans (ordinary folks, not the tortured ones) and the Chinese, I find this documentary interesting but terribly one-sided. I have not met a single wealthy Tibetan in Nepal or India, who can swear to me that he will return to a freed Tibet, run by their government in exile.  ---  --- To be fair to the "experts", a lot of the evidence of Chinese violence against the Tibetans is real. I sincerely feel sorry for them and wish that they could somehow be compensated. However, the documentary gets emotive and it seems bent on presenting the situation in Tibet entirely from the viewpoint of the activists and other victims of Chinese aggression. ---  --- While it is true that many Tibetans suffered and died during the invasion and subsequent crushing of riots that erupted from time to time, it is unfair to assume that the soldiers and police were the only ones responsible for the deaths and injuries. Were there no looters, vandals, infighting? If you had ever witnessed these riots, would you think that more people might have been hurt or killed had the soldiers not opened fire? ---  --- It's also incredibly naive to assume that all Tibetans think the same. Even Dharamsala, the seat of the Tibetan government in exile is not without opposition, violence and even assasination. While I do think that most Tibetans are good Buddhists and nice people, the documentary seems to associate everything sinful with the Chinese and everything saintly with the Tibetans. This is something I find totally unacceptable. ---  --- A few snapshots of Tibetan mobs welcoming the delegates from exile tell us nothing. The documentary seems only able to find Tibetans who are against Chinese rule. They paint the picture that nobody in Tibet is happy. This is patently untrue. But then, this sort of thing sells in America. You have to have a demon, you have to have a damsel in distress and you must have the hero (America in this case). Otherwise, it just won't sell. It's not about compassion at all. ---  --- If you really want to be "illuminated", visit Tibet and Tibetan communities all over China and see things for yourself. That would be far more enlightening. Sadly, many journalists prefer to interview the wrong (right?) people in order to get a sensational story that will pay for the rent
First I would like to say that when I purchased this item it was advertised as the "Hobby" addition.  When I received it I didn't think it was the hobby set so I called amazon, the operator said she did not know about this product and provided me with the phone number to who sold it to me.  I called that number 3 times and left a message each time to please call me and I have yet to receive a phone call back.. When I gave this item to my husband for Christmas he confirmed my thought that it was not the "Hobby" addition.  I was not only upset that I did not get what I was looking for but that no one had returned my call
On install the 1st problem encountered was that it replaced  my pictures folder, with another containing only "sample picture", yep  it took out a folder on install with no request or user action to do so. Regardless of how it works as an image editor such behaviour precludes its further use.  ---  --- This program seems to be unsupported by MicroSoft, least their support site won't let you mail them on it,  so when it does hack up your file structure. SO program cost me $15 recovery effort on pictures, over $50. Just wonderful.
I loved this show and have been waiting for it to come out on something so I could watch the episodes again...I can't wait for season two to come out. If you were a fan of this show, you have to get it..
You don't want this one.  Although the fabric is appealing (calm stripes vs. the buzy themes of the other covers) this cover will not fit most shopping carts.  It only fits the carts found at small city super markets.  If you are a suburbian shopper you'll have to spend the bucks for  a more satisfactory product
very comfy and warm, my only downfall is that I could have sworn i read that two came in one set.  I ordered one thinking i was going to get two covers.  I have to order it again...darn
A family oriented film that is humorous, fun, exciting and very entertaining! After seeing this movie for the first time, I had to own it! It is hard to find a good comedy that is enjoyable for all ages that is clean. This is a must own for the family
This seatsaver is one of the few wide enough and tall enough for SUVs.  In contrast to one of the other reviews (and I am NOT affiliated with the seat manufacturer), this seat does the job adequately, and one should not post a poor rating without researching the specs, measurements, fit, etc., IMHO.  There is no "universal" seat saver or, for that matter, car seat, that will fit every car.  This one manages to catch most of the itty-bitty things that kids manage to somehow accumulate and is sturdy enough for the car seat not to make indentations on the actual seat, and hence, serves its purpose well
This is my favorite tea.  It's strong and spicy, and to me tastes like cinnamon and orange.  I prefer it hot but like it cold, especially in the summer.  I think it's the best thing on winter mornings
I bought the Meade CaptureView 8X42 1.3MP Digital Camera Binocular. The first one had software / hardware that hung up after 3 pictures, the second one had so many pixels missing from the screen it was unreadable, the third one wouldnt turn on and the black side flashing fell off on removal from the box. --- A truely tatty product
My Xbox was getting the red rings of death, figured this was most likely due to overheating, so I bought this thing. Not only did it not fix any of my troubles, I was having more. Whenever I would bump my Xbox, the whole thing would shut-off instantly. Found this out by accident, come to find out this thing has very bad connections. So for $20 you can buy more headaches than Microsoft is pawning off onto us game addicts...
I have multiple concerns with this product. Out of the box, they really do look fresh and plump like they do in the picture.  ---  --- However, you soon notice the lack of instructions. None. The only documentation at all is a "California" sticker... with no reference to a web site. Nada. ---  --- My grapes broke quickly. When I received them they looked just like the picture. But in a couple days I started noticing they weren't as plump and were shriveling. Withing a week, many were brown and certainly lacked freshness. It was so bad, that I was in shock, and I kept holding up the picture next to them to compare because I couldn't believe it. It was like they were deteriorating right before my eyes. ---  --- Within a month they looked awful. They looked like moldy raisins. Really Moldy. ---  --- Not recommended
Tony Nourmand's "Film posters of the 60's" is a wonderful and  colorful coffee table style book that is a great treat to look through.  There are many of the classic film poster images of the French New wave,  the films of Stanley Kubrick and the classic 007 posters, just to name a  few. Film poster collecting is a great adventure and this book reflects  that enthusiasm. This book was lovingly organized with great detail. A  superb value! Looking forward to future editions
Egad! Upon receiving this remote control, I found that it requires four AAA batteries. There was no mention of that requirement in the product description! I concur with the other review writer: the control is top heavy, and I would add poorly designed. It's thick at the top and thin at the bottom, making it unwieldy. I will be returning this monstrosity
The product, if reviewed just on taste, would only warrant a two, but the convenience is worth a five.  It is probably the best La Briute product that I have found.  It is a two minute meal that is not completely objectionable, but it is way too salty
I have two children now, and I wish this item had been available when my older daughter was born.  I have tried everything to keep my babies' heads from slumping over in the car, and nothing worked 100% of the time.  This however does.  It is one of the best things I have ever purchased for my child and it's very inexpensive
Once again Mr. Updike delivers an insightful story of life in suburbia and what lurks in the hearts and minds of men and women  - love, lust, betrayal, self doubt.  Villages relates Owen's life as only John Updike can.  The last chapter gets a little too long and not as enjoyable as the rest of the book, but I will certainly recommend it to all my friends
 this is a nice smooth green tea. actually, I have tried many flavors of Yogi tea, and they are all lovely. bedtime tea really does put me gently off to sleep. egyptian licorice has a nice little bite to it, and the women's formulas help with hormonal issues. I have not found a bad flavor. : 
I bought this camera after owning an Olympus digital camera for years. I was extremely happy with my Olympus, but wanted something smaller that would fit in my purse or diaper bag since I'm expecting. This camera was SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT. Just about every single picture I took had huge white blobs all over it. (This only happened when using the flash. I must admit the camera takes great pictures in broad daylight without the flash.) Plus, if you used the zoom at all, the pictures came out fuzzy. The first digital camera I ever owned (7 years ago) took better pictures! The store I bought the camera from wouldn't take it back because I waited two days past the 14-day return policy. So, I sold the camera and took a $100 loss. I'd much rather lose $[...] than keep this camera
This stand is very professional looking and is light weight.  It is very easy to manage when going from home to rehearsals and concerts while carrying an instrument.  It is very sturdy and easy to put together
The product does not work in my view. I have to review every card and have to manually correct the extracted information in 95% of the cases. It is not much different than entering the information manually. The character recognition software has a long way to go to be effective. Does not even recognize that "wireless" is the mobile phone number. One would think that they would get it right after all these versions and years. The only good thing is once you scan the cards, you can throw them away, but still have to spend the same amount time entering the information by hand.
I subscribe to all of the home and garden magazines and Southern Accents is the best, bar none.  The houses featured are absolutely dreamy--the photography is gorgeous--and while the magazine doesn't offer how-to decorating ideas, there is so much inspiration.  I find it to be intelligently written...which is rare in a decorating magazine. The articles on antiques are particularly informative.  This magazine will appeal to anyone who is interested in beautiful, classic design--whether or not you live in the South
About the Band: --- Dead Can Dance is considered the seminal example of the ethereal or heavenly voices genre.  In fact, the name of the label, 4AD, which carried many of the 1990s DCD releases, is sometimes also used to describe this genre of music, which is a fusion of subtle electronics, vocals, drums, world music, and a near limitless count of instruments.  Brendan Perry sometimes has been described as a gothic Frank Sinatra.  Lisa Gerrard's enchanting vocals are often sung in a language only known to Lisa.  I count myself among the many that hold these two musicians in the highest esteem. ---  --- About the Album: --- Compared to more recent albums that are loaded with bonus tracks, the 50-minutes of Into the Labyrinth would seem short, if it weren't for the fact that I like to listen to this album over and over again.  I count this album as one of my all time favorites, and certainly my most prized Dead Can Dance CD. ---  --- One of the nicest things about this album is that it features nearly equal amounts of both Lisa's and Brendan's ghostly vocals.  On some tracks they accompany each other, while others feature only one of the artist's chilling or mystical sounding vocals.  Simply put, this is beautiful music to relax to.  I honestly give this album my highest recommendations! ---  --- Two tracks I'd recommend sampling: "Towards the Within" (featuring Lisa's vox w/ Brendan backing) and "Tell Me About the Forest" (featuring Brendan's vox).  I believe they best represent the range of songs you can expect with this album.  Please note that while all the tracks feature vocals, the lyrics for only those sung in English are included in the liner notes. ---  --- Similar Artists: --- Chances are if you aren't yet familiar with Dead Can Dance, that you've not yet discovered some of these other bands, but I highly recommend them as well: Das Zeichen, Impressions of Winter, Love is Colder Than Death, Qntal, Corvus Corax, or Helium Vola.  There is a rather large (and somewhat underappreciated) range of artists still producing heavenly voices music that is similar in quality to Dead Can Dance.  Please check some of them out as well.
I put a great deal of interest in my purchases. With a lot of extra down-time at work and an internet connection, I find myself reviewing EVERYTHING before I buy it. And only after I am very impressed and convinced by many positive reviews will I take out my credit card. But this product, the Microsoft XBOX360 Media Remote, was one exception having read many bad reviews and deciding to purchase it anyway. Let me tell you... ---  --- This remote is PERFECT if... ---  --- 1. You would like one, easy-to-use remote to control both basic TV and an Xbox 360 that doubles as your DVD player. --- 2. The only buttons you would need for the TV are: Channels, Volume (TV speaker/output control only), Numerical channel input, Muting, *INTPUT SELECTION* (yes, it CAN switch between your TV's inputs), Return (to toggle between 2 TV channels), and Power. --- 3. You do not need specialized/advanced buttons found on a OEM remote or advanced learning remote for the TV. --- 4. You do not need to control a A/V receiver, DVD player (other than XBOX 360), or a digital cable box (Tivo, DVR, etc.) --- 5. You are on a budget but would still like a quality remote. ---  --- If you can say yes to all or most, then don't hesitate to grab one of these remotes. You will be completely satisfied. Especially with immediate access to the tactile DVD buttons versus the 360's annoying on-screen DVD navigation. For this feature it is almost worth the $30 alone. ---  --- P.S. --- I also own a Logitech Harmony 880 for the living room which I highly recommend for anyone not fitting into the catagory mentioned above
I bought this product based on my research of users opinions and found it has lived up to their high opinions.  I have boxes of family photos as well as numerous camcorder tapes of family events.  I wanted an easy comprehensive program that would let me arrange photos and video clips, add music and burn on a DVD.  This program does it all and more.  It may not do everything extremely well, but for the price, well enough to put out an impressive DVD.  After about two hours of getting familiar with the program, I was able to create a DVD that had 35 pictures and a video clip with background music - stunning results.  I played the DVD on several different brands of DVD players and had no problems.  Looks great on TV.  I've had no problems running the program on my computer - I'm running this on a Pentium IV 2.9 GHz, 1 gig ram and 200 GB ram HD.  Since I am a beginner/weekend hobbyist, this suites my purpose of sharing pictures with family - I'm finding much better to share on DVD than paper photos.  For an all-in-one package at this price, it does the job very well and I would recommend it.  
Having tried Senseo pods, Millstone, etc.  I was surprised that good old Folgers is just as good and in some cases better than Senseo's newer flavors.  While made for the Home Cafe these fit Senseo coffee makers and give you a good cup for a lot less than the more upscale brands
It's a pretty convinient bag.I put a Canon rebel XT with a Tamron 28-75 lens,a Canon 70-300 lens and a external flash inside and I still have the small pocket for wallet,keys etc. --- The only drawback of this bag is,you can not put in big lenses.The Canon 70-300 is the limit.But if you only have a limited gear collection,you need to give it a try
Here is a magazine that focuses on modern design and clean-line architecture without the trendy vibe that makes a competitor like "Wallpaper" an expensive, hit-or-miss read. What I like most about "Dwell" is its consistency in presenting interesting designs from around the world that look quite livable and fashionable at the same time. Even the advertisements are quite compatible to the flow of the magazine, so much so that they often look like they are part of the editorial. There is a very useful "Marketplace" section at the end that tells you where to get a lot of the art, furniture and accessories complementary to the designs presented. I have often used these helpful listings to find some interesting things for my own place.  ---  --- This magazine is definitely geared toward the urban loft dweller, but I like how they highlight homes with families in mind as well. Individual issues are often focused on either geographic or utility-related themes, thus keeping a library mandatory for future reference. The photography is superb. If you are tired of design magazines that seem to be talking specifically to designers, this is a great, reasonably priced alternative for people who simply appreciate great design. Highly recommended
As my brother said when flipping through this book, "If girls start acting like guys then what do we need them for?"  Why should you pretend to be someone or something you're not to get a guy?  If someone dumps you because you like mushy love songs, cry at sad movies, like babies and puppies, or because you have embarrassing girl products in your medicine cabinet, he isn't worth it anyway!  And why on earth would you sleep with someone who didn't love you enough to want you around the next morning?  "Think Like a Guy" doesn't guarantee you a perfect relationship anymore than The Rules or Stop Getting Dumped or Mars and Venus or any of the other ridiculous relationship books that have been popular over the last few years.  Be yourself.  If a man can't deal with that, then he isn't the right one for you
I absolutely love this scale!  It is easy to program and enjoyable to use.  Best of all, it's beautiful to behold
These are the BEST bibs.   I have tried many.   They do not peel, crack, etc.   I have used the same set of bibs for 2 years.   I just bought a set for my sister.   Worth the money
Pls tell me tat tis BoxSet is a JOKE!!!! Classic Rock - REO, Romantics ... BANGLES??? its more like Classic New Wave. Only thing good would be the price. Pls ... who ever the A&R people are ... pls ... pls ... design something bette
As much as I hear time and again that "Mindcrime" was the Seattle quintet's finest, I always have to argue that this 1986 gem is the pinnacle of their career. While I was a big fan of Mindcrime and it's predecessor "The Warning", Rage For Order is QR's most consistent release and is mezmerising from start to finish. In a word.."perfect". --- So few bands can boast having made a perfect album. I can think only of The Beatles (Sgt. Pepper & Revolver to name a few), Pink Floyd (The Wall, Dark Side), Dream Theater (Images & Awake), and Boston (Debut). Rage is an album to be listened to and appreciated. Released in the hey-day of "hair metal", this album has not one single song that lends itself to the tag. None of the songs, while very image provoking, could be easily made into an MTV hit. Although "Gonna Get Close To You" aired on MTV (rarely I might add) it didn't even scratch the surface of this album's potential.  --- Overall, the performances of each member outshine anything before, or since. DeGarmo and Wilton trade licks masterfully. Rockenfield and Jackson keep a very tight bottom end. Tate...well...Tate was THE metal singer at that time and this was his finest performance. --- While the mix was somewhat lacking, the production was incredible. Each song blends into each other perfectly. This was metal that was unique and completely original. I think the term "thinking man's metal" was coined at the time. That said, I can think of no other release at the time to which that term could be applied. Unlike most of their metal contemporaries at the time, Rage was athmospheric, intellectual, and surreal. Rage succeeded where Priest's "Turbo" failed abysmally. It was a stark vision of the future and the metal was more futuristic than we'd ever heard before. It was like listening to a whole new machine. It still holds it's own 20 year later, seeming as fresh and "now" as anything in progressive metal.
I just bought this camera and took it to one of my kid's indoor soccer games. The light was low, but not that low.  You should be able to take a picture without the flash. When I took the flash off, the picture looked fine on the preview, but came out completely black.  Yet the camera was able to take perfectly fine video at the same light level!  What a disappointment.  I am going to try to return it
I bought this necklace for my 5 year old Granddaughter.  The piece is beautiful, and has some weight to it.  Its very well made, and no one would guess the price I paid.  More than worth the price
The dual grips are kind of handy - it fits securely into place
It was simple to install on top of my RV. I was able to put a cover over the panel and keep getting the sunlight to charge the batteries. It charges even through glass on the inside of the RV
Colin Firth plays a teacher and passionate to the point of obsessive football (soccer for Americans) fan who manages to mangle his only functional relationship, thanks to his tunnel vision when it comes to his obsession and fanatical support for Arsenal. His self-centered attitude with no concern at all for his girlfriend's interests muck up what could be a good relationship. On the other hand, it is hard to see in the first place what the woman finds so appealing about Firth's character, Paul. Perhaps because she is so uptight and needs to loosen up and sees in him a way by which to learn to be less rigid. She attempts to get involved in HIS passion but does not quite have the rabid, feverish passion he has. Eventually the fact that he identifies himself so closely with his football club and its ups and downs leads to the demise of the relationship, but she comes to see that she likes his identity, which is strong, linked to football or not. She has also been carried away by a certain infectious passion about football because it is so much a part of his life. Of course, one could argue that this tale is a sad reflection on the idea that there is a genderlect and that women suffer more in terms of being able to communicate, but that belies the point here that sometimes an imperfect person can still be perfect for someone who loves him, faults, obsessions and all
    They say it will be delivered in its original carton, but they don't mention they have been opening up the boxes and swapping out the new console boxes with returned ones. ---  ---     The box came with two bright yellow strapping bands, and certainly looked sealed when I signed for it at delivery. Later that evening, when I cut the bands I was surprised when the top lifted open, the staples on the carton top were not attached and the box was already open. I cut the box open and started laying the parts out. when I pulled the carton containing the console out, the box end flap was open and smashed up where it had been put into the styrofoam. every thing else looked undisturbed. I pulled the console out of the box and could see that it must have been returned, the bubble wrap was torn, and the six screws to mount it were missing. ---  ---    I called schwinn and they are going to send me the six missing screws, and I called Amazon to tell them what was going on, I would have sent it back, but I had cut the box open and don't think there is any way I could cram it all back together.  ---  ---    Just look the box over carefully when they deliver it, the staples on the top were carefully centered between the holes where the longer staples that originally sealed the box were removed. They sure fooled me into accepting a opened box.
If you want UNCUT ORIGINAL version, ALWAYS look for ORIGINAL LICENSED Production. NOT US Release. Its a foreign film, it should not be US version to begin with~! HELLO!!!?? Why settle for LESS with US Version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with Jackie's Fighting Scenes. And US Release ruins the speed and sound as well.I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality. American Market always like to "Americanize" and "Control". Regional Code Regulation thing is one of the example to CONTROL the Market. Why not let everyone enjoy the same HK Original Release move the same way REST OF THE WORLD enjoys it ?? No one makes Hollywood American movies to "French version" or "Chinese Version" ~! This what Americans are doing~! Well, enjoy the cheap "American version" then~! LO
I really wanted a 3CCD model, but since I'm just starting out and need to buy other stuff, like a tripod, monopod, media, firewire adapter card, camera bag, etc. This fits the budget nicely and it is compact enough to carry it anywhere. Yes the USB connection does work, yes FireWire does work, although it took me a minute to figure out that a connection problem was the fault of the video software version I was using, not the fault of the camera
The Superyard was a fantastic buy for us consider that it has allowed us time to have dinner together in a marginal civilized fashion.  Our 9 months old loves to play in it specially since she can see us through it.  You can hook a bunch of toys to it to keep your child entertained.
Finally, an ab video that makes sense and works.  This video is truly innovative and unique.  Imagine having rock hard abs and great core strength without doing a sit up or a crunch.  You have to see it to believe it!  Mike Griffith makes this video fun, easy to follow, and very challenging for the beginner or most conditioned athlete.  With a short amount of time and minimal equipment, this program will stretch and strenghten your abs in a functional way.  I am a physical therapist and I use these techniques for patients with back pain as well as for performance improvement for athletes.  I have been using it myself, and it works
WHEN I FIRST TIME USED IT,IT'S BORKEN. --- AND I CAN NOT RETURN OR EXCHANGE WITHOUT BO
I purchased this product needing to work on a personal legal (nonbusiness) matter, so the noncommercial license was fine for my "home" use.  Good thing I checked with Corel after buying it and seeing the "Home Edition" captions not only on the total suite packaging but underneath the "WordPerfect" and "Quattro Pro" components (inside front box folding cover with velcro).  Corel ultimately confirmed to me that "certain components that are designed for the business customer, such as Legal Tools, MetaData Removal, Document Compare, Quickfinder to name a few are not included in the Home Edition version."  Corel needs to make this clearer in their marketing of the "Home Edition."  I focused on the word processing application, but the Quattro Pro application is also captioned as "Home Edition" so it may be missing some features available in the Quattro Pro included in other Suite versions (Standard, Pro, Student/Teacher, etc.).  The Home Edition may still be suitable for some users, but I'm a strong believer in "full disclosure."  WordPerfect itself is a great program.  Try setting point sizes with decimals in Word -- you can't.  Try changing the size of the font in legal pleadings in Word -- there's no direct control of it (the Microsoft site instructs you to change margins and number of lines per page to attempt to get Word to adjust the font size) [but remember, you need any WordPerfect version other than Home Edition to get Legal Tools]
I purchased the product, used it for 2 days and it has not worked since.  The compnay has yet to respond to my request for return, and Amazon excepts no liabilty.  Needless to say I wasted money
The product I ordered was not actually for sale!  Don't post an product if you don't have it in stock
The only good thing about this book is that it was short. Even in writing about a great man with incredible contributions to our country, Gary Hart repeats himself over and over and over and over again. OK, the Monroe Doctrine is important, I GET IT! ---  --- I read about 2 or 3 presidential biographies per month and I cannot remember a book as bad as this. If you want a quick view of James Monroe, you can read the first chapter and skip the rest but this book is not good for more than that
Lancome's Juicy Tubes in Simmer tastes like my beverage of choice, Orange Julius.  When you apply it, it feels like you're rubbing the tip of an orange creamsicle ice cream pop onto your lips (minus the cold, minus the cream).  The color is a very subtle pink-ish beige, but it provides enough glossy shimmer to keep your lips a-simmer!  This is my 4th tube of juicy (also a big fan of Spring Fling & Berry Bold) and so far this is my favorite flavor
This program does exactly as I expect. I am very pleased
If you are looking for accuracy and durability do not by this product
This kit will not only help you get started, it will help you stay with the program too
The X-Pad is a decent piece of equipment, doing a good job of keeping my laptop from getting too hot. My only issue with it is the lack of padding on the underside. I'm going to have to attach a piece of neoprene or something similar to make it more comfortable to have on my lap.
I was GREATLY disappointed in this DVD. Here's why: ---  --- 1. It's basically 60 minutes of warming up --- 2. The level 3 (advanced) is not THAT HARD. --- 3. The annoying "inhale, exhale" chant really makes it difficult to find my 'center.' I just wanted to tell her SHUT UP --- 4. I didn't break a sweat once.  --- 5. I used it twice and never plan to use it again. I mean, c'mon, I don't want to waste 1 hour of my day on something that won't get me results.  ---  --- I must say the ONLY THING positive about this DVD is the landscape.  ---  --- In short, rent this from Blockbuster or buy it used. Don't waste any more than 5 bucks on this. It's not worth it. 
I bought this slick looker for the desk in my office. I had a beat up 20 yo digital clock radio that had poor sound.However its tuner worked ok and I figured with the Tivoli rep I'd get some good listening along with the good looks. My office is inside the facility without windows so reception can be tricky...the tuner for the PA speakers in the rest of the office has to have the antenna just right. I was very frustrated to find that the radio simply couldnt hold a signal. A station would tune in  nice but the fade in and out to barely hearable. I bought an amplified antenna but didnt help. Then I tried it in a windowed room and same problem......I was very disapointed
SELLER WAS VERY TIMELY IN SENDING THE DVD AND THE QUALITY WAS AS DESCRIBED
Donot buy it. I got the stuff even past the expiration day
I was never a Richard Burton fan until I discovered this movie.Richard Burton's acting in this movie is top notch.Burton is able to pull you into his character of British agent Alec Leamas and make it all believable.Thankfully the movie is in black and white,because it adds to the overall suspense and mood of the film.The dvd transfer and digital 5.1 sound are excellent.It's hard to believe a movie from 1965 with no fancy gadgets or special computer effect's could be so entertaining,but it is.The question is will Alec come in from the cold or does he have one more mission in him
I registered for the entire Locomotion collection before my son was born and have been very happy with it. I love the theme, but the mobile was a big disappointment. It didn't fit the crib properly and although my husband tried to figure out a way to install it without any type of conversion kit available, he just couldn't attach it safely and we ended up returning it. Also, although the mobile matches the theme, I found that the colors weren't very stimulating. ---  --- We bought the Tiny Love Symphony In Motion Mobile instead and although the colors didn't match, our son got many months of enjoyment and stimulation out of it.
I have used these containers and the milk escaped by the time I reached home.
1. they leak --- 2. too expensive --- 3. they don't supply enough lids, so you have to buy more containers --- 4. doesn't work well for feedin
I got this for my mother at Christmas and she loved it. You can't help but notice the pendant when she has it on - Very beautiful design, sleek and stylish.  She gets compliments everytime she wears it. Even though this was just an extra gift I think it turned out to be one of her favorite things
First off I need to tell you that I've carried a swiss knife since I was a kid. I have most of the styles. But this one stands out as the absolute most useful for a rather strange reason. For me since I don't fish I found more uses for this in the most unexpected area. The "fish scaler" tool is one that I would NEVER use to scale fish for no other reason than the problem of having to clean it thoroughly, too much work. But this tool I have used more than any other on all my knives. I've used it to open ceiling hatches to change office lights, pick locks. to measure things (something you need more often than you think), to reach into thin areas to clear debris or push a switch and most of all as a back scratcher. Since there are no sharp edges on the scaler it's perfect to scratch those areas one can't reach. That's not to ignore all the rest of the tools this knife offers which I use except for the absurd "parcel hook". This tool is useless and yet Victorinox continues to install it on many knives. The only useful task I've found for the hook is to tighten one's laces on my boots when I snow shoe. Anyone else found something useful for the parcel hook? Please post it if you have
This was the first time I have bought this and am very pleased with it.  When you open the can, the tuna is in one solid piece and not all sloppy like other brands.  It tastes pretty good too.  Will buy again
it's got an alarm, stop watch, timer, lap timer, 5 alarms actually, a water break alarm, water resistant, although don't go aggressive swimming with it because water leaked inside mine, and when it gets hot outside, water vapor rises to the glass dial and it blurs out the time...but other than that, it's a great watch, finest i've owned in terms of digital watch, i highly recommend it
The Panasonic is very compact, very stylish SEXY as my wife called it, but the photos are very disappointing: they are way to noisy! Even if set on the lowest ASA setting at 80ASA it is just barely acceptable and they do get progressively worse anything above 100ASA. ---  --- The colours are good, and it does take very good videos, but still photos are just plain bad when compared to other cameras in Photoshop CS2. Of course it is easy to understand why: the native resolution of the images. If one investigates such things, will notice that the Panasonic is only 72 dpi, same as Sony's, Canon improves this to 180, and Nikon is at 300 dpi. It is not just about megapixels folks, but how those megapixels are recorded and at what resolution. Obviously a camera with 72 dpi will have more noise than one at 180 or 300 dpi.  ---  --- So before you buy any digital camera or thinking about upgrading to a newer model, do yourself a favour. Try 4 or 5 cameras in the same megapixel range at a good camera store by taking photos of the same subject in the same light condition. Set the camera for the lowest ASA and the highest picture quality in JPG format, take the photos, pop the SD card  into the computer, compare the images in Photoshop. Enlarge to full pixel size (100%), and and look at the meta data at the same time and you will see for yourself. That is what I did, since I was not very happy with the images my Panasonic produced! I had this camera for 11 months and 20 days exactly, and today I traded it in on a Nikon P5000 after evaluating over a dozen models including the Leica D-lux3 10MP camera, and driving the sales persons crazy with all the testing and spending 4 hours at the store, but it was very educational for them too
These work great for keeping the earbuds comfortably in place while allowing one to hear others speaking, say in a grocery store. Of course they do not provide audiophile quality sound, but they're great for listening to podcasts while doing the shopping.  ---  --- The only downside is they are bulky and so do not fit in any earbud holder while not in use. Taking the eargels off to store the earbuds off is possible but difficult enough to be annoying
I got the machine for my fat, muscle and water analysis as well as my weight. After 1 month of use it only shows the weight.  The scale no longer works properly.  It no longer shows anything else but the weight.  It was a waste of money
I purchased this for my husband. He hates to shave everyday and now he can without the razor burn. It is even as close a shave as if he used a razor! I saw it on the Consumers Number One pick for foil shavers and I am glad I went with their reccomendation
As a rule, I like the Seche products.  This polish thinner did not work for me and was a true disappointment.  I wasted my money on this one
Unfortunately ,I purchased this product . Thermometer and compass are not at all working. Thermometer always shows 65 F and Compass allways shows Err. I highly recommend NOT to buy this on
I am a fan of historical fiction, and this has to be one of the most historically inaccurate films I have ever seen! What bothers me the most is that the general public, who hasn't read the Tudor biographies like some of us have, will believe this stuff because it is their only exposure to the subject! I won't go into all the inaccuracies since other reviewers have already touched on them. Why tamper with history, when it was actually more fascinating than what was portrayed in this movie.
I love this product. It is easy to use and lots of designs to chosse from
I bought 2 of these and they are horrible!  Youu put them in and they sometimes work and sometimes dont its such a pain in the arse!
J&R packs them so poorly that over half of them were shattered beyond repair upon arrival
When I bought this CD it was for a little bit of nostalgia - Those Were The Days.  Since playing it once when it blew me away with the tracks and the memories, I have played it so often that if it were vinyl it would be worn out by now.  If you liked Mary Hopkins then this is a fantastic selection of her music and well worth a place in your collection
Wow! I use Pacific Foods beef and chicken stock all the time & I guess I expected more! Convenience isn't worth it if the soup is super salty and tastes processed!!!! Hardly any barley or beef! I cooked up one bag & I'm throwing the rest out
This is a great gift for that person in your family who still thinks fart jokes are funny or for ten year olds.  Only one problem.  Due to inconsistant sizes of jelly beans, the poor raindeer had a...dispensing problem on occaission which requires one to rip off the reindeer's head (thank goodness it's on a hinge) to alleviate the problem,  this could be traumatic to the more sensitive.. MERRY CHRISTMAS!!
I ordered the 50's Style Rockabilly Polka Dot Dress in a 1X. I am a full sized woman with a small waist and a well endowed chest. The cup size for the 1X looked to be about a C cup at the most. I sent back the 1X for the 3X in which the cupsize looked to be a D, the dress has no support what so ever in the chest area so a bra is a must for heavier chested women. The waist and back area was way too large in the 3x. I was not only displeased with the fit but the quality of the material is poor as well. The dots are screenprinted on so after a few washes they will begin to crack and fade, it does say handwash (but even still some of the dots are already lighter than others). I'm giving the dress two stars because the style of the dress is really nice and if you can get it to fit the right way its not a bad price at all, but it's definitely not a dress that your going to have around for a long time.
I'm on no wheat, dairy or sugar diet restrictions, and this is my treat that I really look forward to. (sometimes every day!) Thank you Nana's! And the price is great from Amazon
This is a 'must have' fragrance. It has an exotic scent that will have everyone around you asking "What perfume do you have on?".  It can be worn day or night.  The entire Burberry line is fantastic
Firstly I must say how much I dislike Jennifer Lopez so attempting to watch this movie has been a struggle since it was first released however I decided to brave it out for the sake of Ralph Fiennes.  Lopez plays a maid who falls for a guy who has loads of money (Fiennes, who is miscast, really) He thinks she is a guest in the hotel, she plays along. So she lies about herself for the rest of the movie and when all is revealed, it comes to a ridiculous ending.  There's not much else to say to this cinderella movie, except maybe that it's not funny. Lopez isn't a great actress, she and Fienness have about as much chemistry as a toothbrush in a toiletbowl
I am a busy mom of two young children.  This camera is perfect for capturing all of their cute faces and happy moments.  I love the fast cycle time. I love that I can take multiple pictures in seconds. Would recommend to anyone
I was hoping the book would be good.  most reviews are.  However the topics are not really covered at all, more introduced.  It was like talking to a drunk bloke about sports, most points are important and relevant but its presented in a way that makes it confusing.  They openly admit they dont want the book to be rated on the quality of the english.  Just as well, long rambling thaughts that don't form conclusions.  Not what I wanted or needed.  It actually manages to take the fun out of reading and texas holdem all in one go
I bought the C. Crane FM transmitter expecting to broadcast from my computer and listen to it on an FM tuner with headsets as I worked around the house and yard.  It broadcast 5 or 6 feet, max, out of the box.  I performed the power boosting "fix" and now it broadcasts 10-20 feet, if I'm lucky, before static overpowers the signal.  This was a disappointing purchase directly from C. Crane that in no way met my expectations.  If it requires setting the transmitter on a grounded metal plate and lengthening the antenna in order to bring transmission up to whole house and yard capabilities, build it that way from the get-go or state the limitations of this transmitter forthrightly. ---  --- I kept the transmitter because I wanted one for the car.  It's physically well built and works fine for that.  I also use it to play my Ipod through a radio...but, understand, the radio is sitting right next to the transmitter.   ---  --- If you want to transmit throughout your house and yard, look elsewhere
Let's face it. Nothing anyone says can sway a particular fragment of this movie's viewing audience one way or the other. Those who love J.Lo will declare the greathess of this movie, in a variety of ways.  Those who hate J.Lo will counter their every point in describing how bad it is. And those who love quality film won't waste too much time even recognizing that this movie even exists. Guilty pleasure, indeed! One thing you have to admit about J.Lo, she's consistent. She sings bad, acts bad, and is merely eye candy, for thoe who find her appealing. And this movie is full of all of the above, plus awful, cliche ridden, emotionally pleading writing that should be an inspiration to anyone with Hollywood writing aspirations, since this movie demonstrates how little talent it takes. At least it's had it's short, but sill way too long presence on the premium movie channels, cause for a while this piece of garbage was ubiquitous, just like the lead starlett. Maniupulative only begins to describe this drek. But that said, it's more than enough time wasted on this movie. I merely felt compelled to warn folks. Don't waste your time. It stinks
Having previously owned battery powered travel razors, I was always disappointed with their power and battery life. After all, what's the point ditching a heavier charger and razor if you have to carry a load of extra batteries and still end up stubbly faced? The Braun 370-BK was a pleasant surprise, however; powerful enough to hack through my hiking stubble and plenty of juice for an extended outing. I also liked the folding design which protects the cutting surfaces and keeps the cleaning brush from getting lost. A great piece of tech at a good price
I got this product when the price dropped down to $12. So for that price I liked this product a lot. It heats the lotion well. Initially I thought it was small, but now I think it is the correct size. I did not realize how much better it is to apply heated lotion until this. I switch it on when I go for a bath and by the time I am back, the lotion is ready and warm. It is a great buy, and for all you bargain shoppers, wait till the price drops. It is  especially a great buy during winter
I was pretty excited about this player, having read about it in Runners' World. There are a lot of problems with it, however. While it is advertised as a sports MP3 player, in a lot of respects it isn't very convenient for someone who buys it for sports. My issues are: --- - Headphones are not at all appropriate for sports, particularly running.. they keep falling off, so I had to invest in a better pair of headphones. Kind of weird since it's supposed to be a sports player. Also, I spent at least five minutes everytime untangling them before I could use them. --- - Hard to change music while running, and it often ends up doing something I don't want it to. You can't change the music without removing the MP3 player from the armband, which is a major pain and is just a function of bad design that you can't tell from any picture. --- - Not easy to figure out the features of the player, such as the stopwatch, pedometer. Also hard to use once you do figure it out. --- - Software is a pain to use. --- - Organization of songs is annoying and difficult to maneuever on player. ---  --- That being said, I still use it. There are some good features: --- - Long battery life, recharges super quick --- - Very cool-looking player --- - Very easy to carry around.. can slip it a pocket or a bag of any size.  ---  --- I would not recommend this player and if given a choice, I would not buy it again.
Will someone PLEASE produce a DVD/VHS re-make of DIVA with the excellent sound quality deserving of this film!? I was so excited to finally find this movie, but quickly realized after reading reviews from fellow fans, that it would be a disappointment and waste of my money to purchase it. I hope the word gets back to whoever reproduced this movie and they'll re-issue a quality DVD and/or video soon
They get the job done, but the handles are a little thin and can get uncomfortable during the last couple of set
I owned this as an LP and played it over and over on my tiny, mono phonograph.  I loved it then and I love it now. Rainmaker, I'm On My Way Back Home and Love Is All That I Ever Needed would all have been sucessful singles. I Would Have Loved You Anyway is the only song I don't really like but the lyrics are unintentionally funny. All the lyrics seem more suggestive now than they did then but that's ok! The background singers get a tad tiring but Go David Cassidy! I don't care if it's the memories or not, I enjoy putting this on and turning it up
Another torrent of mild tripe from everyone's "favourite" DJ, Tiesto.   --- What on earth is he going to do when the supply of inane, pastel-coloured eurovomit dance music runs out? --- When I think about the number of times I've heard him touted as "World's Number One Best Voted DJ" or "DJ Mag Top 100 Finalist", you'd start to think that the man can actually mix records, when in fact rather than mix them, he tends to grind them together roughly into a nightmarish aural paste then reconfigure them violently in new, unusual and horrendously nauseating forms.  I can absolutely confirm this. I have had the startling and displeasing experience of witnessing it live.   --- The sad truth of the matter is, that there are any number of drug-addicted fluoro-pants-wearing 16 year old ravers out there, and all are quite willing to buy boring rubbish like this.  Or at least all are prepared to ask their mum and dad to buy it for them for xmas. --- I sign off in disgust
My husband and I finished off a bottle of wine before assembling the unit. : ) It only took us an hour and a half to assemble, and our kids were running around like a couple of nuts during the process. After we finished the assembly, we both took a turn on a preset program. The machine is extremely sturdy, quiet, and worked like a charm - just like a unit found at a gym. We're extremely pleased with our purchase and would recommend it to anyone
A friend brought me a large bottle back from his trip to Mexico.  I threw out all the other store bought vanilla bottles I had.  They do not compare to this one.  It has a strong, rich flavor.  I add to it everything I can.  My chocolate chip cookies and french toast could not be complete without Molina Vanilla
I go to Anime expos alot. And to to be honest this sword aint half bad. Unlike its 67' brother its only 37' but its a whole lot better to wield. Combat Ready, Very Sturdy and made in CHINA. I notice some swords made in PAKISTAN! and they usually end up breaking so this swords worth the buy if your a bleach fan and if you wanna save some cash
We bought this for our 8 year old son for Christmas. He absolutely LOVES It! It goes just fast enough and is well designed for a comfortable ride. Brakes work very well. Riders need to start off slow and get a feel for the turn radius. Given the chopper style, long nose...quick tight corners usually mean you are in for a fall.  --- I suggest getting a motorcycle style riding helmet for safety. --- Easy to put together... a no brainer. --- Well worth the cost.  --- He told us he loves feeling the wind in his face, shirt sleeves flapping...I think we have started something I may not want to deal with as he gets older. Future Harley riders look out! --- 
A little outdated, quite a few beers here aren't made anymore. Beer reviews are always personal opinion, and you'll read a bunch of people complain in these reviews that this guy doesn't know what hes talking about. I'd ignore what they say, everybody has their own preference. --- Think about this before you buy this book: --- 1) Why do you need to hear what somebody else things of beers? --- 2) its very out dated... 5 years is a long time
I bought four of these and all of them broke within the first or second use, making them completely unusable.
It didnt work as good as the teflon curling iron i had a couple years ago, it works just as good as a regular non-teflon curling iron
I've been playing NCAA 2007 for a few weeks now, and here are my thoughts: --- 1) The game simply does as good a job at capturing the feeling of it's sport as any other game.  Anyone who has been to a big-time SEC game understands that the stadium does shake. --- 2) I did not play the "career" mode, I simply prefer control over the whole program. --- 3) Gameplay is very strong, anyone who has played NCAA or Madden in the past will notice the tightening up of the controls. --- 4) I personally do not like the first person camera on special teams plays, it makes it frustratingly difficult to return kicks. --- 5) Likewise I could do without the auto slo-motion on "key" plays.  It absolutely destroys the flow of the play to highlight a catch or hit during the play.  EA, that's what replay is for. --- 6) The system is annoyingly apt to hit me with unsportsmanlike conduct penalties, not just on TD's but simple catches or defensive plays. --- 7)You now have more control over recruiting with in-season recruiting, including mulitple pitches and on-campus visits. --- 8)After all these versions can EA come up with a new set of unlockables.  Changing the logo, or the sponsor(!) does not a new unlockable make
This record is one of the best that has found its way out since the new millenium. I am partial to good songwriting and Bill's particular folk-country-alt-emotive sound. The tracks to me all over the place and take it from someone who has been there and back -it was well worth the trip
Has the effect of thousends $$$$ watch. I love it. One of the best deals i`ve had from Amazon this last years
I tried to like this product.  As previous reviews have said it has significant design limitations.  If you only need a 2D floorplan there are better tools for the same money or less.  The object libraries that come with the tool - furniture, fabrics, etc. - are really lame.  This limits it's value as an interior design tool.  I did not attempt to return it so I cannot comment on their return policy
After reading the reviews on this table we thought we would gamble. We were very disappointed.  The packaging arrived torn and open in several places. Only a few screws came with the table, not that this made much difference as there were table parts missing too. The parts that did arrive were chipped practically in every corner and the paint rubbed off. Amazon were efficient in having the item picked up for return and refund
He was exelente, but I continue insisting deveria to at least place a paguina with translation to the Spanish on the item.  Thus they tendrian but trade here in Venezuela,   --- without but one takes leave of you     ---  Emerson.
I purchased this product thinking that it will be better than the hand held models or the scale type models, since it combines measurements from hands and feet for a more accurate measurement of body fat.  The scale part works normal, but the Body Fat measurement is higher by 20 - 30%, compared to Tanita BC554 scale or Omron HBF-306C hand held.  Omron, replaced the unit, but the new one is also inaccurate.  Now, I'm tying to get my money refunded, but Omron does not want to take the unit back
I agree with the last reader.  I didn't finish this book, it was SO boring.  NOTHING happened.  And the characters were annoying.  I read a lot of books that aren't action-oriented and like them.  But this one was  awful
I rate this piece of equipment as 4 stars because I have not used it enough to know if it does everything it claims....however I have been amazed at how this little contraption does wonders on my back.  ---  --- When I first got this lumbar extender I set up up in about 2 seconds and then stretched backwards to lay on it. OMG, as I laid down it was like I couldn't even breath for a brief second. To actually feel my back being forced into shape nearly took my breath away as all the muscles were pushed around. I had to relax and it was amazing how sore the muscles in my back were from leaning over my computer at work.  ---  --- Having used it for about a month now, my back has started to feel much better and I am sleeping better too
Mill states here that he still believes traditional gender roles (as we now call them) are desirable, but, being John Mill, he passionatly believes in the freedom of lifestyle choice for the individual.  Hard to argue with that
i was gonna make a point, but fabz made it for me  i was gonna say that nowadays an cd is considered tight just because it has a couple of hit singles  and Yayo's hit singles werent really hits  his songs were on the radio & tv for probably about a month or two  if thats what you call a hit then you crazy  the fact is it takes more than 4 good songs to make a good cd  he said that there were 4 hot songs on the album but failed to mention that there are 17 SONGS on the cd   a couple of good songs dont make it good cd  you want to see what other people think of the Yayo album read the reviews for it  and jeezy  please  he always been garbag
I'm a HUGE fan of Christopher Lawrence's stuff, but I aboslutely refuse to buy this CD because of the copy protection.  I do not pirate music, and should be allowed to copy music I purchase onto my MP3 player of choice.  This is just sad
I love Canon products and I have had a complete Canon system for about 10 years.   I love everything Canon does.  However I do not understand Canon's reasoning behind producing this lens. ---  --- The reason for the EF-S lenses is offering wider angle by getting the rear elements of a lens closer to the "film" plane.  They cannot do this on film and full frame sensor cameras because the mirror is larger and would hit the rear elements of an EF-S lens. ---  --- They have indicated, however, that by 35 mm that advantage is gone.   Why then do they produce a 60 mm Macro lens when they already have their macro requirements covered with they current three lenses?   I would guess that the short back focus makes the lens cheaper; but this lens is only $60 short of the excellent 100 f2.8 USM Macro. ---  --- As I said, if for $60 I can get a lens that has 40 mm more reach (66 in 1.6crop cameras; useful in macro photography) and that works on ALL CANON CAMERAS, I'm not going to be thinking about this lens at all. ---  --- Granted, you might not be thinking of buying a FF camera anytime soon, but Canon has indicated that eventually they will have FF on all their DSLR's, so why bother with this lens? ---  --- The 17-85 or 10-22 are very reasonable offerings for the EF-S lineup, but the 60mm macro doesn't make any sense to me. ---  --- my $0.0
I purchased this item judging by its comfort factor. All's well except the buckles do not have pins to hold the straps in place. The straps slip off occassionally, causing the shoes to come loose.
Had great expectations, for the expensive subscription you get some really great coverage of neat hardware hacking stuff happening out there (and available on the web). The how to make stuff takes many many unnecessary pages, get the feel that they are trying to fill the pages with large photo spreads. Still has a way to go before it becomes a successful combination of Wired magazine, Elektor electronics, and hardware hack websites. Would definitely like more stuff like making an XYZ mill/router instead of a feature on the MIT fab lab. In spite of all the above I have renewed the pricey subscription - am still hoping ...
This powder is great. It has great coverage without looking cakey. I also have sensitive skin and this has never bothered me. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it's still a little dark for very light skin and it needs to be "touched-up" a little more often than other powders I've tried, but it's worth it
This tea is comforting when feeling ill or under-the-weather.  Also it has a pleasant taste.  I highly recommend it
As an IT professional I would strongly recommend against installing Norton 360 on your computer.  I have been a big fan of Norton Security for years and I have it installed on all my home computers for years.  After installing Norton 360, it erased most of my security settings and my computer continiusly crashed.  It messed up on of my home computers to the point that not only it would crash several times a day, but I couldn't even use System Restore to recover my computer and I was forced to rebuild the system from scratch. ---  --- Don't believe the promise to install it easily on 3 computers either.  Symantec makes as difficult as possible for you to download the software and isntall it. ---  --- I am ready to switch to McAfee
My 7 year old son received the Giga Ball for Christmas. It was a big hit. He and all of his cousins had a great time with it for several hours. Unfortunately, the very next day, it pretty much fell apart. I didn't expect it would last very long, but had hoped that it would last more than one day
Mario and Luigi Partners in Time to me takes me back to the SNES, with the first Mario RPG "Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars" a game I absolutely love (and would also recommend to anyone with an SNES or an emulator). The reason is the general gameplay for this RPG hasn't changed. You move around different screens, attack the enemies, fight bosses, etc. There is definately a unique (and I suppose you might consider it simplistic) ideology that this game follows. It's an easier version of action/RPGs, you level up, battles aren't random (you can see the enemies you engage on screen) though it is turn-based. This game plays and feels much like the original legend of the seven stars, but has added its own twists and funny little story line to make it, it's own game. ---  --- I highly recommend this game to anyone who doesn't mind a lot of chatting, but even more action and puzzles! Another homerun for Mario RPGs
I purchased these as a Christmas gift for my daughter.  They take way too long to heat up and the clips leave a crimp mark in her hair.  For the money I don't think they were worth it
Just got this in the mail:  If I allow SI to charge my credit card NOW for a subscription that isn't due to renew until 12/24/2007, they will send me 60 issues for $39.00, or .65 per issue.  I have the right to discontinue this automatic billing at any time.  So there is a very slight savings, somewhat offset by the fact that they will use my $$$ for an extra 9 months or so (recognizing that at the typical bank interest rate of 2%, that interest is worth about 50 cents, so I guess it pushes the per issue rate up to .66)
This is a nice looking watch overall. If you like this style in Black, look for the T233XLTMN.  It is a very very nice watch, and popular in Europe.
The music here frequently reminded me of Pagan's Mind with a touch of Porcupine Tree and flashes of Iron Maiden.  A fantastic mixture of 1970s Progressive rock bands such as Yes and Kansas molded with European-style Power Metal and Brazilian folk music.  While this can be extremely interesting there are a few moments here and there that don't quite mesh.  In actuality I give the CD 4.5 stars for its superb songcraft and inspired, sometimes flawed ambition.  But as an overall package, this Special Edition of "Temple of Shadows" is an excellent place for newcomers as the bonus DVD holds a concert in 5.1 surround sound that is loaded with songs from their back catalog.  This is a great album filled with high quality Progressive Power Metal and a DVD concert that gives a taste of their other albums (not to mention it's just plain fun to watch as the band members are clearly enjoying themselves, smiling throughout the show).  Highly recommended.
Playboy magazine, while luring people to open the cover with promises of female flesh, consistently has excellent articles focusing on issues of civil rights, civil liberties, and the defense of them all.  Trancending partisanship, Playboy is a beacon of stewardship over the rights we all take for granted daily. --- And the pictures are nice
wonderful game a true challange for any die hard friends fan two big thumbs up!!!!
Inis has become my favourite perfume, every time I wear it I am always being asked "What perfume are you wearing?" It is light, fresh & fragrant, not overpowering but makes an impression. I have tried lots of perfumes but none compare to Inis. The fact it is not tested on animals is a bonus and also it is not too expensive. Can't recommend it enough. Buy and try
I sent this to my in-laws foy Christmas and they LOVED it!! They recently added a backyard garden and they are thrilled to have it and love how it looks. I am told it is quite comfortable as well
This is one of a series of horror anthology movies released by Amicus Studios in the early 70's.  (i.e. "Tales From the Crypt", "The House That Dripped Blood", "Vault of Horror").Each anthology is held together by a certain theme.   ---  --- In "Asylum" a young psychiatrist interviewing for a job in an asylum is told that the head of the asylum has gone crazy and is now a patient.  The young psychiatrist must hear the stories of some of the patients and then determine who was the head of the Asylum.  If he is correct, he gets the job.  ---  --- The stories give the feel of old horror comics, which inspired many horror anthologies. The characters are one-dimensional and driven by such deadly sins, as greed and lust. In most cases,  with a twist and a touch of macabre, the fates get their revenge on the evil-doers. ---  --- The stories are mostly enjoyable and solid entries in the horror anthology genre. The British countryside, where the stories are mostly set, adds an extra chill.  ---  --- The movie is recommended most to fans of horror anthologies, such as HBO's "Tales From the Crypt" or Stephen King's "Creepshow", and the movies noted earlier.  It would also be great for those who remember how much fun these movies were when they first came out.  ---  --- More general audiences would be entertained, but I don't think this movie should be ranked with 5-Star horror masterpieces ("The Exorcist", "Halloween", "Psycho"), nor would I expect most general audiences to rank it so highly.    ---  --- The DVD quality is definitely noteworthy, having sharp, rich colors which enhanced the movie's experience.
I received the lens adapter but there was no info on how to use it. It screws in over the regular ZOOM lens but offers absolutely nothing to the use of the KODAK DX6490. I suspect there are additional filters or other accessories that might make the adapter useful and hope to find out what they may be in the near future. The lens adapter by itself, doesn't seem to add anything to the use of the camera without something else ??? --- Ben Boykin, Las Cruces, NM 8801
Come one people, Windows Vista is not only as unstable as it's Windows predecesors with a very uglu memory management and a really unsecure and ineffective hard drive and files management; I've lost lots of very important files due to Windows "errors" that shut down applications and even the PC itself, so i decided my self: TO USE LINUX OR TO DIE WITH MICROSOFT !, and i'm still alive ! ;-) ---  --- As i told you, Vista is nothing more but a cheap copy of visual effects that Linux users had from several years from now; in facto, right now i'm using a Linux version called Sabayon and it is a million light years away from Windows Vista, it's visual effects are simply incredible (try searching "Beryl" in youtube for you to know what i'm talking aboyt), i have not only 3D windows, but 3D Desktops, incredible effects to minimize and maximize and a veeeery looooong list of features that you have to see it for yourself to beleave it. ---  --- I know that you might be concerned for several aspects at this points that wooried me in time (when i was evaluating Windows Vs Linux): --- 1.- My Documents, that will happen with them?. Nothing will happen, in fact you'll ba able to open them and modify them as you please, the OppenOffice suite is totally compatibble with your Microsoft Documents. --- 2.- My programs?, well there are several options to run Windows programs in Linux, as "cedega", "wine", etc etc etc, si it means that you will be able to run most of the windows programs in Linux. --- 3.- Is it hard to use ?. No way !, it's as easy to use as Windows, you will only have to dedicate a few time (may be a couple of hours) to understand several conceps as the multiple destops, the file system, and the users and permission management (that is the one of the most secures in the world) (Microsoft Windows cant's say that!). ---  --- So, if you don't beleave search google for sabayon and youtube for beryl and you will open your eyes!. ---  --- So... think about spending this 400 bucks twice, because Sabayon and other versions as Ubuntu, Kubuntu, some versions of SUSE, and other Linux distributions are TOTALY FREE of charge!. you only have to download them and burn it to a CD or DVD, whatever you like.

This game is fun- you get to pick a race car and run amok among cities.  You can even go the wrong way.  For me (older adult) it was fun to play with my kids, but I found it repetitive and boring after a while.  Of course my kids love the gamecube and really like this game
I purchased the Rino 130 specifically because it also had the  radio and NOAA features.  Fortunately I read the other reviews on this model as well as the 120 and 110 versions that complained about poor radio performance. I tested the unit and sure enough the radio performance is absolutely terrible, and I was able to return the unit to Amazon in time for a full refund.  Be sure to test this yourself.  Also the buttons are very small, and the zoom function is impractical as you constantly have to activate the zoom and then slide the zoom level up and down.  I returned the Rino 130 and purchased a Garmin Etrex Legend C (color display) for about the same price.  I will miss the NOAA feature of the 130 but not the radio.  This is an overpriced GPS.  Spend the money on a color display unit instead and you will not be disappointed
This is simply the best remote you will ever need for all your infarad remotes!  I have a Chinese satallite receiver that I could never get it to work with all other "universal" remotes.  I was able to teach this remote to work with it!  This is a small computer
The product was delivered in a timely manner and functions properly
The thing you are likely to use most is the nail clipper. But it is very blunt!!! And the special cover on the clipper makes cutting the nails impossible, unless baby's nail is very very long. If I wait until the nails are long enough to cut by this thing, my 3-month-old would have scratched his face and head. I end up buying a new baby nail clipper with a big handle and magnifying glass from nearby pharmacy. That worked much better.
Any manufacturer that doesn't fully label their product should not be trusted. I do not see a list of ingredients here (but most nail polishes don't bother to do this anyway). The problem I see is this...this nail polish totes that it's safe to use during pregnancy due to the fact that it doesn't contain the above ingredients, but what DOES it contain instead? If it wears well, doesn't peel, give good color coverage, it's got to contain something in the offending ingredient's place, logically.  ---  --- Please ask yourself this before you sigh relief and Add to Basket! Phthalates, for example, are a class of industrial plasticizers that were invented in the 1930s. They are often used in nail polish because they make nail polish flexible, and they are used in other products because they help bleed the chemicals of fragrances and help lotion better penetrate the skin. They aren't required to be labeled on the products. Lab animals given dibutyl phthalate had higher numbers of offspring with birth defects, especially of the male reproductive system. A nail polish may not contain phthalates (and brag about it), but may contain a related plasticizer that essentially is just as harmful. Does this contain phthalic anhydride, a toxic chemical hardener? How about FD&C color, such as Yellow 5? It's a petroleum-based color that is also questionable when it comes to safety.  ---  --- Basically put, no nail polish is safe during pregnancy. On top of that, while your at it you should review every lotion, foundation product, etc that you use if you're concerned about things like this. I think it's great to be careful - more power to you - but be fully informed, not partially. Companies prey on our worst fears, and what is worse than harming our babies? If this product is so great, let's see an ingredients list (and all cosmetics should do the same, while I'm sounding off on the subject!) 
I have had an early version of this watch for 17 years, and when it malfunctioned, I decided it was time to get a new one.  The previous watch had been repaired 2 times earlier, and unfortunately every time I got it back from COSERV, it would be less and less accurate, thus I decide to get a new one.  The new one was made in Maylasia vs Japan (I have read on this site that one needs to be concerned about that), and was lighter in weight, but kept time well for about one week.  I bumped the watch on a table (nothing severe, the previous watch endured much more) and it immediately started gaining more than 10 minutes per hour.  I had high hopes that this watch would at least meet, and hopely exceed the durability of the previous watch, but it did not make it passed one week of casual wear.  I returned it in disappointment
And so does Gadget Dad and Gadget Kids. ---  --- Not only is it an affordable piece of equipment, but it's great for the whole family. ---  --- Having twin boys age 13 and a husband and I who all added a few pounds of winter wool over the last few months, we really needed something that was going to fit nicely into our busy lives.  This does just that! ---  --- I'll admit, I was a bit upset when I found that Gadget Dad had ordered it because I was the normal skeptic, but it's been well worth the investment and then some
Works well. Driver installation is somewhat tricky becuase it is not obvious which driver among all on cd you have to install. No synchronization software is included so you have to use a third-party tool like bitpim. Which is ok
When I first played this game, I got bored in 10 minutes.All you do is shoot and kill people for nothing, have the police chase you and you shoot them, Bring girls into your car and do it with them. I dont recommend this game at all its overrated
I did read all the reviews and was afraid something bad could happen during delivery. My fears proved wrong. I received a heavy package not damage, with all contents inside. The bike is working well and it is really a great exercise bike
Crashed the system every time I tried to use it...   gave me such a headache I tossed it in the trash...
A very good product. For traveling people with GPRS Internet access.  The charger is good when you are away of power. --- The MPT version is Ok but more value is for seem editing (for professional and expert users only)
I bought this dvd after reading all the great reviews and I was VERY disappointed. First off, it is outdated and that is annoying with the annoying music- but the background exercisers really bug me too. Not only that, the moves are strange. She does a lot of shoulder work moving back and forth with her feet to the beat of the cheesy music. I found my neck hurt A LOT after that. The leg section would be good if there was another way to position yourself. The ab section too was so old school, I was hoping to find some new exercises. I love Karen Voight but this dvd was definately the worst I have yet to purchase of hers. All the other Karen Voight I own I absolutely love
I was happy at first when I got this memory card but when my phone crashed the memory card was completely wiped out.  I was ok with the memory card getting wiped out but when I tried re-formatting the card my phone, computer and laptop couldnt even read the card so I ended up throwing it away.  I guess You really get what you pay for
Some will mistake me for a Evidence hater, but I'm really not.  I just want the man to put some effort into what he does.  I'm tired of taking just any ol' thing artists throw at us nowadays because the "fans" don't expect very much -- or simply don't know what good is anymore.  Sure, you can relate to what Evidence is saying, but you can put on a dope instrumental CD, sit with a friend or knowledgable hip hop head, have a discussion about any topic, and the resulting feeling will be something like the feeling you get from this album.  I quickly get tired of the "slow flow" -- see: talking -- and I feel like anyone can do it.  I don't shell out money for things I can do myself.  Really, the only difference between him and 50 cent is content.  When I hear someone say "slow flow" my mind translates that into "reduction of standards to make it easier for cats to get on" because this album would have been thrown out the window before the jiggy invasion came.  And lot of these beats, though very dope, are as slow as his flow is.  Couple that with the fact that there are a lot of wack guest appearance from cats like Joe Scudda (I'm sorry, I tried to like him, but dude is simply terrible), Big Pooh (same goes for him), and Madchild and you have an album that can have a drowsying effect on the listener.  The only dope guest shots come from Phonte, Planet Asia, and Slug.  Yeah, I know the fans and jock riders will hate and call names, but I'm going to keep it honest -- fu** real. ---  --- When Ev actually puts his back into it, he creates some dope material.  "Down With New York City" is nice piece of work that has Ev gettin' busy over an air tight Jake One track.  "Chase The Clouds Away" is another track where Ev does his thing over a pounding ALC production.  The standout to me had to be "Line of Scrimmage" which features Ev and Atmosphere frontman, Slug, getting nice over another dope ALC creation.  With the likes of Alchemist, Sid Roams, Jake One, DJ Khalil, Babu, and Evidence himself providing dope beats, I'd have to say that the production is definitely the strong point of the LP. ---  --- Simply put, I don't recommend playing this CD while operating heavy machinery.  I respect Ev and his whole crew (hell, I love Rakaa), but this album will make you nod off instead of nod to the beat.  I can only call it the way I see it regardless of whether or not the artist is a favorite of mine or not.  Bring on the unhelpful votes if you want, but I can only recommend this to the die hard fans -- who should eat this one up.

The first time we set the arbor up we found the top would not fit over the frame.  Two parts pulled off the top trying to get it to fit.  The seller forwarded the photos and complaint to Texsport and they sent us another top.  When we put that top on we found the same thing.  That is when we found the frame was 4" longer than the top.  There were seams that were not sewn properly and there was a hook missing on one corner.  After cutting the poles down we were able to get the thing put together.  When next spring comes we will replace this one and I can assure you it will not be a Texsport product
Want a sure fire way to kill your party??  Put this DVD in, turn the music off, make people sit down and play this game.  It was not fast, it was not frightening, it was not fun. Your guests would have more fun watching the paint dry in your basement

Having just read the book (most highly recommended) I decided to treat myself to the movie. I could have cried. While I did not expect the movie to contain everything from the book, I was sadly dissapointed to see that it totally changed the plot around. --- In the book, the 5 men bonded together and were great men of character. In the movie, they got rid of one man, had the other eaten right off the bat, Pencroft is shown to be a coward and greedy. In the book, Nemo appears only in the last two or three chapters, and he does not have an elaborate home on the island. --- And what about those stupid giant animals? I don't recall reading about them. The fence around Nemo's home looks like it came right from Jurassic Park. ---  --- The whole story was about 5 (eventually 6) men who were stranded on an uncharted island and the wonderful adventures they had there.  ---  --- On another note, the graphics were pretty bad. The panning was very blurry and the picture was often grainy. ---  --- As one reviewer well said, it is suitable for children who are easily pleased, but it is nothing like the book. ---  --- Perhaps this is why Amazon sells it for only $6.99
You may as well pitch the instructions because they're worthless (and the only reason I'm not giving a 5-star rating for the ADS Tech Video Xpress).  I was about ready to pitch the product as well, after losing two evenings trying to figure out how to get it to work.  Ultimately, I gave up on relying solely on the program it came with, and I instead opted to try it on my Windows Movie Maker.  Yahoo!  Perseverance paid off!  Once I switched to Movie Maker, this tool worked great!   ---  --- To date, I've converted about a dozen videos of content to computer files that I was able to burn to DVDs.  I just leave my Xpress hooked up to the back of my television so I don't have to try to remember later how to hook it up again.  Doing that, I can connect my laptop to the Xpress and start the video converting process within 3-4 minutes.  My Movie Maker program takes over the entire process.   ---  --- The ADS Tech Video Xpress has been especially useful for me because I teach a college telecourse and often show edited video clips to my students.  Before purchasing Xpress, I had crudely edited videos that I was reluctant to use; my videos had lots of amateur stop/start points.  Using Movie Maker with Xpress, I was able to download these videos to my laptop, then easily edit them so transitions between stop and start points became smooth and seamless.   ---  --- Pretty cool.  I'm glad I took a chance on this product! ---  --- Below are hook-up and program instructions I've written to myself for easy reference later.  Hopefully they'll be of more help to you than the instructions that come with this product: ---  --- First, hook up the Video Xpress equipment as follows: --- 1.  S-cable (buy one, since it doesn't come with the VideoXpress) goes from the back of your television to the VideoXpress.   --- 2.  Use red/white/yellow cords running into the back of the VCR/DVD that is hooked up to your televion as follows: --- - all three plug into the "video out" column --- - all three plug into the VideoXpress tool at the other end.   --- 3.  The USB plug for the VideoXpress tool plugs into the back of the computer. ---  --- Next, open the Instant Video Xpress program and verify the settings are as follows: --- - "NTSC M" for the video standard setting --- - "640 x 480" and "60 FPS (VGA)" for video format --- - "DVD, VCR, TV" for video source --- - "Video composite" for video input ---  --- Under the program advanced settings: --- - Low motion (TV, VCD, DVD) --- - CPU support: "SSE3" --- - Stereo system: "MTS" --- - Video decoder: "video standard: NTSC_M" ---  --- Under properties within the program advanced settings: --- - Stream format:  Video format: "NTSC_M" --- - Frame rate: "59.940" --- - Color space/compression: "YUY2" --- - Outputs size: "640x480" ---  --- Finally, CLOSE the Instant Video Xpress program.  (Windows Movie Maker can't access the video until this program is closed.  And yes, it's silly to have to open it, make those setting changes, then close it, but Video Xpress won't work correctly unless you follow those setting steps.) ---  --- In case you need this information for Windows Movie Maker, the steps (in order) are as follows: --- Under "File," click on "capture video." ---  --- Use the following settings: --- - audio device set at: "USB2.0 Analog Audio Device" --- - Video input source set at: "Composite" --- Under Configure Video Capture Device: --- - Video format: Video standard: "NTSC_M" ---      Frame rate: "29.970" ---      Color space/compression: "YUY2" ---      Output size: "640x480" ---  --- Under Camera settings: --- - Deinterlace method: "Low motion (TV, VCD, DVD)" --- - CPU support: "SSE3" --- - Stereosystem: "MTS" ---  --- Under Video decoder: Video standard: "MTSC_M" --- Signal detected: "1" --- Lines detected: "525" --- Then... ---  --- Give the file a name and indicate where to save it ---  --- Set it for "best quality" for playback. ---  --- Then "Start Capture." ---  --- If the Video Xpress is hooked up and running correctly, you should see on your computer monitor the video image of whatever is showing on television, but you will NOT hear the sound.  When you finish capturing and play it back, THEN you'll hear the sound. ---  --- I know, I know -- clear as mud.  But hey, it's better than the Xpress instructions!  :-
I would reccomend this film to any Robert Johnson fan as well as to anyone just getting into the blues who wants to know where its really at. It includes some great interviews with Johnny Shines, Robert jr Lockwood and others who knew Robert. Its worth it just to hear Lockwood play an unrecorded song of R.J.'s! The parts where Keb' Mo' re-enacts segments from R.J.'s life are well done and effectively illustrate what life would have been like back then for a traveling bluesman. My only criticism would be that there are few extra DVD features,however, that doesn't stop me watching this film again and again! A very informative insight into the life of one of the greatest Delta bluesmen
We bought this product based on its testimonials and thought it would be the best choice for our new baby. While he had no problems using the Playtex Nursers, he ended up having a problem with Dr. brown's Natural Flow bottles. First off, they are a pain to clean. Each piece needs to be painstakenly washed (boiling the nipple, washing the bottle, and scrubbing each hole of the the insert and the reservoir.) It was certainly laborsome and time consuming. Anyhow, when he uses them, he spits up where he didn't with the competition. I tried to figure out why. If you tip the bottle over it drips constantly without any sucking. So my baby is not sucking or swallowing when he uses this product. He lets it build up in his mouth and then ends up having to push it out when he has gotten too much. Needless to say, we are planning to return these and will stick with Playtex
These binoculars provide a good tool for night time --- sky viewing.  Easier to carry than a telescope with --- the advantage of using both eyes.  The tripod mount --- can be used with most any tripod with a standard screw mount. --- The 15 power makes hand holding a challenge but with practice --- they work great.
Although the compartments seem small, you can fit lots of food into this bowl. It's divided into about 4 or 5 sections, so you can separate your veggies, meat, etc. The only thing that bummed me out was the ice pack - the frozen gel expanded on the inside and caused the container to break :( So, I use it to store food in the fridge. I have all of the other Fit & Fresh containers and none of the ice packs on those have broken.
They don't make films like this today.  It's a scathing, smart, funny, and thought-provoking look at TV news.  But more importantly, it's a great film about complicated people and their relationships
Judas Preist's 1974 debut album. ---  ---  --- This is simpley weird, i could see why the band hates this album so much...simpley becuase it is so uneven and utterly sloppy and the production sounds like they recorded it in BFI dumpster. When i first got this, i was like "What the Hell?", granted, debut albums are far from perfect, but this was just downright miserable. This sounds like a combination of Pink Floyd,Rush,Black Sabbath and Cream on an acid trip. The song ROCKA ROLLA was OK and so was ONE FOR THE ROAD, but the rest of the material was abismal. SAD WINGS OF DESTINY was such an improvment from this mess! The coolest thing about this album is the weird scrapping guitar effects Tipton makes on one of the songs! I'm surprised that this was even issued on a CD, the band doesn't even acknowlege the existance of this album and i can see why! Fortuanatly they prooved to be so much more then what this platter of stange noises provided us with. I know that there are some that like this, but not me! It is very blues based in some songs, and the most annoying thing is that some of these numbers will put you to sleep. Any one expecting a rocking metal album from the Preist will be let down by this
Thinking this jacket was made of fleece like material, i ordered it thinking it was a good buy. When i got it in the mail, a week later, i was soooooooooo disappointed. The material is like paper/ potato sack material... Its awful.. Like plastic...  I dont recommend u waste [...] on this .. The jacket is stylish no doubt... but the material not something u'd actually wear.. So a stylish jacket with bad material describes this jacket best. [...
When I found out Francis Collins has written a book about his faith, I ordered it the same day.  After all, we seemed to be following the same path.  I earned a PhD in Molecular Biology in 1981 and had several `firsts' in the area of gene cloning.  Then I found Christ as a 40-year-old.  My transition was from a semi-serious Jew to a Materialist to a serious Christian.  Hearing about Dr. Collins' spiritual walk had me intrigued. ---  --- His book should be entitled "a Politician Presents Evidence for Belief".  It is a completely uncritical view of the last twenty years of biological research.  The Human Genome Project is elevated to status of "bridge to a momentous new era".  Hogwash.  Hype is the term I would use.  The Dept. of Energy was duped into footing the bill because the National Institutes of Health saw it as a waste of resources.  The author couldn't make a better case for the payoff than to show humans have more `junk DNA' than previously thought. ---  --- Dr. Collins then explained Darwinian gradualism as if it were dogma.  This oversimplification is typical of those who never studied Biology except at a Medical School.  This is not entirely his fault, however, since many scientific journals will not publish research where evolution isn't perfectly gradual and perfectly random.  Their motivation should be perfectly obvious, but it's not even on Dr. Collins' radar.  He also uses Mendel's peas as a pivotal point in our understanding of genetics, assuming the reader would be ignorant that Mendel's data was `dry-labbed'. ---  --- Usually an author who writes on this subject is strong in either Biology or Theology.  Dr. Collins relies on two sources for his treatise on Theology: St. Augustine and  C.S. Lewis.  I happen to agree with him that the Creation Story and the books of Job and Song of Solomon have a "lyrical and allegorical flavor".  I would include the Book of Jonah in that category as well.  However, there is an entire literature on the subject that is completely overlooked. ---  --- The only time Dr. Collins makes a strong case for anything, it is to refute Edward O Wilson, Richard Dawkins, and their minions.  Even then, he uses a quote from the late Stephen Jay Gould for his most scathing criticism.  Francis Collins is the consummate politician--he takes a stand without offending anyone.   ---  --- Dr. Collins knows that Jesus was not a politician, and He did not worry about offending the intellectual elites of his time. Take this quote from Mat 23:14 "Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation."  Dr. Collins' book claims to be a middle ground for theists and scientists.  In my opinion it is a  piece of fluff and a narcissistic retelling of the Human Genome Project myth.
i doubt i could have made it through the first three months without this product.  my daughter had undiagnosed acid reflux and this was recommended as a help.  (after she was diagnosed, we were given zantac... but still used this as well!)  it's a true godsend.  we'd add a dropperful to her formula and presto - she was content!!!  this works far better than mylicon.  it is expensive - but it is completely worth the price.  we called it 'liquid gold' in our house
Installed this on my 2006 Civic EX Sedan to replace the pathetic (meep...meep!) sounding factory horn. The factory horn made me shrink in embarassment everytime I used it. Well, no more - this Bad Boy made the receiving end to shrink now...lol.
Why doesn't Amazon allow people to sell *used* lettuce? I bought "To Kill a Mockingbird" used last week via amazon and saved about 90% off the original price. I don't think it's fair that they are not allowing us to sell it used via Paypal.
This is my third child and third infant car seat.  This was the most expensive, but worth the money.  The padding keeps the baby's head from that scary 90 degree flop; the shoulder straps have padding which prevents the red marks the others left on my kids; the straps don't get twisted and it's much easier to get in and out of the car.  It's the same weight as the others (which is to say rather heavy and awkward to carry).  The only thing I don't like is it does not fit on shopping carts.  Worth the money
LOVE these!  These are a great treat at any age.  I bagged the giant cola bottles, giant crocs and gummy bears in a treat bag for my 4th grade students.  They were savoring the giant cola bottles.  I don't blame them.  I find myself chomping on them, too.  I don't even like coca cola
the middle back pocket broke within the first week we used the item. and were unable to fix the problem
These individually wrapped Slim Jims make great snacks for hungry kids.  Toss a few in your purse and you have a portable, filling treat while you're out with the kids.  My kids love them and ask for them over fruit snacks or candy
I wasn't pleased with this book. I've read all of Ms. Warren's E-Books and I have to say they have a lot more fire. She lost a lot in this book.  Somewhere around the middle of the book, I started thinking "Did I actually buy a book this bad."  --- Because I enjoyed her e books so much I didn't stop to think before purchasing it. I was so happy to have her book, I immediately called a friend who also drove to the book store to purchase the book.  Boy, Did I get it from her the next day.  --- Because we don't believe in throwing money away, We're still stuggling to finish the book. Hopefully, there is light at the end of the tunnel.
I guess I understand why this movie was so savagely criticized during it's year of release, 1986.  Prince was still enjoying huge popularity based largely on the success of "Purple Rain," both the film and the soundtrack.  And critics love to knock someone off a pedestal, which is what they did to Prince in those days.  Many claimed that the movie was nothing more than an ego trip.  They couldn't believe Prince had the nerve to fire the director and then assume that role himself.  It was all way too harsh criticism for a movie that isn't trying to be anything more than a fun romantic comedy.  ---  --- Of course, poor critical response alone doesn't usually keep the public from making a movie popular.  Yet "Under the Cherry Moon" was a bomb at he box office.  Probably the main reason for this is that the movie, although shot in color, was released in black-and-white.  For some unfathomable reason, the general movie-going public is more often than not horrified at the prospect of seeing a black-and-white movie.  Now don't get me wrong, I'm not claiming that had the movie been released in color that people would have flocked to it in droves.  I'm only saying that it would have attracted more of an audience if it had been in color.  I will acknowledge that this movie's target audience is Prince fans.  Since I am one myself, and have been most of my life, I'm not the most entirely objective viewer. ---  --- But I make no apologies for my love of this movie.  It's not a "guilty pleasure" for me, because I proudly hold this as one of my favorites.  I had only seen it a couple times before the DVD release - and unfotunately I missed it in theaters (I couldn't get anyone to take me, I was only 12 and none of my friends were into P and certainly not my parents - though my dad went with me a few years later to see "Grafitti Bridge" on opening night, but that's for another review).  But since it's DVD release in 2004, this has become one of my most-watched discs in my collection. ---  --- The soundtrack is KILLER, the tunes make up one of the best Prince albums ever.  There's even some great stuff heard in the movie that didn't make the album (some of which was issued on 12" vinyl).  Plus, I think the movie looks great - the cinematographer was Michael Ballhaus, who has multiple Academy Award nominations to his credit (and was the DP on numerous Martin Scorsese classics).  I wonder how the movie would feel in color, but I do think black-and-white was the right way to go.  Even though the movie is set in then-contemporary times, it has the feel of something from the '30s.   ---  --- There are so many classic moments in this movie, I won't try to list them all.  But here are a few... Christopher Tracy (Prince) giving his "Bela Lugosi eyes"...Tricky (Jerome Benton) tossing rose petals into the tub while Christopher takes a bath...Christopher freaking out when he sees bats at the eatery...the "Wreka Stow" scene...the car race between Christopher and Mary Sharon (Kristen Scott Thomas). ---  --- As for the acting, I've heard a lot of people saying that Prince's performance was no good.  I don't see much truth in that claim.  After being so serious in "Purple Rain," it was a nice contrast to see him so loose and funny in this.  Jerome Benton proved he could do just fine even without Morris Day at his side (as in "Purple Rain") - I'm surprised Jerome hasn't done much additional acting outside of Prince movies.  And obviously Kristen Scott Thomas moved on from this, her first major role, to become an Oscar-nominated, highly repected leading lady.   ---  --- How is the DVD presentation?  Pretty good, for such a largely overlooked movie.  The widescreen transfer and 2.0 stereo mix aren't anything phenomenal, but get the job done nonetheless; the movie looks and sounds fine.  As for features, anyone expecting a full-blown Special Edition like the 2-disc "Purple Rain" will be disappointed.  But at least it's not a completely bare-bones release - four music videos are included, though unfortunately not presented in optimal audio/visual quality (though they are passable, I would've preferred 5.1 mixes).  The highlight is the live performance of "anotherlover" which was taken from a never-released (at least not domestically, not sure if it saw the light of day anywhere outside the U.S.) concert video documenting the Parade tour.   ---  --- MTV held an interesting (i.e.- very weird) contest to determine where "Under the Cherry Moon" would have it's world premiere.  The ten-thousandth caller to an MTV hotline would accompany Prince to the premiere, which would be held in their hometown.  MTV ran a special that covered the premiere party - and unlike the premiere of "Purple Rain" unfortunately this program is not to be found on "Under the Cherry Moon"'s DVD release.  Lisa Barber was the contest winner, and the movie did indeed premiere in her hometown of Sheridan, Wyoming - a very unusual place for a big movie to premiere.  When asked what he thought of the town of Sheridan, Prince summed it up with a single word: "Purple."
I have used these for years, and when I run out, my skin knows and shows the difference.  I have super sensitive skin that tends to become red and itchy when exposed to any kind of change in weather....cold or hot.  I carry these in my purse, and have them stashed all over the house....misting my face many times a day....voila....clear and moisterized skin!  They really do work wonders on sensitive facial skin, and they keep mine from being red and itchy, which makes me very happy
Keeping this smoker up to temperature had been a chore until I invested in a heavy duty 25 foot extension cord. I bought a 12 gage  15 amp 25 foot chord and I'm now actually using the thermostat to back off the temperature. ---  --- I got this cord at Lowes and it cost around $18 dollars. The manual  says to use a 50 foot or less cord with your smoker..but it makes sense to use as short of a cord as you can. ---  --- Also..thanks for the tip from a previous reviewer about drilling a hole at the bottom of the smoker to allow the excess water to drain out.   ---  --- Got to go my Ribs are almost done.   
You win some and you lose some. This purchase was a definite loss. What a dissapointment
I was really impressed by the taste of this cereal. I was expecting the flavor to be like cardboard or something like this, but instead it was really good. It was sweet (but not sugar sweet) and crunchy. I'll definitely buy this again. If the price went down I'd buy it more
I'm very pleased with this tea.   ---  --- I boil a pot of water and then take the lid off and let it cool to the right temperature, which is around 200 degrees Fahrenheit.  I let it steep for about five minutes and then remove my infuser and pour myself a cuppa nice, light oolong.  It's good and relaxing. ---  --- Arrived in the container seen in the picture, with the tea sealed up in a little plastic bag inside of it.  I'd recommend it
I'm very disappointed with this shredder. I got it back in October 2006, and I have only used it about 3 or 4 times.  First of all, although the product is supposed to shred up to 5 sheets at a time - IT DOES NOT. It will get jammed, so I only shred 1 or 2 sheets at a time. Tonight I used it again, and it became completely jammed from a few sheets. I cannot get it to work again.  It is very loud and a bit slow, but I can live with that, I just don't like the fact that it jams after only using it a few times. I recommend others spend a few extra dollars and get a reliable shredder, unlike the Royal "5-sheet" Crosscut Shredder HT500x
This game is really great. I would recommend this game to anyone. It's a great game to play with the family or by yourself. I have had this game for awhile now and have finished it about 2 times. The first time i've finished it, it was kinda challenging on the last level, but when I went over it again I zipped right threw it. This game doesn't get you bored at all you'll be into it right from the beginning of the game. I like how you can choose whoever you want during the game. The graphics well they aren't as great as the movie. But overall it's awesome. I will play it over and over again. It's great!!!!!!!!!!!
When I first got this watch I was thrilled.  It has a nice movement and has very powerful illumination.  The problem started when I went to the store to get the bracelet sized for my puny wrists.  The guy asked me if this was some kind of overstock or gray market, because the pins in the bracelet popped out like nothing.  At the time I thought he was just po'd because I didnt buy the watch at the store.  As soon as I was home though the bracelet fell apart.  What a piece of junk!  I regret buying this watch and I advise against it. 
This game is so much fun!!! I do think that maybe it could use a few more games or maybe make different difficulty levels. In other words... If you are a huge Star Wars fan like me, then you will love this game!!! It will keep you occupied for at least an hour a day if you are determined to beat a certain level. Another thing I think it could use is maybe a game-save function or something... Anyway, GREAT GAMING EXPERIENCE!!! One and a half thumbs up!!!
I didn't see the other reviews until after my copy arrived. Having now wasted a weekend reading this book, I have to agree with everyone. The topic sounds great, the book isn't
I just bought my first laptop computer and really, really hated the touchpad. I found it unresponsive at times and found the whole right clicking and using the pad at the same time a pain. ---  --- I spent a while browsing the different mice available on this and other sites and in the end decided upon this little number. ---  --- I am very happy that I did too. Its pretty small and very lightweight but at the same time it doesnt feel at all fragile - definately well made. Im about 5'11 and have fairly big hands - I find this mouse comfortable to use. It looks pretty cool too, the red panels on the side light up, which is always good for night work. All the buttons are very responsive and that middle button is a godsend after using the touchpad for the past month. I couldnt ask for better all round performance. And for $20 you really cant go wrong, it really is a great price for a microsoft mouse. The only reason I dont give it five stars?? Well this is technology - although it is a awesome piece of kit, there are always other things or features they could have added
This album is a real let down and it pains me to say so, since I really do like the KOL. The first 2 cds were catchy and they rocked. I didn't care if they were singing about groupie sex or street brawling. It didn't matter because the songs were great.But on this cd they've opted for an experimental sound that doesn't measure up. Innovative is one thing but that shrill screech in Charmer-what the heck is up with that? How often do you want to listen to it? Once was enough for me. I wasn't expecting the Pixies here. And then there's the reverb employed on song after song-why? It just degenerates into white noise. There are a couple of good tracks on the dics- Black Thumbnail, for one. But then there are throwaway tunes like Camaro, which is about as clique as you can get. That said, art is subjective, and there are obviously plenty of folks who feel compelled to give this cd glowing reviews. But I find most of it unlistenable.I can think of many cds that merit a 5 star rating; this is definitely not one of them
The product came promptly and I am happy with the quality.  However fitment wasn't perfect as the ends would sit a little higher than my treo.  Not a huge problem, but something I would feel everytime I reach for the stylus. But the pen works pretty good, and it feels sturdy in my hands.  I would definately recomment this product to others
I finally found out this was out on DVD after having the VHS version for many years.  The DVD edit is very close to the VHS version minus the glitch during the scorpions opening act, plus some video strobing added during Cindy Lauper's run down the runway, which I'm not sure was really needed, but I'm ok with it, although the video strobing was done again later, which seems to me as a cheap effect, that really doesn't add to the performance. ---  --- I think Brian Adams and Cindy was excellent for the parts they portraid.  I thought originally sinaed (sp? whatever) was a strange choice at the time, maybe good for the part, but after seeing the documentary, I see her being a good intention decision at the time that ended up biting them in the end.  She's too instable, and apparently did not realize the importance of such an event, nor did she show any respect for the part.  Speaking of which, all of those artists that were called to perform at this event, and didn't say Yes on the first call.... shame on you.  If Roger calls you for an event, you say YES, and put whatever you're doing aside, because this was way too big of an event to try to be politically correct with. ---  --- I wish there were more documentary material with this DVD, as this was such a big event, there should have been more information.  I had heard in an interview before the show that Roger was once asked if he'd ever do the wall again, and he basically said "If the berlin wall would ever come down, then I would consider doing it again", and this was never mentioned in the Doc. ---  --- Buy the video, even if you have the VHS, you'll enjoy it. ---  --- ... Still waiting for Pulse to be released as well, enjoy!
This movie certainly had some strong actors and actresses in it and that with an interesting storyline landed it on my viewing list. ---  --- Overall, I was somewhat disappointed with this film.  I figured there would be a little more real suspense or "thrill" but it never materialized and instead just followed many of the usual plot events.  The biggest failure was the completely unneccessary cheesey romance between Eastwood and Russo. It was contrived, lame, and almost laughable. I had to rub my eyes to make sure I wasnt having a nightmare! ---  --- John Malkovich does a great job as the wackjob and is totally convincing in this role.  Unfortunately the script didnt do him enough justice and even his character did some staple moves.  Clint Eastwood was great as always but he did play his usual self. No problem here though, Clint was solid. ---  --- The film just fizzled as it went along and it started to get tiresome towards the very end.  The climax was rather anti-climactic except for the shooting scene which was kind of cool although I saw it coming a mile away.  There was not as much suspense as I was hoping for and the "thrill" was mostly missing. ---  --- What else can I say, watch it and make your own decision but overall I was not that impressed and the film let me down a bit after such glowing reviews
I bought the entire line of products from the Lisa's Hair Regimen on the Carol's daughter website. I took all the products back to Sephora yesterday. I used this Hair oil on my scalp and the next day my scalp started itching. I washed it that night and woke up the next morning in serious pain. I wear my hair natural and I had what felt like chemical burns all over my scalp. When I took the product back to Sephora the lady who sold it to me told me my scalp was RED w/ white spots all throughout it. I had to take OTC pain medication twice a day for three days just to help me sleep at night due to the pain. The only thing I can attribute it to is an allergic reaction. The product contain extracts from different types of plant and flowers. If you have allergies to these items I would suggest not using this product. I contacted Carol's Daughter and have not heard back from them yet. I would have expected more from the company who's product states 'Made with Love, Peace'.
I usually don't do album reviews but I gotta say this was tight from beginning to end and I was shook that this was given a low reading by a magazine I call "The Sauce" So many of yall need to stop reading magazine ratings and come to sites likes this and read your own peers ratings.  Word of mouth is bliss. A-G-2-A-KE who came out on Rap-A-Lot hasn't come out with a cd since this classic.  I'm salty they didn't "make it" because this was heavily slept on
My hsuband and and decided that I would nurse Hailey her entire first year.  I work at a school and was able to pump twice a day.  I didn't like doing it in school though because there wasn't space for it.  SO I would go in my car and do it.  All I had a first was the battery pack.  I would go through 10 batteries a week and half way through the week I would loose strength/suction. ---  --- Once I got the adapter I never had a problem again.  We could go anywhere and I would always have access to power Including when we drove from VA to GA.  My husband would drive and I would pump.  It is great..
I bought this model 7 years ago for over $100 and it is still running strong although I only use it to clip a small family dog.  Nevertheless, forget the cheap vibrating 'magnetic motor' clippers - not enough power and the buzzing bothers the animal.  This clipper uses a superior rotating motor that is more powerful and provides a consistent cutting action.  In fact, with the right (replaceable) blade, you could use this to cut kids hair as well.  It stays cool, unlike the magnetic motor design.  Use with Oster Kool Lube and you  will never have problems getting a clean cut.  It uses blades by Oster so there is a lot of versatility possible
I got this for my wife to use in the kitchen and she loves it.  The unit is beautifully designed, fun to use and has amazing sound for something so small.  My only gripe is that the tuner is not very strong.  I live in a tough area for reception, and there's slight static on my favorite stations.  The FM antenna attachment that comes with the unit helps quite a bit, but the reception is still not totally clear. ---  --- That being said, I'm glad I got it, and when my wife's happy, I'm happy
Very unreliable .......... I have used DVD RW and CD RW Memorex disks on multiple computers and DVD recorders.  I find that they.....1) don't last....get about 50 re-recordings NOT 1500  2) may crap out on any occasion.......multiple CD RW's with critical material would NOT read on multiple computers. ---  --- AVOID MEMOREX DVD RW &  CD RW DISKS!
It does everything promised but takes several hours of going over the instructions to figure out how to program some of the features.  Instructions hard to locate in booklet
The magazine has great, quality pictures and some interesting articles.   ---  --- The pictures of some golf courses are amazing and very professional. ---  --- I love reading this magazine in my spare time.  Yes, the magazine is for golfers who always tended to have higher incomes.  Golf  was always an expensive sport anyway. ---  --- For golf instructions, I recommmend                          THE ULIMATE GOLF INSTRUCTION GUIDE: KEY TECHNIQUES FOR BECOMING A ZERO HANDICAP GOLFER OR BETTER.  This is written by Patrick Leonardi ---  --- I wanted to share with other readers because this book made my golf game get much better.  If you are like me, I was stuck around the same handicap.  However, this book got me playing much better golf. ---  --- For golf equipment, I definitely recommmend PING IRONS.  Great feel and distance with these clubs.  For putters, I also recommend PING.  They are the best.  The ball putts straight and true.   The feel is natural and unforced.
I used Aveeno moisturizer and thought I would try something new.  I have eczema on my face (around my eyes, nose and mouth) in the winter and have no signs of it after a few days.  My skin is very sensitive, and have experienced burning with other products, but not this one.  I sinks in quickly and is not greasy feeling or heavy, yet strong enough to tackle dry skin.  I highly recommend it
I just bought this game and tried for 3 hours to make it work on 3 different t.v. sets - NO LUCK.  I can't even give it 1 star because I don't know how fun it is (or might be).  I tried every "input" available on every t.v., I tried changing the batteries, I tried hooking it directly to the t.v. as well as thru the VCR and DVD player - nothing worked.  I guess I know why it only cost $5.99.
I so love the size and shape of this camera. This one takes some good pictures, and appear to be quite clear. It's better than the integrated camera on my cell phone. This camera may seem like it's taken a poor quality image, but when you transfer them onto a pc, they seem so clear! However it is recommended that you get a memory card for this camera as it only has 14mb of internal memory. As this camera was a gift to me, I'd have to say it was the best birthday present I have received
I din't love these at all.  The flavor combinations struck me as off, there was no improvement in the pistachio taste by adding harissa. Also the texture was unpleasant, somewhat soggy.  I like the healthy aspect, but if you aren't enjoying the experience why eat at all
   --- Is there anything more American then apple pie, baseball or a good Rock Hudson/Doris Day Film? It's always been such a treat to curl up with them and the third essential player, Tony Randall. Rock is always doing something to infuriate Doris. He's her worst nightmare. And what's more, he pretends to be someone else that Doris falls for head over heals until the gig is up. Then she's out for revenge, but love always wins out. Ahhhh such feel good, laugh out loud stuff. ---   --- So in this one from 1961 "Lover Come Back", Madison Ave is the setting. Advertising is the game of Carol Templeton and rival Jerry Webster. But Jerry is such a cad and a playboy. He steals big clients right from under her by wining and dining them, throwing raucous parties and getting the girl for them. Carol on the other hand, does things a little different. She's virtuous and business like. When he trumps her cards once too often, she plans to get a little underhanded herself. Trying to win over the scientist that is going to invent a new product for our guy Rock, Doris, who has never met Webster(as is always the case), mistakes him for...you guessed it..the shy, retiring, needy nerdy scientist. Jerry, in true form goes along with it, and tries to woo Carol into his bed. And the fun continues... ---   --- Doris is marvelous. Watch her face. So many different emotions she goes through. From being Exasperated, to being in love, she does it all. She's simply a joy. Rock matches her perfectly with his pretenses, and has a way with the dialogue that just says Rock!  As mentioned Tony Randall is always the third part to the equation that makes these films such classic fun. Here he is the President of the ad firm and Jerry's boss, but hasn't a clue as to what's going on. He does this quite well.Meanwhile, the fun doesn't end with Doris and Rock. The race to make a new product, VIP! is causing quite a few explosions and when the product is finally ready for testing...well you just have to see for yourself! ---  --- The rest of the cast is quite a roll call. Ann B Davis, Delbert Mann, Donna Douglas(the beautiful Ellie Mae Clampett), Edie Adams, Jack Albertson, Jack Oakie, Joe Flynn, Richard Deacon,wow... the list goes on. --- The transfer to DVD looks great. Picture clear, colors good.The film is presented in Anamorphic widescreen 1.85:1 The sound is in Dol Dig 2.0(MONO), but this isn't an action flick, so it's fine.There are caption in English(a nod to Universal there), subtitles in Spanish and French. There are no features of any kind other than scene selections. ---  --- This film is a treasure from the 60's vault. Doris' outfits alone are smashing, and NYC in the 60's too. This film has no rating on the case, but I would say PG. There are some adult situations, but all done in tasteful fun(can you imagine Doris Day, doing anything else, even if she tried?).The other two films that this trio delight us with is "Pillow Talk" and "Send Me No Flowers" ---  --- Well, I'm off to watch another Day/Hudson/Randall film. I've got my bowl of VIP and ready for a fun evening.....Lauri
My son loves this game! We rented it first from Blockbuster and now he won't let us take it back, so I ordered it from Amazon.com so I can take the game back soon to Blockbuster! I have to help him through some of the areas, like when the penguin is fishing, but I don't mind because it's FUN
I explected the microdermabrasion head to rotate, but instead it vibrates very strongly in your hand.  My hands are still buzzing from the night before when I used this product. ---  --- I would not recommend this product to anyone else, I loved the crystals cream.
It arrived in 3 days and I used it for a week, and I still get some stray ingrowns once in a while but it is the only thing that worked this good this fast for me and trust me I tried everything in the book. ---  --- A plus is my face is one even complexion when I had alot of dark spots which was a pleasant surprise
 --- I've spent all day putting together a 300 page book in Corel Draw, the file was saved several times without error, the finished piece is 2.6 GB. I exported it as a PDF that is 4.5 GB. Never any errors in Corel Draw.  ---  --- Acrobat won't open the PDF. Says it's corrupted. ---  --- Now when I open the CDR all I get is a single page, and when I right click on the file and look at the properties it says it's 0 pages. ---  --- I'm really upset, and now I've wasted an entire day with COREL's software, if the thing is just for 1 or 2 page church brochures COREL should WARN people on the package. ---  --- It looks like I'm SOL and I'm guessing Corel will never bother with a reply. ---  --- Hint: I think I'll switch to Adobe. ---  --- Sincerely, ---  --- Waitman Gobbl
I was required to purchase this with my new computer. I thought I'd give it a chance at work. We have a dedicated wired network, which just requires that you register the machine's MAC address with our DHCP server. Nice and simple, and very much like the LAN in any home where the user has a NAT router. ---  --- I plugged in the network and tried to get the MAC address. Vista would only give me the wizard to connect my network. OK, I tried the wizard. It offers to let me setup PPPoE with a username and password. That's it, no other options. I asked for other options, and it only offered that I use a modem (that I did not have in my computer.) No options for a dedicated network at all, that I could find. ---  --- I went to another machine (on the 'net) and searched Google. None of the Microsoft sites were helpful in any way. Lots of PR posturing, but no useful information or troubleshooting. ---  --- I gave up, found the license and install disks for Windows XP, and downgraded the new machine. It was far, far easier.
I recieved the headphones this week and hooked them up to my fast tracker and went out into the yard looking for treasure. They work great and I was very pleased with the quality of the product and the sound.If you have a fast track metal detector you need to purchase this accessory it is made to adapt to all bounty fast track models.  The Vinma
The markers are dark and clearly visible, while the eraser is fairly thorough. The box comes with a plastic-molded container (as you see in the picture), with double-sided tape for easy, stable, mounting on a wall beside the whiteboard. For the low price, this is unbeatable
Some products lead to real improvement of your skin (retin A, exfoliators) while others simply cover up the imperfections acting like a make up. The sad and hillarious thing is that most consumers mix up makeup effects with real skin improvement. ---  --- The Regenerist contains SILICONES that fill in small wrinkles and mattify the skin surface thus acting like an invisible makeup. Such effects lead most consumers to believe their crow's feet are smaller. If you really want to do a test, you should stop using the product for a few days using only face wash. If during that time you observe smaller wrinkles then the product works. You can't really claim the wrinkles are smaller while the product is on your face covering them hello.... --- And another thing, a wrinkle can't be erased in one or 3 weeks - the skin doesn't produce collagen that fast (unless you cut it). ---  --- Paying $18 / 1.7 oz (retail price, its cheaper on amazon but you have to pay shipping price) for a silicone makeup is a little steep for me provided that there are cheaper products on the market that will make your skin look equally good cause they contain the same silicone base even better -  try Monistat soothing care - chafing relief powder gel 1.5 OZ, $7 at CVS.  ---  --- I have been using Matrixyl(the active peptide in Regenerist) for 6 months in my own formulations (without silicones) and frankly speaking haven't noticed any improvement in my crows feet or the lines on my forehead. Currently there is only one study of the effects of Matrixyl conducted by Sederma - the MANIFACTURER of Matrixyl which makes me quite suspicious about the whole story ...
A quality product. Low to the ground so very hard for a little one to tip over. Easy to assemble. Can't wait for the snow to disappear so we can take it outside! Have been riding it inside, mostly using our legs (we're not yet 2 yrs old) to scoot around. However, our bigger cousin (just turned 5 yrs old) had a blast with it and could still peddle without grinding his knees into the handle bars. This trike will last a long time and thru many kids
There are so many reviews saying this is a true story I have to point out that while the war and the deployment were real (obviously), about everything else is dramatized (including the mission objectives: SCUD hunting on foot, which is a joke to anyone who knows how wars are fought today). McNab has essentially written Tom Clancy genre fiction. The book Bravo Two Zero differs in details with another book written by a second member of the patrol, Chris Ryan, called The One That Got Away. However, both are convincingly debunked by a third SAS memeber in a book called The Real Bravo Two Zero, also available on Amazon, though only the UK Amazon site (which you can still order from in the US). In it, an SAS member who can actually speak Arabic retraces the patrol using both books as guides and talks to all the people McNab and Ryan supposedly killed and gets their side of the story. Most importantly, he manages to restore, without a doubt, the reputation of Vince Phillips, blamed by Ryan for getting the patrol discovered by the Iraqis and a couple members eventually killed. Contrary to what you may expect, I would recommend seeing this, in fact I recommend getting and comparing all three books: B20, The One That Got Away, and The Real B20
I just read the other reviewer's comments.  Yes, the bag isn't huge, but it certainly gets the job done.  It's not the over-sized bag where you can stuff 6 full sized textbooks, but it's a bag that has style.  That's why I got it.  It's a bit more european in its design, and is of good quality.  I dont expect zippers to break anytime soon.  Look to be good quality.  Also, at this price--it is such a good deal
i first bought this product because the woman at the store said that it renewed the skin, bringing newer skin to the surface.  and she added that it helps pull pimples out to the surface so you can get rid of them easier, i was a little wary a first, but it works.  my skin feels softer and looks more even all around.
This one is excellent for the price. Good build and accurate.  --- I wish it had alert function
The item is so much cheaper than the alternative,which is $200.  It was easy to use and easy to store when not in use
You will probably be more productive and less bug ridden if you stick with what you have. --- 15 years of Outlook and you can't print a single address label or an envelope with one click. (or 10 clicks for that matter) --- There is no function to easily print out mailing labels either.  --- Lets remember Outlook is a Contact manager ... next to many other things...  ---  --- Maybe Outlook 2010 will be the answer. --- 
We've used this since our baby was born three months ago.  It has a the perfect combination of space for baby accessories as well as your own. It has two small external pockets for extra bottles and a large inside pouch where we keep most of the diapers and larger gear (as well as inside compartments). It also has a small cell phone pocket outside which we use.  The bag is excellent quality and not so large as to be awkward to carry around.  Our baby is still too small to use the convertible sling but I have seen it used on older children. ---  --- We'll be getting these as gifts for our friends who are expecting
I love this stuff!! Five months ago I was diagnosed with having AK's (Actinic Keratosis -- lesions that can develop into squamous cell carcinoma/ skin cancer). My dermatologist recommended I use Skinceuticals CE Ferulic every day as it prevents thymine dimers (DNA mutations associated with skin cancer) with a medium exfoliator for a few months before taking more drastic measures to eradicate the AK's. My skin has never been healthier!! The lesions (which were scaly, itchy, and red) are healed and the overall apperance of my skin has improved dramatically and is much more even. My pores are smaller and I have a healthy glow. The CE Ferulic also is packed with antioxidant protection to help fight free-radical damage and provides photoprotection.  --- HIGHLY recommended for those with AK's, uneven skin tone, large pores, or blemished or dull skin.  --- LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!
Doom 3 is scary. you literally spend most of the game in the dark and nightmarish creatures can come out of nowhere and try to kill you. The environments look great and so does the character models. The game is long but can be longer if you get lost. However, this game has a few flaws. One (and it's a big one) is that you have to always carry the flashlight around. because most FPS only have the character have one weapon on one hand at a time and have the other hand to be non-existent, you constently have to switch between the flashlight and a weapon. So when it's dark and you have to fight, you have to either hold a flashlight and keep whacking your opponent until it's dead or stay in the dark and shoot your enemy which you can have a hard time finding it. the second con is that (unlike Half Life 2) you can't really interact with much. you can't grab certain objects and drop them or throw them. And a final con, which comes to one word: Imps. these are the most annoying enemy in the game. you constently fight them and it can get annoying sometimes. otherwise, a game to get
I after drooling over this watch for two years wishing I had one, I finally got one and have had my Advizor for two months now.  All I can say is that if I had known how cool this thing really was, I would have shelled out the $300 a long time ago. Each one of the features listed above does everything you could want. The Heart Rate Monitor has target zone settings, average workout heart rate, highest and lowest hear rate, and more. The Altimeter tells your rate of ascent, total vertical climb and stores all the data from recent workouts in memory. The coolest feature is that it will store your heart rate, altitude and rate of ascent/decent at intervals from 20 seconds to ten minutes so that after a workout you can scroll though and see how your heart rate was affected by altitude and acent rate. I got completely geeky with this information after one workout, and I typed it all into my computer so I could see what it looked like. The only drawback to the Advizor is that it gives you so much information, it would be great if you could download it directly to a computer for analysis. There is no PC link, so any analysis has to be done on the watch or typed in by hand. But other than that, this gizmo is perfect. No problems at all so far and I use the thing for two workouts a day.  I am a cross country ski racer and for a long time I had thought that this would be the perfect training aid for endurance athletes and now that I have tried it I know that it is
I hesitate to write a review about a food because, well, one man's meat is another man's poison ...  I like the not-too-sweet and minimally processed taste of this brand; the Banana flavour is our favourite.  The Fruit and Nut flavour lacks a little oomph and the fruit inside is too tangy for my taste buds (so maybe TOO minimally processed?).  Also, remember that 'All Natural' is NOT organic, even if you find this in the health food section of your grocery store.  Our local Target also carries this brand of granola and has the best price for it
I am a previous Britax owner. I purchased the Britax Roundabout for my daughter when she was 4 months. At 18 months she was only 5 inches from outgrowing it. Since we had such a plesant experience with the roundabout we decided to stay with the Britax brand and purchase the Marathon in the Olivia print. I was very dissapointed. --- I had a major issue with the straps comming loose while we were driving. When we would get to our destination the straps were so loose there was virtually nothing holding her into her seat. A huge scare for any parent at the thought of what could happen when you slam on your brakes. It also lacked the supurb comfort that britax boasts of. My daughter was never as comfortable in the marathon as she was in her roundabout. The rubber things that go over the straps were also incredibly annoying. The constantly slid down out of place and by the end of the trip the chest clip was in my childs lap. That coupled with the straps comming loose were defentially not expected of britax high saftey standards. I went through quite the fiaso returning this seat and after 3 returns I bought the Eddie Bauer seat instead. So far I have no complaints. I wouldn't waste my money on this. Buy the roundabout if you want Britax name, but please dont bother with this Marathon
I bought this dress for a trip I'm taking in one week. Should've known better. You get what you pay for, that's for sure. This dress arrived balled up in a USPS bag. It didn't look anything like the picture shown on this site, more like a slip, than a slip dress. And here's the kicker - it was RIPPED! Had two large "snags" on the back of the dress. I'm sending it back and they BETTER not try to charge me shipping. I'm PO'd to the max and who knows if I'll find a dress in time. Grrrr
didn't like these.  infact theyre so ugly i havent even tried them o
I'm glad someone knows enough about English History to recognize the pure fiction of this film.  But in addition to points made about historical inaccuracy, I also had to object to the ridiculous portrayal of Mary Tudor.  Over-zealous and fanatic (as was a common religious stance in those times - promoted by both sides of the Protestant/Catholic conflict), she was not insane as the film makes her in the opening scenes.  And throughout the film, there was this emphasis on milking the passions for all they are worth - no objectivity whatsoever.  I was sorely disappointed! ---  --- If you want to get to know Elizabeth and the period in which she lived, I would recommend the superb BBC series, Elizabeth R with Glenda Jackson.  And if you want even further background, look to the BBC again in the Six Wives of Henry VIII with Keith Mitchell.  Tidbits can be gained as well from the movie Mary, Queen of Scots (although a few historical inaccuracies can be found in it - for example, Mary Stuart and Elizabeth never met, although it was Mary's great desire) and even another title, Anne of the Thousand Days.  Those two more theatrical representations fulfill the desire for the more dramatic while still coming closer to the history of the times.  This film just doesn't cut it
I bought this camera just under 12 months ago and recently the battery cover door would not stay closed.  I sent it into Nikon along with my proof of purchase and about a week later got a letter saying it would not be covered under warranty. The repair charge with shipping and tax would be $115.22. ---  --- I am the only person that uses this camera and it was never dropped or abused.  Battery was only taken in and out maybe 4 or 6 times over the time I had it.  ---  --- For this reason I would never buy another Nikon product again.  Next digital camera will charge without removing battery.   ---  --- Camera takes GREAT pictures, but can't do business with a firm that is very difficult to get ahold of and does not honor their warranty.  ---  --- Bye Bye Nikon
Clinique's Bare Brilliance is one of my absolute favorite lipsticks ever! --- It has a fairly sheer finish with lovely little sparkles in it.  I have Berrylicious(sheer grape) and Cherry Quartz(sheer, true red--doesn't look like it does on the color swatch) and neither overwhelms my pale skin.  I wouldn't be caught dead without a Bare Brilliance lipstick in my makeup bag or purse!
Accurate, easy to program and good to look at.  Well worth the $ spent
This is a very nice sleek cover and gives your phone a great feel and look
I've been buying these freeze dried strawberries for several months and use them mainly in my cereal. They are delicious and consistantly high quality. I have only had one can with what seemed like excessive strawberry "powder" at the bottom.
This product is a good idea however: ---  --- 1. The fill hole, is not large enough to fill the bottom of the dish       ---    with hot tap water without getting water into the serving tray. ---  --- 2. Can't be put in the Micro. ---  --- 3. Extremely hard to open bottom compartment to clean. ---  --- 4. Extremely hard to open and close ( I and my daughter have to use a  ---    butter knife to pry open). ---  --- 5. Not good for a grandmother's hands that has joint problems. ---  --- 6. Doesn't keep food warm for very long. ---  --- Perhaps going back to the drawing board would help this product
If you want to see Lena Heady's breasts exposed, this is the film to watch.  But besides the numerous unnecessary topless scenes (which aren't too bad) this film is very intriguing...the human spirit tries to break through walls of addiction, frustration and isolation... now isn't that what a "suspense" drama should be about
We own a home with vaulted ceilings and we have tried everything to keep the house clean (cobwebs, ceiling fans, windows,etc.) that are out of reach.  We found this product online and it works great.  Our kids even enjoy using it around the house.  Each attachment is perfect for the task at hand.  I wish we bought it five years ago. 
Saveur is a celebration of authentic cuisine with everything from Food Festivals to very easy-to-make recipes, like Blueberry Pudding. While there are a few book reviews for foodies to enjoy, the writing introduces cooks to international flavors and seasonal fare. Restaurants are also a feature as are gourmet cooking essentials.  ---  --- While reading you may discover a pastry shop or start to dream of making a recipe like Chicken Fried Steak. Yes, this very gourmet book has comfort food recipes as well as more complex recipes like the one for Olive Bread which actually only requires a minimum of bread making skills.  ---  --- After reading this magazine I'm normally in the mood to drizzle olive oil over just about anything I'm putting in the oven. The recipe for Stuffed Tomatoes and Summer Squash had me wishing it was October again and the recipe for Fig Jam reminded me of my childhood in Africa where we had a Fig Tree in the backyard.  ---  --- Saveur is filled with nostalgia, entertaining food adventures and delicious recipes. With Amazon's Gourmet food section, we can now find the ingredients to make many of the recipes in this magazine.  ---  --- ~The Rebecca Review 
And I am not just talking about weight loss products.  I took one pill....ONE PILL!  Within a few minutes, I was curled up around the toilet crying because I needed to throw up so badly but I couldn't.  I hadn't drunk anything but one glass of water with it, and yet, I was peeing all day.  I was nauseus....my fiancee stayed home with me all day to take care of me.  I didn't want to move, but I would have to go to the bathroom to pee, and would carry around a trash can with me just in case I finally could throw up.  I would not wish these symptoms on ANYONE, not even my worst enemy.  That was probably the worst sickness I have ever had
Not only is "We Love Katamari" way better then the first, but you get to play the prince's cousins. Some of the cousins are faster, some are slower & some seem stronger then others. Also some of the Katamari's have earth elements such as a big snowball Katamari & a fireball one too. The fireball is kind of tricky, you have to keep the fire on it burning, if not the level fails, also watch out for the water, it will put it out, no matter how big it is. Last but not least to finish "We Love Katamari", you need to convert your progress from "Katamari Damacy" to this one. If you did delete the first one from you memory card, then to bad, you'll have to play the first all over again.    
Well this is marketed as a quick and healthy snack for kids, but I find it perfect for me.  It's a great charge of chocolate and not too many calories and bit of fiber, what more can you ask for
I have an original thighmaster I purchased years ago...thinking this Thighmaster Gold was going to be similar I purchased it to take to work with me.  It is very flimsy-it seems to be made of very light weight material that is not going to hold up. My old thighmaster is very sturdy-I have been using it for years and it looks fairly new.  This one will be ready for the trash can in less than a year.  Save your money
 the battery is half the side of the battery came with the camera an last half the time, an number or not the same ,an it,s not the same battery. do not buy any thing from them because lying about what they are selling
The Spy Who Came In From The Cold gets inside your veins like cold, bullying ice and by the end of the movie you feel numb.  Based on the famous novel by John Le Carre, director Martin Ritt seems determined to reveal the ugly reality of espionage (on both sides of the Iron Curtain) as it really was.   ---  --- Alec Leamas, the haunted British spy for the U.S. has nothing to do with James Bond.  Richard Burton gives such a phenomenal performance as this rancid, cranky, solitary alcoholic (he wasn't entirely acting) that one can't help but wonder why he didnt get the Oscar for Best Performance that year.  Leamas is, in his own words, "just a bloody man", tired of all the ideologies on both sides of the fence which lead to all the horrors and betrayals he has witnessed and been a full participant in.  His paradox is a painful one; rejecting "Karl Marx, God, and all the rest of it", he is also a man beginning to realize that his career in espionage is one of sheer immorality. ---  --- Claire Bloom's Nan Perry is the catalyst for the tragic and unforgettable ending of the film.  A young woman Leamas meets while he works in a London library awaiting his next assignment from the charming and bone-chilling head of operations in Britan, George Smiley, she is also an avowed Communist.  When things come to a head and she is dragged into the brutal world Leamas inhabits, he tries desperately to communicate that she is only "a frustrated little girl from a crackpot library".   ---  --- But the most heinous betrayal here is Leamas' skillful befriending and cold use of real Communist Oskar Werner.  Leamas pretends to defect from the British Agency and stages a brawl with a grocer to increase his appearance of discontent.  Werner is the to whom he discloses fictitious "secrets" about American espionage, all the while having cynical and hilarious dialogues with him about the whole situation. ---  --- At the end, with two victims of the dirty business he's involved himself in for some vague principle (protecting the "moronic masses"), Leamas cannot go on.  He is very much on the fence so to speak and ends up on the wrong one quite intentionally. A haunting, beautiful movie.   ---  ---   ---   --- 
My son was 7 lbs 1 oz when he was born and 20 inches long... He wasnt the tiniest baby... I tried putting him in the sling and it just looks like he's falling and being enveloped by this huge orange thing... It's the WORST product ever, I am definitely NOT using it and will probably donate it to goodwill..
I have owned this watch for over a month now and I can note the following: ---  --- The watch has a diameter of approximately 40mm and is around 10mm thick. Both these number seem average and it looks good on an average size wrist. ---  --- The watch is a bit heavy, but sits comfortably on the wrist. The bracelet rarely pulls the hair, although I have plenty of it. ---  --- The watch is easy to accumulate scratches, but not on the glass. I have scratched the steel around the glass (as well as other places), but the sapphire resists remarkably. ---  --- The time keeping is very accurate, compared to the atomic clock on the web. After a month it has advanced less than half a second ahead, which will result in a six second difference at most per year. I guess results may vary between different watches, but it seems nevertheless impressive and trustworthy enough. ---  --- The timer is very easy to start, stop and reset, with one button pushes. Very fast and convenient. ---  --- The alarm can barely be heard, so is not appropriate for waking. It is useful though for reminders, in a noise free location. Not difficult to set, but takes some time, comparable with setting an alarm on a cell phone. Since it is relative to the secondary time keeping mechanism, you can have a second time zone set and advance the alarm relative to that. ---  --- This watch does not seem to attract special attention to it and has not gained any comments so far, without me bringing it in a conversation. Is pretty conservative, but I personally like that. ---  --- The price of this watch in amazon seems to fluctuate between 100 and 140 dollars. If the price is higher than 130, I would wait a tad, but not hold my breath too long. It is definately worth the money though, since i have seen several Seiko watches like this one enter their 20 or 30 years of age and still continue strong. For a dependable, accurate, water proof watch for every occasion, most probably you cannot do better than this
My 15-month-old son pulled these off (and broke one) within about 5 minutes of installing them.  Also, he was able to turn the covers which ended up turning on the gas. ---  --- Bad design.  Don't waste your money
My 3 year old son loves this watch.  You can change all of the pieces of the band to different colors and different sizes.  It clicks on easily and doesn't come off -- even on a child's arm.  I am very happy with this watch
Russians and Yankees team up to save the world in "Meteor", one of the last gasps in the celebrity-disaster movies of the 1970s'.  (Like the "Airport" movies - you'd have a bunch of celebs tossed around for no other purpose than to have their headshots printed along a strip at the bottom of the movie poster.)   ---  --- In "Meteor", a huge chunk of an asteroid, blasted out of its benign orbit after by a wayward comet, is now heading towards earth.  Called "Orpheus", the chunk is 5 miles wide and promises to kick off a nuclear winter on arrival.  The only hope left are two space-based missile platforms lofted into orbit by NASA and the Soviet Union - each pointed at targets on Earth rather than into space.  (I don't remember if the platforms, named for Hercules and "Peter the Great" actually violated any treaties, but their owners sure seemed keen on keeping them secret.)  The Americans learn of the incoming asteroid first, having fatally positioned one of their spacecraft in the asteroid belt at the moment of the comet's collision.  They then learn that Hercules is "light" -they'll need extra missiles, and since they don't have any time to put new ones into space (and as Henry Fonda's president puts it memorably, they can't just "conjure some out of thin air") they'll have to go to the Russians for help.  Waiting for Orpheus to hit, the plot boils down to scenes of the scientists realigning their missile platforms away from Earth, and other scenes showing the devastation wrought by smaller "splinters".  (In an interesting move, there aren't any subtitles for the international targets.)  ---  --- Even if you find the special effects lame, the score annoying and the plot thin and holed as if it too was struck by a meteor, "Meteor" surprisingly gets some good mileage from its stars.  Sean Connery is great in a post-Bond role as the civilian designer of Hercules - a NASA fixture who resigned when his program was taken over by the military ("Hercules" was apparently designed just for this eventuality).  Brian Keith is also great as Dubov, Connery's Russian counterpart.  The script has most of the Yankees getting along with the Russians, so he's never a foil for Connery, but he gets some good scenes going from a genial to an enraged Soviet, improbably speaking all his lines in Russian.  Karl Malden also rises above what seems like an incredibly unnecessary role as a NASA bureaucrat - he's neither scientist, engineer or politician, but he keeps Connery's maverick in line.  Landau, a great actor, plays the thankless role of the cold-war hawk of a general who fears the Russians more than shooting stars.  The FX are actually pretty good for pre-CGI (mostly excelling in the space sequences).  The music seems repetitive, but Laurence Rosenthal's score is also evocative of the Russians and the oncoming Asteroid.  Much of the movie drags on and many sequences seem redundant. (Did they need all of the "splinter" scenes?  The "Avalanche" sequence is most ludicrous - the world is coming to an end, but there's no hint on any of the faces of those out skiing the alps in that sequence.)  That said, the plusses and minuses of this flick make it memorable, and the plusses make it worth watching.  The script places the control center for Hercules underneath the old AT&T bulding in TriBeCa, and I admit I can't pass the place without thinking of this movie
I bought this pump the day I was discharged from the hospital (12/11/05). I have used it on a part time basis since I am staying home and nurse directly. However, the motor broke and couldn't pump anymore. My baby is only 5 months and this pump already broke. I have only used it during nights to keep a storage for my baby. I was lucky to call Medela on time since this pump is still under its 6 month warranty period so I could get my money back.
I did a great deal of research on the Internet for the "best" shower filter. I was concerned about the filter not lasting, losing water pressure, etc. I came across the Aquasana on amazon and read all the great reviews on it... After ordering it, I am so glad that I did. It was really easy to install and I honestly feel like the water pressure coming out of it is BETTER than with my old shower head. The shower head swivels and has several different settings, like massage, rainfall-type flow, etc. It really does feel like you are showering in spring water. Just the idea of showering in chlorine-free and mineral-free water is refreshing in itself. I am really happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend it to anyone living in an apartment who wants filtered water and who cannot install a filter on the main line.... It's a little pricy but well worth it.
Terrible reception.  Tinny speaker.  Radio does not "remember" last used station when turned off.  Don't waste your money
Do you want the real secret on how to grow your hair? First, you need to have a healthy diet that includes plenty of vegetables and protein. PROTEIN! Then you have to keep your hair and scalp clean, trim your ends, and not use heating appliances all the time! Lastly, drink water! That's the secret! You go on a hair care board and you'll find people who swear by Vivisical. They'll show you before and after pictures and in the after picture it's just the person with their head tilted all the back just to make it look like their hair grew 5 inches in 2 months! Don't believe that nonsense! If you buy Viviscal, you're a sucker! You're better off just taking a multi-vitamin
I have owned the Caruso Molecular steam hairsetter for at least the last 15 years and would not buy any other hairsetting product. It is gentle on the hair and gives a wonderful, soft, steamed curl, as opposed to harsh, electric hot curlers. I recently purchased the new "smaller version", because my old one - with the larger water/heating unit, burned out after many years of use. The old one required more water and a bit of salt. It gave great steam, filling the rollers with a lot of steam, thus giving a better curl to the hair. This newer version does not require salt, uses very little water, and does not have the steam making power the older version did. I am very dissappointed in this "newly designed" product. I have packed it away, and will use it only as a back up. I hate it when you use a product for many years and find they have upgraded, improved, or discontinued the product. Sometimes, it is best to leave well enough alone. I will purchasing one of the older hairsetters on Ebay
You can only ride for 45 minutes after charging the battery for 12 hours. Forget about buying an extra battery to charge while you ride, because of the adapter it only charges while its on  the machine. There is no seperate battery charger.
If you want the original recordings, don't purchase any volume of Television's Greatest Hits.  I've had better luck recording the songs off of my TV with a cassette tape recorder and then dehissing them on my PC.  These collections have sterile sounding fake stereo recordings of "The Beverly Hillbillies" and "The Munsters" that just don't sound right to me.  If the original recordings don't matter to you, then you may like this CD
Wonderful instrumentals and lyrics.  A Shenandoah Lullaby is simply beautiful.  I love the way the ending segues into Brahm's lullaby.   His version of Arkansas traveller is refreshing.  Teddy Bears' Picnic is a quaint song that few people have heard.  There Ain't No Bugs On Me is my two-year-old daughter's favorite, judging from the way she belts out this song and giggles from time to time.  I like all the songs on the CD.  A breath of fresh air for parents who prefer real instruments to synthesized pop.
This product could put user/customer's life at risk. The mapping software navigates user turning into a one way street and takes you to a very remote off-road. This is the worst product that I have used in my life.
It reminded me of when I got mud in my mouth, while playing diggers in the garden as a child! --- Sorry but this wasn't for me I'm affaid.  --- The water just turned black and it tasted 'earthy'
I have loved Dolce & Gabanna light blue since it came out.  I was so excited to find it at such a competitive price at amazon, and am certainly a satisfied customer!  The shipping was so fast, I was expecting to wait at least 2 weeks, and it was delivered ahead of schedle!  Thanks so much
Beautifully done, Kids Discover issues are packed with information on one specific subject (ie: volcanoes, the Civil War...). My daughter is 8 and a good student. She uses these magazines as reference texts more than as casual reading material. I think these magazines would be enjoyed most by parents and students between the ages of 10 to 14. --- 
A very good, very quick military history overview - hits all the main points without belaboring any, gives the reader a good list of authors to look at after finishing Howard
I wish that I could review how well this charger works, but unfortunately I can't.  The reason is because it was dead on arrival.  I essentially bought a $20.00 (with eek technology's outrageous shipping) brick.  It never worked, ever, and shipping it back to exchange would cost more than a new unit!  At least I have the 4 batteries it came with, so it isn't a total loss.  Don't make the same mistake.  Steer clear of this piece of junk
I love EVERY track on Ne-Yo's CD "in my own words!" Next let me thank Ne-Yo for bringing true R&B back to the industry! I dont consider songs about cheating on your bf/gf/husband/wife R&B. R&B is supposed to be about love - thats why people call them slow LOVE songs. And from 2001 - 2005 new slow love songs didn't exist. I ended up listenin to the same songs from da 90's over and over until I got so tired of them, and was fortunate to be lucky enough for my radio station (that plays mostly rap: a genre of music I dont like) to play "so sick" by Ne-Yo. It was a great song. This is literally the FIRST and only R&B album that I never have the urge to use the fast forward feature to get to the next song! Ne-Yo's lyrics are strictly romantic and sweet too! He is a lyrical genius. His voice is soothing and melodic. Most R&B albums obviously have rap tracks or rushed R&B songs as filler to probably meet the deadline or get the CD out as fast as possible and reducing the enjoyability of the CD, but THIS album has ALL songs that are great. All of the tracks on this album are great, but here are the ones that are SUPERB: ---  --- 1. So sick - 9/10 (would be a 10 if it wasn't played over and over and with so many different versions. Although I can still listen to it over and over --- 2. When you're mad - 9/10 (for those guys who like the look on girls faces when they get mad. Maybe for Michelle Rodriguez fans. :) ) --- 3. Get Down Like that 10/10 (both versions) (I call it "dont get down like that") (This song is for the guys that are completely faithful like me) (if you're not a player, and proud of being faithful, this is da song for you) --- 4. Sexy Love - 10/10 (great song. um hmmm.. what can i say about THIS one about its lyrics?.... oh yes.... this song is for the guys who have a girl and when she touches them, it just feels like.... Magic.) ---  --- This is da only CD dat ever deserved 5 stars by me, the only reason I gave OTHER R&B albums 5 stars is cuz i took into consideration: there was no R&B album that existed that had NOTHING but good tracks, and most had poorly done upbeat song
This Air Supply should've been cut off a very long time ago.  Whenever any of their songs comes on the radio I immediately shut it off.  Bad ear candy is all they ever recorded.  Mindless, sappy garbage.  Even Bread's music  was more interesting than this
I don't want to spoil this movie for others and I won't. CACHE is French for HIDDEN and  alot was left hidden. Why does the son suddenly do what he did? Why does he think his mother is doing what he thinks she's doing? I didn't care one bit about any of the charactors. This is a slow going movie with no conclusion. If you have a choice between watching this movie or watching paint dry, flip a coin. I watch international films often and usually fnd them more rewarding than most US made films. Not this one.
Gave these to my wife as part of a birthday gidt and she loves them. She says they feel more comfortable than most "stud"-type and they look great
Nothing even close to "say no More" I'm sorry I spent the mone
There are two good ways to tell what audience at which a woodworking magazine is aimed.  The first is the type of advertising, and the second is how much skill do the projects expect you to have.  It is pretty clear right away that Woodworker's journal server home woodworkers who are already of moderate skill.  The advertised 'big toys' run in the 500 to 1500 dollar range, although there are a couple of high end combination machines in the adds as well.   ---  --- Articles expect you to know how to use the tools of the trade but not sure about the 'best' way to do something.  A recent issue makes a study of an intarsia backed high chair with some interesting joinery, and instructions for making a genuinely exotic angle jig for a table saw.  Writing is solid and reasonably illustrated, but they devote little space to what you should already know, which can make these projects a stretch for a tyro. ---  --- The Magazine is very tool oriented.  There isn't a lot of space devoted to hand tools or history.  Expect articles comparing nail guns and helping you decide whether stationary or bench top equipment is right for you.  However, traditionally manual tasks like finishing also receive their due.  I found the Woodworker's Journal suited me quite well, and I expect to continue reading it
A friend gave this to me for my 6 month old daughter - the walker itself is wonderful, but the light and sound feature is just the worst - as others have said, it dies after about 2 months, and the battery is non-replacable. My daughter loved the sounds and now they just die and warble and I can't stand it! If you buy it, don't get it for the music/lights - they will let you down
I'm not certain why there are so many glowing reviews for this product.  My wife registered for this item because the 4 stage tub looked good in theory.  Unfortunately, because of the collapsible design this "bath" tub does not hold water, it just runs out of the seam where the two sides come together.  There is a foam gasket around the seam that is intended to hold the water in, but it is useless. --- The sling is useful for bathing an infant, and the removable ring does it's job of keeping an infant upright while learning to sit.  Unfortunately, by the time our infant was ready to sit we had already replaced this piece of junk.  I guess they call it Safety 1st as your kid can't drown in a dry bath tub
I have enjoyed eating Marzipan, since a child.  Now many, many --- years later I still enjoy eating it on Holidays. It is a combination of cooking and artwork. This Wisconsin Cheeseman, --- company makes the best Marzipan I have ever had.  It is not too --- sweet like most others make it, and it light and not doughy. --- Eating their Marzipan is a blissful experience, and after a busy --- day of working, this is my private joy.  I highly recommend it, --- and I feel that everyone should try Marzipan at least once in --- their life, you will not be sorry
This edition of the color calibration hardware and software is very professional - a fact that is reflected in the price tag. However, the difference between the uncalibrated and calibrated states on a television is very noticeable. --- The kit includes the colorimeter (color measurement device) with a USB connection. The assumption here is that a laptop or nearby desktop is available to calibrate the televisions. The software makes calibration extremely easy. It allows the user to select which color and picture controls the TV allows them to use (not all televisions present the same controls, and even then, they often have different names) and modifies its process accordingly. Calibration takes approximately 30-45 minutes, but the results are undeniably an improvement. --- The kit comes in a sturdy plastic case with foam cutouts for the hardware and software (much like a Stargate SG-1 case for an alien device :-) ). While expensive, the software and hardware can be used on nearly anything that displays a picture - TVs of any kind and computer monitors - without limit. --- The one caveat is that, for LCD and other TVs or monitors with "delicate" screens, the suction cup provided to stick the colorimeter to the device requires a good deal of force. In fact, the force required is more than I am comfortable with applying to any display I have, except CRTs. As such, calibration requires one to either hold the colorimeter to the TV for each measurement (not really a problem), or buy the tripod for the device. This is the only downside. --- This device is definitely of professional quality and is a must for any home theater enthusiast or the perfectionist in your household. It might even be possible to recover the cost of the unit by becoming a calibration technician... :-
I also had the older Diaper Champ and it broke so I got this new one, "New And Improved"! I don't know if they've ever tested this product. It's impossible to get the diaper bag out of the Diaper champ. It's big from the bottom and small from the top so when you try to get the bag out of it, it always gets stuck and if you try harder then the bag rips! It's absolutely horrible product. NEW OR SOON TO BE MOMS - DO NOT BUY THIS!!
  This is the all time, great, original classic.  The remake is .......ok --- at best.   Add this to your classic movie collection.  ---  Highly recommended
I ordered my subscription 3 months ago and still have not received it. 
I had this for my daughter when she fit into the baby carrier car seat.  It was awesome.  I never had to worry about blankets falling off or if she was warm enough.  They did tell me at the hospital, however, that if you put anything between your baby and the car seat it voids the warranty on the car seat.  This goes underneath them so it probably does, but I figured it was probably safer than putting a blanket over her anyway
This Yakima roof rack system works great and I highly recommend it. I bought one for my Mazda 3 and have use it, along with a Yakima roof rack for 2 cross country ski trips (I live a Florida, skiing is far away). The rack hasn't shifted an inch and was relatively easy to install. Yakima has a product guide on their site to make sure you order the right pieces for your model car
It gave me a lot of energy and I was able to lift a noticeable amount of weight on my first work out using the product.  I also noticed better and faster results from using No-Xplode.  I like it
Sound quality was fine but this CD changer doesnt work well at all. I am one of the buyers that had the same problems as many others with the CD changer. Tried to play shuffle with all discs and it just stops playing after a while. It also has problems just changing to the next sequential CD. Apparently Sony didn't do proper quality testing on this product. I returned mine and after these other reviews won't be replacing it with a Sony. I hope this is a message to Sony. 
I am 51 and recently visited an upscale retail store in Manhattan.  The Yves St Laurent gal behind the cosmetic counter noticed my complexion was a little sallow - put this product about an inch on each side of my nose and blended it in..what a difference it made...a worthwhile investment..I use it under my eyes and just about all over my face for a nice touch-up, concealer and brightener..covers freckles and sun spots, too
The case looks great and fits well, but it's nearly impossible to remove.  I had to insert a credit card between the latches and pry for a long time.  I was afraid of hurting both the case and the iPod.  In addition, it's too wide in the case to dock in my Logitech speaker system.  I might have considered keeping it if I could have just snapped the case off for docking
This is a great puppet theater, sound stage, restaurant, play house, etc...  My daughter was 4 when she received this from Santa.  He only wished he had found it sooner!  My daughter continues to love it, and will now be sharing it with her younger sister.  Many hours of pretend have been spent inside and outside this theater.  We especially love it because it is large enough inside for two or more children.  All the others we researched were too small for our needs.  The colors are so vibrant and fun, we get tons of compliments from all our company.  All the kids gravitate towards it
I could not get the right code numbers to work with my new TV/DVD set.....too bad, I liked the large numbers and light.
The original nursers enabled me to return to work after a long maternity leave.  My baby wouldn't take the bottle until I introduced the brown rubber nipple.  Thanks Mom
Ok, first of all Oct Fri the 13th I FINALLY saw this movie in 3D, sigh I can die happy! Ok this one is really pretty awesome. Chris plays a great leading girl (the only F-13 leadI didnt want to see with an axe in her skull). The other characters are pretty harmless too. Wev'e got bikers (snort), pothead hippies, a fro'd chubster and a dude who can walks on his hands better than he can act. Plus this came out in the early 80's so the ratings board didnt demolish all the awesome gore scenes. I give this one a high-5! Cool deaths, funny scenes and aside from Chris's sherbert pants, some decent 80's fashion too. Yo Debbie, I want your bikini, too cuuute.
So it's not a big deal to reset your clocks when the time changes and when the power goes out, right? Well... yes it is. As I get older and technology becomes more demanding and time consuming, the fact that I can have ONE DEVICE that takes care of itself has become fairly important to me. It's just a clock, but... it works. Which is more than I can say for my fax or copier or phone or... I always get LaCross because I like the looks of their stuff. Be good to yourself- upgrade to Atomic
The Rion Mini Lean-To greenhouse comes in a flimsy cardboard box that contains about a hundred plastic parts. It difficult to put together because the parts are poorly labeled. (Making it even more difficult for me was that several parts were missing.) The 12 page instruction manual shows several diagrams - but no photos - with parts labelled to help with assembly. One classic exerpt on page 7, "The 'OUT' on the 2D connector should face the inside of the Mini Lean-To". This kind of product gives the term "some assembly required" a bad name.  ---  --- Also, it's a bit pricely to be so flimsy and poorly designed. Save yourself the trouble get something else.  ---  ---  --- 
How can we ever be disappointed by a Anthony Hopkins performance? In my opinion, one of the best actors of all time ( especially his portrayal of Hannibal Lecter ). In this movie, he plays a anthropologist first living in Africa among the rare and beautiful mountain gorillas. After defending the gorillas and killing 2 poachers in the process, he is captured and sent to a mental institution where a psychologist played by Cuba Gooding Jr.( who gives a good performance) tries to delve in the mind of Hopkins' character and help him. I just love the flashbacks to Africa and the gorillas. Very touching scenes in this movie along with great acting. My favorite part of the movie is the ending where we see Hopkins return to the gorillas and the place he feels he truly belongs and truly wants to be. Great movie!
Jonathan should spent more time with Scott from Zorbitt because the packaging is second rate.  The product itself was subpar also
The unit requires registration and an authorization number from the manufacture before maps can be loaded into the compact flash card. This requires determining the CF card ID when registering. Instructions for this procedure are very poor and navigating Magellan's web site is tricky at best. If you enter the CF ID incorrectly, you cannot store any maps in the unit even if you are provided an authorization code for the CF card. Beware
I purchased this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it...as do I.  It isn't too 'perfume-y' and smells terrific
I am a parent of a 9 year old daughter who loves dolls. She was given the Love me CHOU CHOU doll for Christmas (12/25/05). On Christmas day we were unable to get the doll to fall asleep, so on 12/26/05 I went back to the store to exchange the doll. With no luck I found that the second doll would not fall asleep either. I looked on the zapf-creation web-site under most frequently asked questions and received more instructions on how to get the doll to fall asleep and still the doll will not fall asleep.  ---   --- Apparently this is a problem, not only with the doll my daughter has but with other customers as well. If the company knows that this is one of the most frequently asked questions, why not remodel the doll so she can fall asleep like the instructions say? It is very discouraging for a 9 year old who has hopes of seeing the doll do something that is being advertised and it does not do that. It is also very upsetting to a parent who has to continue going back and forth to a store and hopes of looking for a working doll. These dolls are very expensive and should work like the instructions say they should.   ---  --- We have tried everything we can to get the Love me chou chou doll to fall asleep and nothing seems to make that happen.. I have even spoken with another parent in the store where the doll was purchased and was advised her daughter also was crying on Christmas day because they could not get the doll to fall asleep. She then explained, she had her mother a grandmother to rock the doll and guess what the doll finally fell asleep keep in mind this was not rock-a-bye chou chou. We have even tried to rock this doll with no luck of getting the doll to fall asleep. ---   --- I have even taken the doll back to the store for an exchange, but was advised the doll is no longer being sold at the store where I purchased it. ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  
**** --- Tazo's Decaffeinated Chai Black Tea is an enjoyable chai experience for the most part. On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a rich blend of full-flavored naturally decaffeinated teas and exotic aromatic spices." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Decaffeinated Chai as "creamy, vanilla, sweet and pungent spices". Tazo describes the aroma as "sweet spice". Those are pretty accurate. The black tea "blend" is a little bitter, though, even with minimal brewing. It's a real trick to get it to brew long enough to get to experience the flavor from the spices without having the tea turn bitter. ---  ---  --- The ingredients in Decaffeinated Chai are: naturally decaffeinated black teas, rooibos, cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, chicory, cloves, black pepper, natural flavors, and star anise. It is caffeine-free! ---  --- Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea. ---  --- I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Decaffeinated Chai gets only four stars. --- ***
I am so disappointed that it did not have any closed caption or subtitle for the deaf.  I had to return it
Simply THE tool for getting your business put together.  It's able to do just about everything you'd ever want to do!!
Other than the power switch is not easy to see, the most issue with this microphone is the sound quality  not that good.  Use this microphone to record music for sure will disappoint you.  Even using it for church meeting recording, you would not get excited for its sound quality. ---  --- If you can tolerate the size of Sony ECM-MS907, you may like the sound quality of that microphone. If you like a small lapel microphone with true voice, try the AKG WMS-40 wireless system.  Our people are much happier with the AKG wireless microphone than this one. --- 
Completely useless. Only shows a digital display when Ipod is "fully charged" -- how long does YOUR Ipod stay fully charged? Even when showing digital display doesn't actually broadcast. Maxell replaced it with the p-4A for a reason. Amazon shouldn't even be selling this, it makes me distrust Amazon. I got it as a Christmas present but it was bought in October so they won't even take it back.  ---  --- Follow up: After I emailed Amazon, they issued a complete refund, which they refused to do over the phone. Now they just need to pull the product, since they (probably wisely) aren't carrying the P-4A and therefore can't recommend it as an option.
... I highly recommend this magazine to anyone interested or immersed in the graphic design industry. I have kept every single issue and frequently refer to them for ideas, reference, or to simply get those creative juices flowing. HOW's biggest asset is their dedication to helping the reader understand the business side of the industry and the all important client relationship. HOW does not exclude anyone in that they address the different issues agencies and freelancers face when conducting business
Well, besides a whole bucket full of money, one of them lets you take photos in lower light, okay, that's obvious. The 16-35mm is a bit heavier, but not so you'd notice, unless maybe you were carrying it around all day, without eating and you're a bit over the hill. So why pay the extra money, unless, of course, you do a lot of shooting in the early morning and late evening? ---  ---  Maybe you shouldn't, because I've been doing a lot of photo taking with both, film and digital, and as one would expect from the "L" lenses, the photos are crisp and sharp. In fact I keep I the 17-40 on the camera I carry around all day, you know, the one I might leave on the table in a restaurant when I got to the restroom. It's a lot less money to lose to someone looking for a five finger discount. However, my gal pal Sara and I take a lot of early morning photos. She shoots old houses, and she never, ever goes out without the 16-35mm. She swears by it, loves it, sometimes I think better than me. ---  --- So there is a difference, I'm the kind of person that could happily live with less expensive lense, Sara is not. However they both deliver gorgeous photos. You can't go wrong if the lense has that red circle around it. ---  --- Jack Priest, Sailor Home from the Se
if you have used the online version in the past, stick with it. buying it on disk does not allow you to import data from previous returns if done on line and you can not upload to myturbotax. almost as if two separate companies! plus the User interface on this software stinks bigtime. very hard to navigate back and forth. online version is actually better (though i didn't try it this year). does intuit actually employ programmers or watch real users? they spend far too much money on useless features like videos and not enough on simple ui issues
Saw this on Jay Leno and it was a Hilarious Gift!  Tried it out and it dances to the chicken dance song and when you grab its neck it yelpsand pretends to choke then when you let go it continues its dance.  I Can't wait to give it as a Christmas Present.
The cover is exactly what I needed to protect our smoker from the weather. It is strong and appears to be durable.  I felt that the price was fair for this product
This is the perfect little tv/dvd for a little girl's room! The picture is great and Hello Kitty pops on screen for certain commands (volume, channel change..). My daughter age 4 loves it. I would have given this product 5 stars but there are a couple drawbacks...the remote control is has SO many buttons and they are VERY tiny, very close together. I can barely read what each button does because the labels/print is also VERY tiny. This is annoying when in my daughter's darkened room and I have to turn on a bright light just to find the pause button... the other thing I have to point out that bugs me is that you can't eject/or open the dvd player unless the tv is in dvd mode. In other words when I go to put in a dvd, I can't just push "open". Nothing will happen. You have to find the right button, choose "dvd" from a choice of 3-4 things, and only then will the tray slide open. All in all, these things would not prevent me from buying this tv again...although it would be nice if they did come out w/ a more kid friendly remote with bigger buttons/symbols for a small child to recognize... One great thing I want to point out--there is fast forward scan that you can watch as it fast forwards (something not all dvd players offer) and this is great when you are putting a dvd in for your child and they want to skip all those pre-movie ads....you can FF right to the beginning of the movie!!!    
Wish I could give this a negative.  When I did finally get a sticker out, it wouldn't stay stuck to anything for more than five minutes.  Ended up sending it back to the wholesaler as unworkable and overpriced
My kids got these from Grandpa.  They love them!  They're fun to bowl with in a dark room.  We've clipped them onto headboards for a decent-sized reading light. ---  --- The problems: The clip is pretty hard to operate, even for an adult.  Also, the plastic base broke on each of our lights (in different places), so now they're clip-less.  They're still well-loved and well-used by the little guys, though.   ---  --- I recommend these lights, but be careful w/ the bases
My 3 year old daughter got this puzzle for Christmas and she simply adores it. This is her fourth Melissa & Doug puzzle and I have to say she loves them all. As soon as she is done with one she puts it away and runs for another one. Keep making wonderful puzzles Melissa & Doug!
Label states that it is for a 600....it doesnt fit a 650 as well as I thought i
Another lense jam problem. The lense cover accidentally slide open in my pocket, and the lense extended and jammed. This happened frequently with my old Powershot S30 but never caused a problem.  ---  --- Canon said the warranty is void because there's a tiny dent on the front and back. They said ANY physical damage voids the warranty. I complained that the camera has an all metal body which dings easily. They gave me 20% off the repair
I used to buy pods at Starbucks, but I started longing for something a little more authentic. Luckily, my fiancee bought me the PodMerchant Megasampler as a Christmas present. I was overwhelmed! ---  --- I never knew there were so many different kinds of espresso pods available, especially from one store. The selection in this sampler is huge, and it includes both caffeinated and decaf pods.  (There is also the Super Sampler but it doesn't include decaf, which is nice sometimes in the evening). ---  --- After trying these pods we found which espressos we liked best and have been buying those, but it all started with the Mega sampler. The shipping was also very fast. ---  --- If you're looking to expand your coffee horizons and have an espresso pod machine, you'll almost certainly find some new favorites in here
This is a surprisingly poor movie. Although it has some well-known actors, and a notable director, the material was just presented badly and predictably - like a lousy late night TV-movie with profanity inserted to liven it up. ---  --- The movie makes a simplified joke of the legal system and its sterotypical failings (though legitimate in many cases). It also glosses over the grieving process of the family, ignores the normal safety warnings to the remaining child, overdoes Kiefer Sutherland's character flaws (which are considerable nevertheless), and generally oversimplifies everything into a neat package to which you already know the ending because of the spoiler title. ---  --- In one particularly-bad scene, after taking martial arts classes and other measures to prepare herself mentally and physically, Sally's character simply stares open-mouthed and dumbfounded at Keifer's character when they meet on the street and he talks to her. ---  --- I don't know what I missed that the 4- and 5-star reviewers like so much. I only see wide-spread mediocrity. ---  --- I would only recommend this for fans of Keifer. "Ssssssorry", Sally, not your best role or movie. Ditto Ed Harris, whose other movies I generally like. --- 
I just cam from Las Vegas and the sandisk has a disk error that doesn't allow for more photos after only using 40mb. I have tried to format the disk using the camera and through Windows XP. It doesn't allow it to be formatted. Bad investment!!! Would not recommend the product unless there is a way I can get a refund or an exchange
purchased the phone about 3 months, like the nice QVGA screen, and impressed with excellent cam (it works pretty well in macro mode and outdoors) --- the phone has good reception, at least on par with W810 --- voice call is OK, but as other users stated, the level is kinda low (esp speakerphone), firmware upgrade (R1KC001) will help --- the operation is standard SE style, if you are familiar, you'll be OK without reading manual --- the audio player can play streaming 3gp and realaudio (still used by BBC), and it works well with T-Mobile internet; it can play local mp3 (VBR supported), wma, asf audio (rename the extension to .wma), realaudio; but I wish it supports ogg vorbis, which is the audio format I use --- bluetooth works pretty well, it works with ALL bt equipment I have (including wireless headphones) --- logitech headphones users please read: in order to make the headphones works properly, you need to go to bt menu, and connect from there --- web browser can handle regular html sites as well as simplified html, and wap sites --- the phone is kinda bulky, and a bulge on cam cover, but it's pretty comfortable and firm to hold, making messaging is a good pleasure --- though the phone has lot of functions/features are pretty appealing, it lacks something it's supposed to have: --- quad-band, this is not acceptable for this price, even many lower models have quad-band (K550, W610, W580, W810, Z710, W710) --- music player should have more file format support: ogg vorbis, streamimg wma/asf, shoutcast --- m2 memory card, though the phone has possibility to support up to 32GB, PSP card is a lot cheaper --- pro: --- QVGA screen, and it shows clock when the phone is idle --- wireless headphones support --- 3mpx cam with auto-focus and xenon flash --- comfortable and firm to hold --- con: --- low earpiece and speakerphone level (though firmware upgrade will fix) --- tri-band --- cam cover bulge --- conclusion: if you want a phone with excellent screen and cam, go for it, however, if you travel a lot, settle with quad-band models (they're cheaper
I gave birth to a premature infant that had to spend a week in the NICU.  Because of that I was forced to establish my milk supply w/ a breastpump.  The morning after I gave birth my husband went Walmart to pick up some of things that we hadn't purchased.  I called him crying and told him that he had to find something for my sore nipples.  Well this is what he brought back.  The relief was instantaneous. I bought a couple more boxes as my daughter "learned" to breastfeed.  I use another of their nipple creams for everyday use(they're too expensive to use everday), but I make sure that there is always a box of these in my cabinet! 
Did not work at all. I used cheaper products that I bought from walgreens and walmart that reduced the razor bumps but not completely eliminate them. --- Since Princereigns promised to be a miracle product, I bought it in hopes of completely eliminating the bumps but it did't even reduce them. Complete waste of money
These guys and this album rocks.  Just because the songs force you to move other parts of your body beside your head, doesn't 'demote' it to pop.  Props to the great use of two bass guitars.  Released amid the misery/grunge rock explosion of the early 90's, this was a great escape into rock that just simply made you feel good again. This album is highly recommended.  Kill Your Television, Grey Cell Green, Cut Up, Throwing Things, Happy, and Until You Find Out are just an awesome experience.  If you can find the Grey Cell Green single release, I highly recommend that for the track entitled 'Trust.' 
Gone are the days of overpriced department store products that do absolutly nothing for your skin! Gone are the days of spending too much money for a product that sits in your bathroom and collects dust! ---  --- This is stuff is kick ass! --- If you are the type to buy a product that is endorced by a celebrity, then you can be satisfied here, and if you go to the Mario Badescu website you can see all the celebrities who have gone to the spa and used the products. ---  --- If you are looking for a product that makes your skin feel clean and fresh, without spending your paycheck, then you have found the perfect company!!! ---  --- I have been using the products from Mario Badescu for three years now, and I have gotten my Mom, Mother-in-Law, Sister, and other friends and family to become Mario Badescu junkies too. ---  --- That all said, if you want something to pamper yourself look no further. ---  --- (Try the Seaweed Soap, and the Orange Protective Cream. And if you have a problem with Pimples then look for the drying lotion, but beware its strong stuff.
If you have never heard Book Of Shadows by Zakk Wylde, then you may be suprised by this album. The two albums are similiar in that they contain a lot more acoustic guitar, and although I'm not saying that past releases have not contained emotion, HM VI contains more. ---  --- For example, take 'She Deserves a free ride' and the ballad 'Fear'. The piano on this album is superb, haunting at one point and almost relaxing at another. However, there is just enough of past 'metal' BLS in this album - 'Crazy or High' and 'House Of Doom'. Personal favourites are 'Damage is Done', 'Layne' and 'Queen Of Sorrow'. There is something more in the solo's - they come in at just the right time and as usual are perfectly executed - check out 'Stepping Stone' for an example. The musicianship has got even better on this album, with the dodgy drums on 1919 Eternal Gone, and the bass that was pushed to the background in The Blessed Hellride is up there with Zakk's playing. ---  --- This album is deep, moving piece that is the perfect successor to the blistering Blessed Hellride. Can't wait for the new Mafia CD to be released.
Wonderful magazine! The receipes are excellent, I have tried several and they are all keepers! They are tasty, low calorie, high fiber etc. The format of the magazine is great and there interesting articles as well as recipes
This is one of my favorite cereals! It appears to be nutritionally superior to the Heritage O's and less crunchy.  --- The only downside to this cereal is that it doesn't keep me full for long. I feel like an hour later, I'm hungry again. I've combated this by adding banana slices or blueberries to add some bulk to my bowl in hopes of more lasting power.  --- An upside to the 'downside' is that this makes a terrific between meals snack! I have no problem with polishing off all six boxes in a timely manne
These are beautiful earrings.  They are a bit small but the stones are vibrant and rich looking.  My only complaint is that the post part of the earring is not very substantial and I feel as though I need to handle them VERY carefully.  They are extremely comfortable and have just the right amount of movement to them. 
It seems that just about every house in our subdivision has an electric ride-on toy. There are few "Barbie" Jeeps, few polaris ATVs, one Corvette and three Gators and few others. My 4 year old daughter was the first Gator owner. ---  --- I must say, it is expensive.. This thing is by far the most expensive toy my daughter has, bar none. Should you buy your 4 year old $300 ride-on toy? Well... that's up to you. ---  --- But she loves her gator. She had to give up on lot of other toys to get this one, but she is extremely happy with it. Sometimes I wish I was 40lbs so I can ride this thing. She can't care less about the "barbie" thing, so this green utility machine was fine with her.  ---  --- The gator is slightly faster than others and the fat tires and truck bed makes the gator looks a lot more serious than the Barbie jeep. The truck bed is really useful. Although not recommended, she hauled two kids on the bed. With 4 kids on the car, it still zoomed around the street quite well. One time I loaded nail gun, air compressor, electric drill and jigsaw and panel saw all on the bed and asked my daughter to drive to the other side of the yard to fix the fence. I saw our neighbor hauling few bags of mulch on theirs. It made such a funnt scene.. little electric toys carrying real tools and stuff. Very cute. ---  --- Enough of fun stuff.  ---  --- Problem 1. Battery location and the hassle to recharge this thing. You have to open the front grill and sometimes the latch can pinch your finger. It hurts. ---  --- Problem 2. The left front wheel fell off while my daughter was driving it. I tightened it again and never happened.  ---  --- Problem 3. Slipping tires. People complain about the tires having very low friction. They slip very easily on driveway and grass. But this is how it "protects" its gearbox so I don't really care, but I heard they are expensive once they wear out. ---  --- I think this is the best ride-on toy on the market today. If extra $[...] won't hurt you too much, then do consider the gator. Your children will not be disappointed. ---  
To All, ---  --- I just purchased the SP-550UZ after searching for the best camera bang for the buck - Olympus fills the bill..... 3/3/07 was my first day of use and I decided to check ALL the features - with the batteries supplied - still in use and a 2GB card - I took off for the outdoors and began shooting pictures at a local park - 300 pictures - including several 15 FPS and 30 FPS shoots and  three videos - 15, 30 and 45 seconds in length. ---  --- I am not a pro and will be using this camera for Sports, vacations and every day family events. ---  --- No Cons yets - I love the "SCN" feature - just select how you want to take the picture and the camera setups the camera - all you have to do is take the picture
I love chocolate --- I love dark chocolate, especially for my drinking chocolate. --- I should have been suspicious when on the label it says you can make pudding from this as well...which should have alerted me right off the bat that there are other ingredients in the tin--not just chocolate and some sugar...it must be cornstarch. ---  --- Marie Belle makes a big deal of the fact that this is NOT cocoa, but cacao...that's why I fell for the hype...but in the end, it's the flavor that counts, and this one...I guess because of the corn starch...has a strange "mouth feel" and flavor that I find unpleasant. ---  --- I find the French brand  L'Ancienne  far superior...and my favorite drinking chocolate is  --- Charbonnell et Walker, which is not for sale (yet) on Amazon
I bought this because I have fine hair that needs to be washed every day and I get tired of washing it.  I thought I could use this every other day and get by.  ---  --- However, it doesn't make your hair look freshly washed; it is just ok.  It takes "bed head" hair and makes it look acceptable for a little while.  After a couple of hours though, my hair looks oily and stringy again. ---  --- I use it before I take the kids to school and it gets me thru the morning.  Then I end up washing my hair later
Overall this is a very good rowing machine - quiet, takes up a small amount of space, and easy to use. My only complaint would be the LCD - the first order sent to me had a damaged computer, but Amazon was quick to send out a replacement rower which took care of the problem. Now every thing is great
Watching the Melvins evolve was extremely interesting and entertaining. They began as an unassuming punk band, and proceded to incorporate the heaviness of 70's rock into their sound. Then they stripped away any and all of the "punk" trappings and went for pure HEAVY. It all culminated with this record. It just doesn't get any heavier than 'Roman Bird Dog/Hung Bunny'. 'With Teeth', rumored to actually be written by Joe Preston, is one of my all time favorite Melvins songs. Speaking of Joe Preston, he was the by far best of the Melvins' 7000+ bassists they had over the years. Shame they got rid of him shortly after this album. As soon as they fired him, they went straight down the greased pole to mediocrity Hell. Bad karma. Thank God that rock bands record their music so that it isn't lost forever every time they make stupid decisions. The only song on this record which I don't like is the cover of Alice Cooper's 'The Ballad of Dwight Fry'. Thankfully they made up for it with a cover of Flipper's 'Sacrifice'.  ---  --- Some of the Melvins' subsequent records have their moments (Stoner Witch's 'Shevil', Stag's 'Cotton Mouth'), but for the most part it seems to me that the Melvins gave up the ghost after recording this. Maybe someday they'll make a comeback
I bought these shoes for my 23 month old son. We needed something comfortable with a flexible sole, but with enough thickness in the sole to stand up outside and provide traction. They are excellent shoes and he loves them. He won't wear anything else and the shoes receive many compliments
I am a chess player myself, so I can endorse this even more. This software is well designed, it can get a little difficult to get to some exercises inside it, but kids can figure it out eventually. My son has improved his play quite a bit even though he takes hints sometimes :), but this is a good software to get the kids started and teach them all the requisite skills to become a chess playe
It's really hard to buy scrub pants on-line because everyone is different. Cherokee always fits perfectly and good quality. I think they should consider a wider array of sizes in petite. By the time I finished hemming them, I didn't have that cute slit at the bottoms. They wash well and wear well
I ordered this for My daughter when she played t-ball. She played on the cubs team and it was great. Very durable, and adjustable
These are a great, yuumy snack.  For someone who counts calories (or points), it's nice to have an option that is relatively healthy and still tastes great!  I have never met a Luna Bar I didn't like, though this is my favorite flavor
You want a cheap Fender guitar you buy their lower notch brand Squire.You want their lower notch picks,well unfortunately they dont exist.Thats where these come into to play.They are cheap and somewhat durable.Celluloid picks have a tendencey to snap right across the middle though. ---  --- They wield great sound and if used right like any other guitar pick great potential.The looks are nice but i like the signature of a real Fender pick.After all these are the Fender pick shape and size. ---  --- I say buy these the price is a steal.I say avoid these if you plan to play metal. --- (A very nice feeling pick
I have used this item for 2 oil changes and it seems to work well.  I am concerned with the longevity of the hose connections however, I would be afraid that they could develop vacuum leaks over time since it is simply a matter of inserting the drain hose rather than a more formal type of attachment
This DVD teaches the history of Tai Chi, and the History of the 24 posture form and 48 posture form. It explains that these two Tai Chi forms were originally a martial art style, and that now they are usually done for health improvement.  ---  --- Then it shows the 24 posture form from the front, and the back, and with breathing instructions. Im not quite ready to try to coordinate my breathing with the movements, but when I am, this is a great guide. It then shows each of the 24 postures, and their original martial art applications, which helps you have a strong intent during the posture, and keeps your arms and legs in proper position. THEN, it teaches the 24 posture form, step by step, with very detailed instruction. This is a much more expanded version of this video by Master Liang than the original VHS.  ---  --- The DVD also shows the 48 posture form, which repeats several of the movements from the 24 posture form, and has other movements from other styles.  ---  --- It has absolutely helped me develop strength and balance in a few short weeks of practicing only the 24 posture form about 4 days a week on average. It has also improved my confidence, and people keep saying I have a glow about me. I just feel healthier, and happier too.  ---  --- This DVD is easy to learn from quickly. The Chinese bamboo flute music is nice. Oh, actually, my FAVORITE part is at the end, it shows a 'slideshow' of photos of the master, doing each posture move-by-move, with great music. I like to do my form along to this section, because it is a bit slower than the actual form, and you can exactly match your movements to the master. Its like having a one-on-one class with him. I find that this mimicing of his postures has helped me to learn more quickly. I remember the form now, without having to 'THINK', so I can try to turn my attention inward.  ---  --- A great DVD
I'm a huge Orson Welles fan and actually regret making this public knowledge - but I hated this film. I was excited to crack open the beautiful packaging and quickly fell into a disappointing episode of feeling really dumb that I just didn't get it. The photography was classic Welles - the acting was something out of a bad rehersal at an insane asylum. Don't get caught up in having to like it, just because it's Welles - it's ok to go against the grain and declare to the world - this movie blows
Madonna gives a stunning performance...Explicit similated sex and graphic language...We really enjoyed the concert...This is defininatly one of her best...Now if we can get the blond ambition tour from japan and the usa, i would be very happy...5 star rated. i own this disc
This printer sucks! It started out working wonderfully. Then all of a sudden (after the third month in use) it started printing very slowly. Then it decided it wouldn't print at all unless I completely shut down my computer everytime. Something is wrong when you can only get 200 sheets of paper out of text only documents from the black ink cartridge. It also uses the color ink when it's not requested. I only needed the color ink a couple of times (not for pictures) and it went just as fast as the black. I used to love hp. They are now making garbage. I'm thinking of looking at the OKI brand. Don't waste your money on this one
I bought this as a present for my wife.  I was looking for something that she could carry in her purse.  the automatic functions are easy and functional.  It is not an enthusiasts camera:  too hard to get into the menus.  The screen is easy to turn off(this sucks battery power).  and it even has an optical viewfinder(a rare finding lately)  the optical viewfinder helps to get steady pictures for those of us with the shakes.  The pictures are clear and the colors are excellent.  The drawback is the that sony batteries cost an arm and a leg.  The wire for downloading pix is multifunctional and very proprietary(read that as expensive if you lose it
I purchased this frame as a gift for a friend of mine. When I saw it on her desk and noticed the terrible quality of the images, I was embarassed that I had given such an inferior item as a gift.  Perhaps the images she had loaded were quite low resolution, but the pictures looked terrible with huge pixels. ---  --- I would not recommend this item at all
This CD was devoid of any of Govi's usual emotional imprint or soaring guitar work. Frankly, it was just a bunch of New Age background noise that one would hear on elevators. Some of the Craig Chaquico-style stuff was interesting, but better left to Craig. Try 7th Heaven, Mosaico or Guitar Odyssey instead
It just is! Not much else to say about this
The changer performs perfectly.  I was surprised that the price was so high for such a simple gadget.  The only other drawback is that the cord is not as long as the original, about one foot shorter.  Other than that, it is fine.  I gave my original changer to my daughter, whose charger died just before leaving the country
You've got a lot of ab-rollers. You need a gimmick: The product is  no better than the competition. You don't have an ad budget. What do you do?  CHARGE FOUR TIMES AS MUCH. Then just sit and wait for the 'clients' who are looking for a 'quality' product to assume that the high price actually means something
I bought this product for childproofing purposes.  I was disappointed to learn upon delivery that the manufacturer's instructions state not to install gate against drywall (which was not in the item description), so i cannot use it where i needed it.  Also, the unlocking mechanism is quite difficult to open and close, especially with a small child in your arms. 
I am listening to Badfinger even as I type this review. --- This is the Best Of Badfinger Vol 2, and I thought volume 1 was great !! As previous reviewers have said, what an absolute tragedy the story of Badfinger is (Buy the Book "Without You" the tragic story of Badfinger). --- Well I have everything they have released, if you do buy any of the Badfinger best ofs, you will more than likely get hooked and start collecting all of their albums.Some of the best songs on this Cd are off "Wish You Were Here" their best album by a mile IMHO.In fact 6 of the 9 songs on WYWH are on this compilation. --- They were such an original group with every member capable of writing an exhilirating hit song. just have a taste of "Just A Chance", "You're So Fine", "Meanwhile back At The Ranch/Should I Smoke".They were just so good, Damn I miss them
I bought this reader when my engine light came on. Turns out I could fix the problem myself with a 15 dollar part. The dealership was going to charge me over $100
I originally bought this item because I was hoping for the same scent that Yankee candle produces in their candle line.  The smell is nice, although it doesn't reach out and grab you like true buttercream.  Still, it's nice to shower with and you won't be disappointed with the lather.  I put a quarter sized amount on my shower puff and still had to ring out foam from it after I was finished.  Also, the lather is creamy and it just feels like it is moisturizing your skin.  All in all, I am happy with my purchase.  I only gave 4 stars because I like a stronger scent, but if you like more subtlety I'm sure you'll enjoy it
I bought this Brio train set for my 2 1/2 year old niece over Christmas, and she absolutely loves it!  It's a great starter set and can be expanded with other Brio track sets.  Very easy to put together and the pieces are durable.  Makes a great gift
I love how soft and cuddly this changing pad cover is.  I also appreciate how many colors it comes in. ---  --- What I am disappointed with is the durability.  I have 3 of these and have used them for just over a year.  They are totally falling apart at the elastic. Now, keep in mind that we use disposable "chucks" (those blue hospital disposable under pads) on top of this terry cloth changing pad.  It makes it less messy (especially early on) and doesn't require washing as much.  I also washed them in cold water with Baby Dreft detergent, hung them to dry and rotated the 3 covers that we have.   ---  --- While it is a nice product while it lasts, I just expected them to be more durable. 
Early Louis Malle film based on the true life story of Per Jacques.  The film brings to life an understanding of true martyrdom.  This is the stuff of saints such as Maximilian Kolbe, Edith Stein, and Pere Jacques
I have uninstalled SystemWorks 2006 and will not be going back to Symantec products. I had three problems: ---  --- 1. On initial install of SystemWorks in January 2006, the "GoBack" module wiped my hard drive. This was annoying and not easy to fix. ---  --- 2. I reinstalled (and had to reregister) without the GoBack module and used the software for several months satisfactorily. A few annoyances: CleanUp consistently (every night) deleted cookies and autofills I wanted to keep, so despite my entering them as exceptions in the options table, they kept disappearing. ---  --- 3. I wanted to move to a faster hard drive. After following the Norton Ghost directions explicitly (and getting a "successful" message, the cloned drive would not boot up. I therefore went back to my old drive. SystemWorks required me to reinstall (and reregister). In December, after renewing my SystemWorks subscription for $49.95, I successfully cloned the disk (using EZ Gig II). Again, the only software that did not work on boot up was SystemWorks. I called customer support and was told that the server would not allow me to install on more than 3 computers. I explained the circumstances but was told "there was nothing to be done," and that I would have to buy the software again. I chose not to. ---  --- I have completely uninstalled the entire program and am now enjoying faster performance from the operating system and quicker boot times from Word, Photoshop, etc. The protections I was getting from SystemWorks are being covered by AVG AntiVirus (shareware), Registry Mechanic (shareware), SpyBot (shareware), and DiskKeeper ($30), and Microsoft's Malware Guard (free). ---  --- I have been using Norton/Symantec products for over 15 years. Never again
I have owned a pair of these a year or more and have probably laundered them 30-40 times.  They are very comfortable for me, though comfort is highly variable for each person.  The material is light weight but appears of good quality and I do not detect any deterioriation. At first I was concerned about the elastic which appeared narrow and weak, but it still feels as strong as when new and holds fine.  I will purchase more of these to have in a mix of styles. ---  --- About the same time as I purchased these boxers I purchased a couple pair of Faconnable boxers at about twice the price with similarly light weight material.  One pair of these ripped recently. My experience is the CK material is holding up better than the Facconable that costs twice as much. ---  --- I doubt these will elicit much commentary from significant or potentially significant others
I have been using Norton Anti-Virus since I purchased the Compaq Presario 4000. The reason I have stuck with Norton because this Presario came with Norton Internet Security 2002 attached to it. I never used the NIS 2002, though, but I purchased the Norton Anti-Virus (NAV) 2003 which I have bee using for the last three years. In fact I used the NAV 2004 for two straight years without any response from Symantec, then all of a sudden that subscription was eventually retired by Symantec. I liked the NAV 2005 (which Symantec six months prior to its due date subscription, which made me mad and hence my wanting to try NIS at a subsidized rate) because like NAV 2003, it could tell if someone or something was trying to intrude into your computer. It is after purchasing and trying NIS 2005, that I realized how low and base Norton can go with its software. First when I tried NIS 2005, it blocked all my websites. I couldnt access them and I could not read my e-mail (Whenever I tried to read my e-mail, the response would be that, that action has been cancelled). So I reformatted my hard drive and the NIS 2005 appeared to be working quite well until I tred to install Adobe Reader 7.08 and couldn't allow me to proceed. Moreover, it was snail slow in allowing me to read one mail to another. So I uninstalled NIS 2005 and installed NAV 2006, which appears to be working well. I have now purchased Tend Micro PC-cillin 2006 as well as McAfee Viruscan 2006 at subsidized rates, should Symantec pematurely terminate my NAV 2006 prematurely i.e. before the 366 days of subscription are over. I think one of the reasons why NIS could not work is that it is a program that it is trying to do more than it can chew. It tried to be an anti-virus, personal firewall, privacy control, antispam as well as parental control in one. It reminds of the days when it was better to purchase a cassette player separate from  the radio, since the technology at that time could not produce a good combined raio cassette player. I think Norton Internet Security is in that mode. It is not yet competent to produce a combined solution that is both antivirus and anti spam,anti-spyware at the same time. Hence the many complaints of its being a buggy program. At this stage, I would stay away from any program that calls itself "Internet Security." I may try Trend Micro internet Security which has received rave reviews from a couple of its users, but that will be if something goes wrong with my current NAV 2006. Otherwise, I am still wary of those programs that pass off as "Internet Security" such as "Norton Internet Security" or "Trend Micro Internet Security," pending their perfection of this technology at some future date
Very happy with our camera! Perfect condition and quick arrival
Edited Review:  My first order came with leaking jars.  Amazon replaced and the second order arrived in good condition.  The one star, which I can't seem to change, reflected that fact.  My updated review is three stars. ---  --- I was mildy disappointed in this topping.  Out of the jar, the black olives and the artichokes provide a flavor that has definate sour notes.  The texture of the ingrediants was pasty (as opposed to chunky).  I would have given this only two stars if this was supposed to be a pasta sauce.  However, I followed the directions on the jar to create their version of Bruschetta.  It is acceptable.  Since this is billed as a "topping" I am willing to give it three stars since in that capacity to performs at a pleasurable level. ---  --- The Vodka sauce is much more to my liking. ---  ---  ---  ---  ---         ---  --- 
This razor is not worth the money. It did shave pretty well for a few months, but the rubber strips wear out really quickly. And, even though the "cleaning option" with the fluid seems like a great idea... it does not work very well... the razor was never clean... and refilling the fluid is just a pain... I would not recommend this razor
 I got this movie in a three DVD pack from a local dealer, it came along with the movies Eaten Alive and Massacre in Dinosaur Valley.  I'd have to say that all three movies were worth the $15 dollars I spent on the three-pack.  The movie, Jungle Holocaust, is an adventure movie in a different spin.  I dont really consider this a horror movie, at least in the conventional sense.  The movie is exceptionally well done in the development of cinematography, the storyline is interesting and the acting and er...scenes...are engrossing (to use a phrase).  What I would really call this is an anthropological adventure to the extreme...a civilized man placed in a totally uncivilized surroundings.  Communications are not what you would get off the local street corner, worldviews are nonexistent (at least to the tribe in this film), so there is no connection except savagery.  Maybe this movie would have a greater tie with Golding's "Lord of the Flies."  A fascinating movie that brings you to the heart of a world that we, especially in first world countries like the US, have forgotten about.  I would suggest "End of the Spear" as a Christian look at examining these prehistoric people.  That film isn't a horror film, it is a Christian film, but it is (as I am a Christian) an interesting exploration of meeting such tribal people on their own territory. 
This is probably one of the best booster packs out there. Every monster that comes in the pack has an effect. Effect monsters can be very useful. Not to mention that my very first Pharaonic Guardian pack came with a secret rare! That is one of only two of the most rare cards in the whole pack! Even the common cards are great. Such as Giant axe mummy or the Gravekeeper cards! Your deck cannot be complete without this booster pack! I highly suggest this pack
The medicine ball was ordered for a gift and when it arrived, it was very scuffed up and scratched.  It also had a flat spot on it.  I returned it for a replacement, which I got, and it was in the same condition.  Also the packaging was tore as if it had been opened before.  I  would recommend buying in a store so you can look at it.  We also had the same experience above with the 6 lb. medicine ball and the same outcome.  Definitly not happy with it
Got a dud.  Lights flash (constantly) but not a peep out of it.  Has an email address, wrote for suggestions twice, also no response.  But the mail was delivered so I can only assume they're playing dead (or playing with one that works)!  Big let down
I bought this for my three yr old and it does not work at all.  We have the Britax Roundabout carseat and there is not enough room for the pillow.  I returned it
Even someone who isn't a dedicated/hardcore fan of the Halo series can appreciate the beautiful art and all the work that went into designing this game. Worth every penny
An incredibly refreshing drink when iced! Mix in a teaspoon of honey while your tea is warm and then pour over a generous amount of ice. Because of the ice, use two bags and steep for three minutes or more depending on your taste. You will be pleasantly surprised
the Jo is a popular fighting weapon in the orient.  It doubles as a fancy walking stick and can be displayed in a house as an artifact.  Getting hit with this would probably be like getting hit with a brick because it is approximately an inch in diameter.  this is a long weapon with some weight to it so it is best used for thrusting or using ones own motions against them.  I had a friend who perhaps put it best when he said " I never thought paying 20 bucks for a stick could be such a good deal "
This product is excellent. Has not malfunctioned like some other brands where info becomes inaccessible after some time. --- Good perfromanc
I bought this album after hearing America, their single off this album, and listening to the increasing hype about Razorlight and Johnny Borrell being one of the most talented singer-songwriters of his generation. This follow up is a thorough disappointment compared to their first. It's not bad, but it's not that good either. The songs all sound like I've heard them somewhere before, and the lyrics - well, how many times have we heard popstars going on about waiting by the phone, nothing on the radio, and not known what it all meant, while smoking cigarettes late at night. Yawn...
Im no Pro but once you get these bongos and tune them, they sound nice. I jam on them all the time and the quality gets better and better as the skins thin out, the sound comes out a lot more. Definitely worth 20 bucks
I live in a apt in nyc, so roaches are very common problem. After a long battle I finally got rid of the roaches in my place, but I cannot escape the bugs visiting from other apartments. I thought this device could help with that problem. Also, I don't like to use the spray too often or have all the baits, gels, and other poisons around, so I decided to try these things. Unfortunately, they don't work. The first week I bought them I saw a big roach crawl under the door and walk directly under the repeller straight to the dining room. The ultrasonic frequency did nothing to it. Instead of this repeller I use Limonel (orange peel oil) is a safe alternative to use when children are present, and it does repell and kill the bugs. --- So, how to get rid of roaches? Seal every crack nook and cranny with expansive foam, wood sealer, etc. Mine came in through the bathroom and kitchen vents, so I put mosquito screens to block their way in, also I sealed the gaps between the wall and the electrical outlets in the apt with silicone and I bought a plastic stripe that closes the gap between the door and the floor. Also, my husband sprays once every 4 months with repellent. Good luck
I found this CD by browsing Amazon and decided to give it a try.  I am happy with all of the tracks.  Some tracks remind me of Beatles a little, but not all, so the band does have a unique sound.  Even though from the 90s, the sound is like many bands making it today.  I like it.
I can't believe how much amazon and other retail stores (like sephora)charge for this.  I buy Prevage MD (which is double the strength of regular Prevage) from my plastic surgeon's office and I only pay 120$.  Why would you pay 30 dollars more for something that is only half the strength of the good stuff?  If you don't want to go to the doctor to buy the MD version, then you can get it off ebay for around 100$..
A playground for the mind. Covers a wide range of subjects. Each review is a full essay on the subject of the book. Many reviews compare and contrast several recently published books on the same subject. Learned and sophisticated yet fully accessible. An on-going liberal arts education and the easiest way I know to keep the eclectic learning that a liberal arts education aspires to
American Photo is a much better magazine than its sibling Popular Photography, but frankly, that is not saying much. It seems as though its primary market is fashion/glamour photographers since most of its issues are devoted to these aspects of professional photography. There are other magazines which excel at nature photography, so I am not disappointed by its absence here, but not noting more fine art documentary photograhy is a major omission which I hope this magazine does address eventually. There are also excellent photo equipment reviews frequently written by working professionals, as opposed solely to in-house technical equipment overviews. American Photo is without question among the better photo magazines currently available, but unless you are interested mainly in fashion and glamour photography, you might wish to look more closely at Shutterbug or other magazines devote to nature and fine art photography
First off. The knife is great. I wouldn't expect anything less from swiss army. only bad part about the knife is that the altimeter has an accuracy error margin of about 75%. And since this is both the title of the knife and the main feature of it, I give the knife a two. Only because you can get a knife just like it without the altimeter that works just as well. 
Considering you get at least twice as much jerky per dollar than the other brands out there this is a good pick.  I didn't find any grit in it.  It might have a few pieces that are tougher but not really even that tough.  This is a good deal
I'm not a good photographer but use my cameras for vacation/backpacking pictures.  The P3 was the fourth point and shoot Nikon camera my family has owned.  One of the previous cameras had the lens quit woking probably because it got some dirt in it.  On the P3 the lens extends out pretty far when the camera is turned on.  I accidently dropped it from about 30" off the ground when it was only a few days old.  It landed on the back but flipped over on to the lens.  The outer ring of the lens ended up crooked and would not retract or focus. I sent it back to Nikon and as I expected they said the repair would not be covered by warranty.  They charged $162.50 to fix it.  MasterCard has a program called "Purchase Assurance" that will hopefully cover the repair cost!   ---  --- The other night I saw a commercial on TV for an Olympus camera that could be dropped from 5 feet, get wet, or even frozen down to 14 degrees F and still take pictures.  I wish I had seen that ad first.   --- The Nikon takes great pictures but is way too fragile for a small point and shoot camera.  Not buying Nikon anymore. 
I RECEIVED A CD, THE TANGO CD( THE BEST TANGO ALBUM IN THE WORLD EVER) WAS DEFECTUOUS, SINCE IT PLAYS ALRIGHT  UNTIL THE 12TH SONG, BUT THEN THE SONGS STARTS GIVING WEIRD TONES. AND THE 2ND CD ACTS THE SAME WAY, SINCE MY TANGO ALBUM IS A DOUBLE CD.THE PROBLEM IS NOT FROM THE RADIO, SINCE MY OTHER PURCHASE FROM AMAZON IS IN GOOD SHAPE, AS AL MY OTHER CDS. --- THE MUSIC ALWAYS STOPS PLAYING RIGHT AT THE SAME TIME OF THE CD, THE 12 TH SONG, SO ITS PRETTY MUCH A CD PROBLEM. --- I DUNNO WHATS THE REFUND POLICY, OR CUSTOMER SERVICE NUMBER, ITS SO BAD , COS THIS TANGO CD IS GREAT. I ENJOYED IT MUCH , UNTIL......... --- TH
Most people can't get enough of this movie. I even own it on laserdisc. When I saw that there was a 20th anniversary edition availible on DVD, I had to have it. --- I am sorely disappointed in the video transfer quality. It lookslike there was just a transfer from VHS to DVD. There doesn't seem to be any attempt to remaster the video and clear it up or improve the audio quality. I recently saw it on HDNet Movies and thought it looked much better. ---  --- DO buy this movie because it is an all time classic. --- Don't buy this movie if you think that the 20th Anniversary edition is going to get you anything better
Marvel: Ultimate Alliance is an action/RPG that features the largest roster of comic book characters ever seen in a video game. Players assume the roles of more than 20 Marvel Super Heroes including Spider-Man, Wolverine, Blade and Captain America, and through their actions determine the fate of both planet Earth and the Marvel universe ? revealed in one of multiple epilogues.  ---  --- Marvel: Ultimate Alliance offers total team customization, where players create their own team name, icon and vehicle, as well as establish their team reputation as they play throughout the story. Gamers also have the option to level up each character individually to their liking, or all team members at the same time to keep their heroes balanced. With the game's new combat system, players battle against the world's most notorious Marvel Super Villains in the air, underwater, and on the ground, using grappling, blocking and dodging moves, by charging up their Super Hero powers before unleashing them, and using environmental objects as one and two-handed weapons. Marvel: Ultimate Alliance features a storyline where the missions players accept, the objectives they complete, and their interactions with other characters throughout the game directly impact how the story plays out.  ---  --- 
I bought this chair because of the great reviews, I hesitated at spending so much, but figured that all the features would be worth it considering my son would be using it for a couple of years.  --- Pros: --- I like that I can roll it around to the table, or to the sink to clean up after meals. The height adjustment is easy and convenient.  --- The cons: --- Folding it up didn't quite work as I thought it would. It didn't lock into the folding postition...and didn't really save that much space. I would prop it against the wall, and hope that no one knocked it down. We finally stopped folding it up. The toys that connect to the tray were too dangerous for my son, as he would usually hit himself in the face with them when he was younger, by the time he was older, I didn't really need them. The battery operated toy has a funny smell to it whenever it's been running for a while. He did like it...but the buttons were too hard for him to press when he was younger. My son discovered at 7 months how to pull off the extra tray that can go into the dishwasher, so we don't use that. He's 13 months now, and last week discovered how to disconnect the tray itself and fling it off of the high chair. I washed the seat cover per the instructions, and half the time did not use the dryer, even though it said it could go into the dryer, and now the seat is bubling and cracking...I have to place a cloth diaper in the seat to protect my son's legs. If I had not spent $90.00 on the chair I would not be as disappointed...but he's only used it for 7 months.
I read this book several months ago, and I still can't shake the feeling of having read a very, very good book. The effect of Yourcenar's words still lingers. ---  --- The text is an imagined valedictory letter or speech from emperor Hadrian to his successor. The emperor himself is dying, and faces a world that he is about to leave behind. He recalls his life, from being a young boy in his native Spain, to his ascension to the highest public post imaginable, that of emperor of Rome. Just as his professional career was incredible, so is the generosity and candidness of his "confession". There is seemingly no secret nook left untouched from his personal life.  ---  --- In the end, having cast that final weight, his conscience, from off his shoulders, the emperor is at last able to turn away from one world and face another - that of the gods.    --- 
I purchased these about 1 month ago and used the "burn in" method of leaving my Grado running music for 6 days straight to open up the components in the headphones for good sound and was VERY impressed. I do have to say that they are a bit uncomfortable at first but its worth it for the good sound and the fact that the pads adjust and soften up after a while. It's also no where near as painful as my ordeal with my first pair of canalphones which were the E2c's(see my other reviews). ---  --- Anyways...on the subject of sound I have to say that its an all around winner with its smooth but punchy bass and its open soundstage which I guess results from the open ear design they have, and although some don't like the retro look of these phones I've really been gettin into them as of late, another big plus are the rotating cups and the thick cable which guarantee's a long life for these cans. I also gotta give Grado credit on it's expandability with amps and different cups which will leave me hunting  for new components seeing as I'm merely just a budding audiophile with a long way to go and a limited budget that wont let me upgrade my setup whenever I want(cries)... ---  --- P.S. ---  --- If you use these with your computer and there are pops and hisses its because the Grado are too good for the card which resulted in me buying a new 24bit external sound card from creative that gave me a REAL boost in sound quality. So overall these are a good pair of cans for someone who loves their music but just can't afford to buy the latest and greatest in the world of sound
People are always focusing on the 2%, but what about the 98%? ---  --- I mean, really....98% is like a 790 on the SAT or an A+ in school or a 3.99 on a 4.00 scale. A 98 is really, really good....just like this milk, the 128 oz. of Tuscan 2% milk in the plastic jug. ---  --- But you gotta wonder about the price, I mean, they get the cream for the butter right? You gave up some of your whole milk delights for someone else's butter so I think we should get a price break or something. Or maybe some kind of gift certificate when Tuscan Butter is finally available online
We've had this printer for almost two years. I do a good amount of printing, both color & b/w. While I do need to do cleanings more often with this printer, mine is not sucking up ink at an unreasonable rate at all. And it is very affordable. Photos don't always print well... the only photo paper I have found to work well with my S530D was very the glossy trial pack that came with it when I bought it. No other photo paper has done well at all, so I suggest theirs. This is the best printer we have had in 10 years, and belive me I've thrown my share out the window! I can offer THIS advice to owners of ANY printers. Always use the power switch ON THE PRINTER to turn it on off, never use the power strip switch, or the switch from properties. For some reason doing so supposedly wastes ink? I don't get it, but I've always followed that advice and this printer has been an absolute gem for us. Good Luck! Jeanni
I love this soundtrack! It stands alone as beautiful, haunting, alluring, and innocent--just as Griet herself was in the film. Desplat perfectly captured the spirit of the story, enhanced and deepened a plot that was less than stellar. ---  --- Scarlett Johanssen's acting is superb, as well as Essie Davis and Colin Firth. The story, though, was a bit tired--pretty housemaid/jealous wife/do-nothing husband. Its portrayal of Vermeer and his wife was a disservice to the real people, even though it is a fictionalized account. ---  --- The two best tracks on this album are 'Griet's Theme' and 'Colours in the Clouds'. While I'm not keen on seeing the film again, this soundtrack is a treasure. It's a real work of art, second only to Vermeer's work
Obviously, from all the reviews, this book appeals to many people.  I am not one of them.  Perhaps it's because I don't care for science fiction.  I found the writing stilted, the footnotes distracting to the point I stopped bothering with them, the story boring, and the ending (covered in the introduction) to be a Twilight Zone cliche.  If, like me, you want to read the book because it has some connection to bicycles and cycling you will be disapppointed. 
This is my favorite cereal, I recommend it to everyone I can.  I eat a bowl every morning at 9 am and am still full at lunch time.  Best of all, it tastes great.  I agree with previous reviewer that the flax seeds are tasty, but probably useless as the body can't break down a whole flax seed to obtain the Omega-3, but it adds nice texture and nuttiness.  Also, Amazon has a great price on this vs. grocery stores
The plot of the story was ruined by the immorality and language.   This could have been a beautiful story if sexual immorality and profane language had been eliminated.   It is possible to have something beautiful and clean where when you finish you feel that you have experienced something encouraging and uplifting.   Dying Young and the plot of sickness and someone caring is beautiful.  Falling in love is beautiful but it is degraded by stooping to immorality.   I threw it in the trash as I would not share it with those that I love
The overall package is well built and well documented.  The installation was straightforward and only took about 30 minutes to get up and running.  It does work, but, if you are like me, most of your tapes are getting pretty old and are not in the greatest of shape, sound-wise. Because the software lacks any capabilities to perform sound leveling and noise reduction, your resulting .mp3s that are all over the place, sound-wise. ---  --- As a cheap work-around, get the WindowsXP Plus! Digital Media Edition.  The Analog Recorder works well enough and is simple to use.  Plus it is only $15 to download.  You can use it with the plusdeck to play your tapes and provide input and then use the analog Recorder to actually record the files and convert to .mp3.  If you get a tape player with a line out, you can connect your tape player right to the back of your computer and accomplish the same without the Plusdeck2c
Noam Chomsky has thrived greatly in this great country of his, yours, and mine - the United States of America.  He has made millions of dollars teaching, lecturing, selling his books, and investing.  His world-wide fame in psycholinguistics is well-deserved.  His infamy is merited for his lack of loyalty to his own Jewish ethnicity and the U.S., in spite of the fruits he has received by being a citizen of the United States.  He has repaid this country in bile with his incredibly biased analysis of American foreign policy.  He goes way beyond a balanced multiculturism, when he always ranks the U.S. and Israel as foremost among the terrorist forces in the world now, and even in history.  His distrust of any authority, benign or otherwise, is reflected in his dogmatic and unexamined support of the "underdog," even if that underdog is a suicide bomber or a major terrorist organization such as Al Queda or Hezbollah.   ---  --- Yet since 1955, hypocrite Chomsky has worked for the "overdog" Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which has actively and enthusiastically participated in the development of weapons of War and mass destruction, and continues to this very day. ---  --- Chomsky trumps his own potential for gifted analytic objectivity with his simple hatred of the United States and the Jewish State. ---  --- If he were not so attached to the freedom of making money, earning the adulation of the American Left, and freedom to express himself, he might be able to give more direct and personal support for our enemies and his friends by taking up residence in North Korea, Iran, or Syria.  Let us hope he retires outside of our homeland that he hates so much, the United States of America.   ---  --- God Bless America, which will continue to give Chomsky the right to speak, teach, and make lots of money. ---  --- Raybo
I love the xbox 360,I got it about 2 months ago.I remember my friend saying wait for the ps3,i told him im not waiting for that overhyped overpriced system.The xbox 360 live is amazing and is so much fun.The graphics and sound are great to.I dont have an hd tv either but you can tell a great deal of difference(you need real cables people.dont use the cheap ones that come with it and use the components not the stupid yellow video plug).The wireless controllers are great.the main thing are games,theres good ones and bad ones,choose very wisely.But there alot of good ones right now to choose from.And make sure you get the xbox with the 20 gig hard drive,theres no other way to have it
I just love our snack trap cups!  My 19 month old has been using them for 4 or 5 months and enjoys "doing it himself".  They're great for shopping, driving, or anywhere!  ABSOLUTELY NO SPILLS!  Highly reccommend this product! ---  --- -Happy mom of 1 so fa
The musical was a virtual voyage back to my childhood when I saw it for the first time. My husband is no "square" and he enjoyed it all. Seniors would love to see it again.  The film was obviously preserved well and the color was enriched beautifully for this dvd
This thing is great. Anything you can put on top of it to hold it down will stage it up to go off. It will blow up and not hurt anyone but scare them...funny funny funny!!!! You can use fairly light objects, you can use trip cords, and you can use trip cord like devices too, and probably much more that I have never thought of... Good luck, good fun, and good hunting! ---  --- Sam Kochel... ---  --- p.s. hope this was a helpful review
My husband is Icelandic, and unfortunately this book was NO help at all... It's perfectly fine for the traveller, but in trying to live everyday life, conversing with new family members forget it. I would have liked to have seen a more comprehensive grammatical section, something that was laid out in something easy to look at and understand. If you are quite serious about learning this language I would honestly recommend saving the 20 bucks and buying the bit more expensive Colloquial Icelandic.  For me at least, it's quite easier to understand, has complete grammatical charts in the back, as well as a fairly decent dictionary...  Again, if you are only learning for business trips and such, then this would be a good option... For those of us actually moving there, her book is not so good..
I don't know where Amazon got these cases of All Small & Mighty, Free Clear.  I use the same product all the time purchased from my local superstores and grocery stores and love it.  From my local retailers the product has no scent and is the consistency of shampoo.  The Amazon case is gelatinous and smells like latex paint.  It also disturbed me that the bottles are packaged differently than the local store version.  At the store they have a shrink wrap label and a large cap for a dripless spout.  The Amazon case has sticker labels on the same shape bottle and a small cap on a non-dripless spout.  At first I called the manufacturer.  Their customer service seemed concerned but then managed to drop my call.  So I decided to use it.  I do not notice any difference in the cleanliness level of my clothes.   ---  --- I would not purchase this again from Amazon.  The price is not that great to overcome the odd differences.  I will, however, continue to purchase this product from my local retailers
Coat was of VERY cheap quality. The fur around hood was matted. No way I would wear or recommend this coat.  It went staight to Good Will. I guess you get what you pay for.  Unless it is free you are paying too much
This door gym is incredible. I have been getting great workouts with this. My arms, chest, back, and shoulders have all been noticably improved within a week. Great workout. Throw in a few miles of running and you have no excuse not to be ready for summer
Great set of earrings at a very nice price.  Thanks
Tales from the crypt as you might know is the popular horror series that was on HBO during the early ninties so this film is the first movie to be made from that series. The film is absolutley fantastic and has alot of gore, nudity and humor in it unfortunately the sequal that was released after this was terrible and wasn't even worth it anyway the film starts of with a small segment where the cryptkeeper is directing a horror film then tells his usual stuff like some lame jokes then the real film starts with a car chase and offcourse Billy Zane as the collector was fantastic in his role he was hillarious and scary at the same time, William Sadler plays Brayker who is a drifter that stumbles upon a motel and its inhabitants and is trying to hide from the collector who happens to want a medalion that Brayker has, the collecter also summons up some demons from hell in a very cool scene so he could create alot of havoc, the film was also an homage to older horror films like the evil dead and night of the living dead as you'll see later when the characters are all stuck in this motel surrounded by demons. All the characters were great in this film and you also get a bit of background with each one of them which is rare especialy in a gory horror film like this. The film also stars Jada Pinket Smith, CCH Pounder who gets her arm ripped off in this film and Thomas Haden Church who plays the obnoxious jerk and some other actors that I don't recognise all this makes for a great and enjoyable horror film that I highly recomend that you watch
I think coffee taste is more of a personal preference, but I was not fond of this decaf coffee.  I always drink my coffee black and I didn't get the rich coffee taste that I like with the Don Francisco brand.  Illy has a great reputation so I am guessing their non-decaf coffee is outstanding, they just need a little work with the decaf
The author not only argues for feminism, but she does so in a unique manner, and innovative approach by arguing for feminism across borders.  She compares and defines literary and national borders.  This book is extremely thorough on all aspects of Chicana feminist writing available, by engaging historical theories as well as contemporary notions.  To really grasp the experience, the author has certainly covered her basis in terms of depth, substance, truth and validity.  
I am 23 years old and this game hasn't left my DS since I bought it a month ago. It's incredibly fun. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes fast paced minigames. You get rated bronze, silver, or gold for your cooking. I love these weird japanese games! I only gave it 4 stars overall because there is not a lot of replay value once you have received gold on all 74 or so recipes. I heard they are making a Wii version of cooking mama, so I'm hoping that one will have more recipes
we bought this when my daughter was newborn, and we were surprised that her peg perego car seat fit into it so well, now shes a year and a half and even if were at home she climbs into it and plays with the steering wheel. She has always loved it, in the snow and on the ground and on picnics, its great, a lot better than plastic wheels, the front tire swivels and also has a little switch so that it becomes more like a jogging stroller and the front wheel doesnt move. Weve really liked it so far, except for the harness not fitting a very tiny baby, its GREAT. the only thing is now i have 2 kids and i cant use it cause i need a double on
My husband liked his slippers I got him for Christmas.  He said that they were warm and soft
So far the device has entirely lived up to expectations.  Atomic Clock feature works fine and the range and accuracy on the remote sensor seems fair enough -- there is often about a 1-2 degree difference between the sensor and main unit if set right next to each other, but this is minor for the uses we get out of it (a quick look at outside temps during the winter). ---  --- The only issue we ran into that was "problematic" was the Ice Alarm feature.  This feature sets off the devices alarm anytime the temperature drops between 32 and 27 degrees or so to alert you to possible icy conditions.  The problem is that in cold climates the temperature hovers in that range all winter long...so the alarm goes off continually every 40 seconds or so. ---  --- We just happened upon a solution that has worked perfectly.  The ice alarm only works on Channel 1.  So, if you set the outside sensor to Channel 2 or 3 the ice alarm is disabled and is no longer triggered.  Obviously, they should have an ability to shut it off, but this is it...and even this isn't listed in the instructions
We bought this camera thinking that it would be our do-all "EuroCam" for an upcoming trip to Europe. It promised a sufficient range of performance and features to easily meet our needs on such a trip. ---   --- Sadly, the camera is not up to filling this role. We will need to take another camera along with it. However, we will take the V705 for its wide-angle lens, the reason that we picked this model in the first place. It is this disparity between the advertised and actual capabilities of the camera which prompts me to contribute this review. ---  --- The need for a true wide-angle lens is both a sufficient and a necessary condition for buying this camera. If you do not need a 23mm lens, or if you do not know if you need a 23mm lens, then you do not need this otherwise mediocre P&S (Point and Shoot) camera.  ---  --- Good: Fairly decent 23mm wide-angle lens; The 23mm is the default lens; Rapid start-up time; Internal focus and zoom; Chromatic aberration well controlled; Can use 4GB cards; Freeze-frame and extract any video frame. ---  --- Mediocre: Soft images; Perceptible shutter lag; Slow shot-to-shot times; Exposure compensation is easy, but steps are too small for digital, and is reset when camera turned off; Flash does not come close to covering the 23mm; Image numbering basically limited to 4 digits; Flimsy construction; No manual controls; No RAW format; No optical viewfinder; Histogram on display, but too small to be useful. ---  --- Bad: The Absolute Worst menu system to be found on a camera; Excessive and unadjustable JPEG compression; Poor battery life with very expensive external charger and spare battery; Unacceptable visual noise starting at ASA-400; Forced in-camera stitching of panoramic images, with inability to save the individual panoramic shots; Panoramic component images forced to 5MP; Overlays for panoramic and delete modes are so dark they obscure the underlying image (even with display on `bright'); MPEG-4 video compression gives very poor results. ---  --- Synopsis: ---  --- If you need a 23mm lens in a point and shoot, this, and the older V570, are the only choices. ---  --- If most of your images are in bright light, the 7MP V705 gives better images. If most images will be in low light, the older, cheaper, 5MP V570 is the better choice. ---   --- The camera seems very fragile. Treat it gently and you will likely be happy with the wide-angle performance. If you chose this as your sole camera, you will likely be unhappy with your choice. ---  --- The ONLY reason to buy this camera is for the wide-angle lens.  ---  --- = = = = =  Some Expanded Comments  = = = = = ---  --- Twenty-three mm wide-angle fixed-focus lens. This lens has almost decent optical quality; though the camera's processing still produces overly-compressed and soft images from it. On power-up the 23mm is the initially active lens, which is ideal for us. However, considering that this is truly a specialty lens, it would make more sense that the `normal' lens should be the default. Best would be a menu setting to allow selection of the boot-up lens. Better yet would be a camera with only the 23mm lens. ---  --- The camera does have firmware wide-angle distortion correction. This works fairly well, at the cost of even more image softness, but even-so, barrel distortion is noticeable to a degree that is not present in actual 35mm-film camera wide-angle lenses of similar focal length. This in-camera correction can be turned off. Doing so allows one to see the marginal native lens performance. ---  --- However, being able to turn off distortion correction exemplifies for me how poorly thought out this camera is. The only people who would wish to do this are those who are exploring the artistic limits of the camera - and they would seem better served by the camera having such basics as:  manual settings, a physically larger sensor chip, RAW image files, or, at least, a choice of degree of JPEG compression. ---  --- At the other end of the camera's focal length the 114/117mm performance shows slightly below average image softness with average pincushion distortion. There are very few circumstances where one would want to use `digital zoom', so, as with all digicams, the claimed maximum telephoto length is completely bogus. After reaching optical zoom limits, one is much better off doing any further 'zooming' in an editing program. ---  --- Kodak's advertised "5X Optical Zoom" is, at best, misleading. Actually, it is just flat out untrue. The camera has two lenses. The only lens that can be optically zoomed is the 39-114mm lens, which is not quite 3:1. The wide angle lens has a fixed focal length. (Note, in some places Kodak claims 39-114, in others 39-117 optical zoom.) ---   --- Also misleading is the claimed "Anti-blur technology." As best I can tell from looking at the images, and at the EXIF metadata, all this actually means is that at some given shutter speed the camera boosts the ASA. Certainly there is no optical image stabilization technology in this camera. ---  --- Speaking of ASA. This is an opportune time to address the camera's incredibly poor menu system. It is Byzantine: being both awkward and time consuming to use. To adduce, `Auto' ASA ranges from 50-200, to set a faster (or to lock in at a slower) sensitivity rating requires going through multiple menu levels. To change from `auto' to the next fastest (400) requires 11 manipulations of 2 controls! On either of the other two P&Ss which we will be taking along it requires 4 pushes on 1 control. The menu system is next to unusable in the field. ---  --- Still on ASA settings, the camera does have sensitivities up to ASA/ISO 1000 (though the manual only documents ASAs up to 800, 1000 is available on the camera). Unless your shot is of a once-in-a-lifetime, will never-happen-again moment, then 200 is the max ASA tolerable before noise in the shadows becomes annoying. At 400 the entire image suffers from noise and is not really useable for any print larger than 4x5". ---  --- The previous version of this camera, V570, had only 5MP, but the same sensor size. By increasing the pixel count, but not the physical size of the sensor, the new V705 camera actually has more low-light digital noise than its predecessor. This has happened with many of the current P&S cameras, as the makers advertise pixel count as a measure of image quality.  My initial experience with low-light high ASA use of this camera is that you might as well set the capture size to 3 MP, as the larger files have only marginally better printing capability because of the severe noise artifact. ---  --- Another approach to dealing with the sensor noise is to use one of the commercially available products which, when calibrated to the sensor in the camera, allows the subtraction of much of the internally generated noise. Doing so does allow for semi-adequate 8x10" prints at ASA 800. If one really wants to get carried away, combining the preceding with any of the image stacking programs designed for astrophotography (where dozens/hundreds/thousands of images are averaged together) makes 8x10's at ASA 1000 doable. People willing to undertake these manipulations likely do not fit Kodak's target market. ---  --- Back to earth. ---  --- The V705's still-image quality is below average for this generation of 7MP P&S cameras. Mostly I believe this is because of the overly aggressive JPEG compression, which is not adjustable (e.g. `best', `good', etc). My guess is that a compression setting of 30-40 is being used. This results in small files, with a lot of compression artifact. The 7MP JPEGs from this camera are about 1.2-1.5MB in size, those from another 7MP P&S I have are 5-6MB. My 6MP prosumer digital SLR JPEGs are 8-10MB. The more the compression, the worse the image. Most cameras allow the user to pick the trade-off point. Kodak picks it for you, and picks poorly. ---  --- The V705's video performance is very disappointing. It uses MPEG-4 compression, and at very aggressive compression settings. Unless it is a video of your baby's first steps, or aliens landing in the backyard, you will likely find it hard to watch. The total output datastream is about 0.5 MBS. Compare this with a miniDV tape video datastream of 25 MBS (total, adding sound, error correction, and time codes, is 36 MBS). Better to have stuck with MPEG-2 which would give less compression, but decent enough (TV quality) videos. That is the choice that most manufactures have made. As a result, the videos from my other P&Ss have about a 2 MBS datastream, and so are of much better quality. ---  --- The battery. Kodak's claim is 150 still images per charge. I am getting 100-120, with minimal use of flash and the LCD on `energy saver'. Even 150 would be poor, compared with my other digital P&Ss, where I expect at least 200, and often get 250+ if I am at all careful with power-management. This camera has a proprietary (and hard to remove) 720 mAh battery. My (several) other, P&Ss have 790-1120 mAh batteries, and, I suspect, more efficient processors. ---  --- Since we are only going to be using this camera for wide-angle, the battery will likely last most of a day. We have not bought an external charger and backup battery because the cost is about 25% the cost of the camera. ---  --- Though the body is of aluminum, the camera itself is overall fragile and I doubt will hold up more than a year or two. The battery and media doors do not appear to have been designed for actual repeated use; there is no cover for the charge socket. The media door often dislodges open. ---  --- Truly, my belief is that Kodak designed this camera with the thought that these doors would never be used: that the camera would spend its life simply being taken in and out of the (not included in this model) "EasyShare" dock system. This would also explain the relatively large amount of built in memory, and the overly aggressive JPEG compression. ---  --- Shutter lag, the bête noire of digital cameras, is very evident with this model. I do not have any method of actually measuring the time between pressing the shutter, and the image being recorded. However, based on over 50 years of tripping shutters, it clearly varies, and I estimate is, at best 1/4  second, up to a bit over 1/2 second. In addition to the shutter lag, there is a perceptible lag in the LCD viewfinder screen showing what is in front of the lens. Together this makes the capture of a fleeting moment, an active child at a particular instant, or a wary animal almost impossible. The shutter lag is much more evident than in same-generation/price P&S cameras from other makers. ---  --- The accompanying `manual' is poorly organized, childishly written. "Finish reading this book, so you can take and share your best pictures!"  At best, it was written for 8 year olds. ---  --- The manual does make reference to a web-address where one can download the `full manual', however the address given is incorrect. When eventually found, the manual is better than the one enclosed with the camera - in that it contains some information that one could not figure out oneself - but it also is written at no more than a fourth grade level. ---  --- Panoramics, one of the advertising points of the camera, are another disappointment. Basically the way it works is that 2 or 3 images can be taken in `panoramic mode', each subsequent shot is overlain by a thin strip of the preceding image, in order to allow alignment. As with most `panoramic modes' focus and exposure is locked on the first image. So far, this is all OK; however, it rapidly goes downhill. ---  --- First, the max image size of the individual shots is limited to 5 (not 7) MP. Next, the image overlay is so dark that, even with the LCD set at max brightness, it is difficult to see through the mask to align the elements. ---  --- However, it gets worse. ---  --- The images MUST be joined in-camera! The individual images cannot be stored! In-camera processing is very slow and very battery hungry. Aligning the overlaps on a grainy 1.5x2" LCD in the field gives, in spite of the camera's best efforts, much poorer results than aligning them on a much bigger, and higher quality, computer display in the comfort and controlled lighting of your home. ---  --- The best way to take panoramas with this camera is to use a lightmeter to determine exposure for each segment, and then simply take the appropriate series of images as 7MP single-stills, making exposure compensation adjustments based on your light-meter readings. Of course, my smallest lightmeter is almost as large as this camera, so we will not be dragging it along. You can eyeball the needed EC close enough that should be able to match the exposures up in production. Much better if the V705 allowed the individual images to be saved. ---  --- Reading back through this review, I see that it is mostly negative. This makes sense, for, as I disclosed at the beginning, it was my disappointment in this camera's actual vs advertised capability which led me to write the review in the first place. Likely I have said all that needs to be said. ---  --- So I will just close by mentioning that the only reason we did not send the camera back is because of the wide-angle lens.  Except for this unique lens, the camera's performance and ease of use is below that of similarly priced P&S cameras currently on the market. ---  --- If you need a true wide-angle P&S, you need this camera. Otherwise forget it
this has a nice wide color screen with amazing clarity and picture quality.  Syncs to Windows PC and MS Office with ease.  Great feature is the off phone battery recharging and the included second battery.  Having one battery to recharge and using the other until the phone dies should keep the life of the battery longer.  Not having to worry about plugging in to recharge is totally awesome.  Nice to see this feature return.  When cellphone first came out this was a standard feature, then it was optional, then it was gone.  Get the extra long life battery if you plan to use this as a video or MP3 music player.  Video conversion is a bit spotty and frustrating.  Many videos will convert and then not display.  Music is no problem.  Any MP3 or MS Windows media player audio format will play.  Convert is easy with Windows Media Player 10 or 11.  Sorry Win2k users (forget NT or Win9X or Me), video conversion is not available on any MS OS older than XP and Windows Media Player 10 and 11 are only on XP.  Get a MicroSD card and put your music on that card and you can play it from there.  Pictures can also be stored on the SD card or in the 64Megs of internal memory.  Since this is a MS Smartphone, there are lots of 3rd party software and games for this phone.  Be aware of the aspect ratio, this is a landscape display and not portrait.  If you get games or applications for it be  sure of the aspect ratio.  This is a 240H by 320W display.  Size your pictures to the display and you will be happy with the clarity and sharpness.  ---  --- The thumbwheel is great for navigation and web browsing. ---  --- Niggles: --- 1. Camera is slow and not very clear, but none of the camera phones I have seen are very good either. --- 2. need more ring tones. The ones that come with this phone are lame at best.  Download or create some of your own. --- 3. Need more menu choices.  The ones that come with it are OK but take some navigation to get around. --- 4. Hate the Cingular activation policy and cost for the internet access service (but that is not the phone's fault so maybe I should not list this complaint)
This is a really fun and fashionable watch.  It has a bangle style band and can be worn slightly loose or snug.  I like the pink dial that changes color.  Depending on the angle and lighting, the dial looks pink, yellow or purple.  I also like how Fossil made the band adjustable.  Remove or add as many links as necessary.  There is no need to have the watch adjusted at the jewelry counter
This movie was ok. I do prefer The Messenger starring Milla Jovovich. Milla is exceptional in that version
  --- This game is mindnumbingly hard not because its a very challenging but rather its set up to fail.Most missions thrust you into a situation with little indication of what to do. As the patients vital signs drops, you frantically poke at your DS trying to think on what to do. The nurse, who assists you, gives you vague ideas on how and before you know it you've failed the mission. It would take me an average of 10-15 failures before I finally won a mission. The last mission I played that made me quit, resulted in 30+ failures. And that's only being 1 hour and half into the game.  ---  --- The graphics are crisp and clear. The storyline didn't make much of an impression on me. But I was probably too frustrated to pay attention to that. This game had a lot of potiental but killed it by constantly making you fail. Do not buy this game unless you have an extreme amount of patients, game collector who will keep it sealed, or you're a gultton for punishment. Whatever you do, do not buy this game for the hype. It does not live up to it. 
I am completely satisfied with this product.  Correct time is kept and it has been a great watch.  I have had many atomic wrist watches and this is the best one ever. 
The external antenna is a plastic decoration only and does not do anything functional.  False advertising
I have studied the tarot for nearly 5 years and keep an open mind whenever a new book appears on the market.  Edain McCoy, who has written some wonderful New Age material, strikes an off-putting note in this one.  The spreads are certainly imaginative and are perhaps insightful to her own method of tarot interpretation, but convey confusing and ambiguous directions to the reader who is trying to understand her card placements.  In several of her spreads she conveys that a card's placement at a certain point in the spread "may or may not" mean some karmic element at play.  The whole exercise of creating a spread is to pinpoint with a degree of accuracy the situation you wish to define.  Therefore, when a card "may or may not" mean something, that interpretation could significantly change on whether you "may or may not" interpret it that way, leaving the interpreter open to rationalizing a card's meaning.  Tarot cards are intuitive, not rational, and their meanings can best be intuited when their placement is clearly defined without ambiguity   It is difficult to have it both ways and I found working with these spreads difficult.  Imagine doing a Celtic Cross reading and the first position "may or may not" be the root of the issue.  These spreads speak very clearly to the author, but not so to the reader.  I rate it 2 stars for depth and insight into Karma and past lives, but the explanations are too ambiguous.
I really like the heart rate monitor and it works great.  As has been said, it takes some time learning all it does, but it's worth it in my opinion.  The only thing I was not real excited about was the pace jumps around quite a bit, but from what I have been told by others and their brands of running watches, they all do this to an extent.  Everything else I'm quite happy with and would highly recommend it to anyone. The distance reading has been right on the money after calibration.
This school bus was smaller than I expected, about 4 inches long. I bought it for my 3 year old son who loves school buses. He broke it in the first 5 minutes of opening the package. It's a pull-back and go car. And he pulled it back too far on the first try and it snapped the wheels. They were wobbly from then on. This toy is not for kids and it's not really for playing with from what I can tell. Very dissappointed
when i first stepped on the scale i thought i lost 10 lbs. but after reading other review i realize the scale  is off up to 9  lbs. also this is a big scale. too big to store in the bathroo
I don't know why they changed from the old layout to the new skinny vertical columns. The old planner was a lifesaver, but this new layout is unusable. They claim to be the artist's notebook, but what artist is really going to be breaking their day down hour by hour? And even if someone wanted to do that, the tiny columns are worthless. Really a shame
I'm a college kid, recreational audiophile and bass fanatic, studying engineering.  I started off building a custom sub encloser with dual Kicker CompVR 12" subs driven by a 1200W Sony amp. I haven't stopped searching for great sound since. ---  --- I'm running a pair of these off an H/K AVR240, combined with a JBL EC35 center, a JBL S120PII 400w sub, and two sets of E30 surrounds. ---  --- I'm big on trying anything before I buy it.  I was able to listen to these and the E80s (the dual 6" floorstandings) at a local audio store before they were discontinued.  I loved the sound of these and the Polk and Klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics. With the JBLs at a fraction of the price here on Amazon, it was no question.   ---  --- The only issue was what model to get... --- I heard very little difference in qualtiy between the E60s and E80s.  The dual 6" put out a bit lower frequencies, but the difference was so small that I wouldn't be able to notice without the speakers side by side.  Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful, but a bit overkill for what I needed.  I deceided on these over the E60s with the hopes that a single 8" would draw less from my amp than the dual 6" for a bit less money. ---  --- Beautiful home theater and music speaker... --- crisp highs, defined mids, and respectable bass.  They are a bit top heavy, as any tower will be.  and I love extremely low, loud bass, and as such, I suplemented the system with a sweet JBL sub. ---  --- Movies sound great: --- Saving Private Ryan, Fifth Element, 40 year old virgin, Anchorman, etc... etc... --- Music is also fantastic (with different amp settings tuned for genre): --- Ambient, electronica, hip-hop, rap, jazz, 80s, classical, rock. --- Ulrich Schnauss, Bonobo, DJ Shadow, Busta, Snoop, E40, Louis Armstrong, Michael Jackson, Bach, Korn, Metallica, Hoobastank, 311. ---  --- If you're looking for a quality tower speaker... this is it. --- Bass fanatics, look at the S120PII.  you won't regret it. --- ~shakas~ 
For the price, I shouldn't complain, but what the heck?  What ever happened to quality control?  It came double shrink wrapped.  There was a plastic handle guard that didn't fit the sword, so I had to just throw it away.  Very little pride in the product.  The wood was roughly sanded before it was painted.  Well, it's just a stick afterall.  I'm just glad I did not purchase a more expensive item from this vendor, DreamObjects.  Read their feedback responses -- sounds a lot like aggressive Ebay sellers who get their jollies replying to negative or lukewarm feedback.  Sorry -- waste of my time and a few dollars.  I gave them a 4 out of 5 feedback simply because you can't tell quality from a single digital photo
I love this product. It just tastes great especially with milk.
I love these socks. They fit great (my 15 month old daughter has thick ankles) and she can zoom around on the kitchen floor and not take a nose dive into things. :
This is a beautiful sandal but the shoe was made from really stiff and ungiving material.  The footbed was uncomfortable and not a good fit or feel to it.  The price is right but there are so many sandals with gemstones to choose from I decided to return these sandals
I was not impressed with this book.  It's worth reading only because there are so few Ruby on Rails books.  There is too much basic Ruby and not enough Rails in this book.  I much prefered the Agile Web Dev with Rails
I don't know what other people are complaining about. I just installed Vista Ultimate a few days ago and I absolutely love it. No interface lag or any other lag at all. Maybe the people complaining have weak or outdated hardware. Those people need to turn down their settings if their not going to keep their computers on the cutting edge or at least near it. I'm glad Microsoft isn't waiting for people to catch up and are on the cutting edge. I'd rather be the one catching up than the other way around. ---  --- I have a Core 2 Duo e6300 overclocked to 2.5Ghz, 2 gigs of ram, a Geforce 7600gt and a Western Digital Raptor X 150g HD and Vista Ultimate works flawlessly on my computer. It's not the best computer but it runs flawlessly, I built it myself and all the parts cost me about $850 off the net. I play World of Warcraft among some other games and I haven't seen any problems yet with any games or any of the major software I use as of yet. I've only encountered one problem and that was with my old Soundblaster Live! 5.1 sound card which has discontinued support. No big deal, it was about time to get a better one anyway.
I have eaten this amazing cereal every morning for a year and I still look forward to eating it.  It has an interesting flavor that I know I will never get tired of.  I highly recommend trying it
I would have rated this item 0 stars, if that were an option.  We discovered approximately a year after installing these that the plastic strap had become so brittle that it snapped in two with little manipulation.  Fortunately, we discovered this because we were moving, not because a piece of furniture fell.  I shudder to think what might have happened if our furniture had tipped
This new version of Illustrator is great, glad I upgraded! The Live Trace feature is cool
The Keyboard Protector fits very well on my MacBook, but in the end I got tired of how much slower my typing was when I used the protector. It claims it doesn't slow down your typing speed at all, but it really does; you have to push on the keys harder when you type and for me it took a concsious effert to do so. As I'm typing this review now, I'm not using my protector anymore. If you don't mind how it slows down your typing, then go ahead and get it.
I got this as well under the assumption that it wasnt a high end watch.  After wearing Invicta's for a while this feels like a gum wrapper on my wrist. ---  --- When I received it, I noticed the small scratches all over the crystal.  Nothing deep, but they really pick up the glare.  ---  --- Atomic signal, I am unable to get it to pick up one.  In Memphis, TN, I think I should be in range, and all my atomic clocks sync up fine.  I have tried it facing 4 different directions and also tried it outside to eliminate any interference from the house.  Still no good. ---  --- Basically I spent 30 dollars for a cheap watch that doesnt even have a backlight.  Lesson learned
Working out used to be heh for me, but after getting the door gym I made a rule. Anytime I enter my bathroom (which is where it is suspended) either before or after I have to do 10 Pull-ups and 10 Neutral pull-ups, also since I purchased the broad-reach 10 of those as well. It's working wonders, within the first week of doing pull-ups where i'd use my legs just enough to complete the pull-up I'm now able to do 10 regular pull-ups. I'm very happy with this product, only downside (which I personally don't really care about) is that depending on what kind of door frame you have you could get some denting on the front side, the backside works just fine and leaves no marks on your walls. So anyway... I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a quick and depending on how hard you want to work :P easy workout
This is fun and a good idea, but the quality of the stand and the plastic is very poor.  It fell apart the first time we had it up, and while you can put it back together, unless you want to be doing it every ten seconds, it isn't worth it.  The keyboard itself is fine. The microphone overpowers the keyboard music and has no volume on it, but the keyboard does.  The microphone stand is really cheap plastic and broke right away.  I would suggest buying a cheap keyboard and microphone and just using it on a table instead, or if you buy this product, don't expect to use the keyboard stand for long, but it can work without it
Nick Xu, if you can't figure out the difference between this lens, and the cheaper consumer grade lenses, by all means, stay with the cheaper consumer grade lenses. After all, "Mr Magoo" of cartoon fame couldn't tell a Chevy from a Rolls Royce. All kidding aside, this lens is simply awesome in use. Having one of these lenses in a camera bag is very close in practice to owning three or four high end prime lenses. Yes, it's that good.  ---  --- I am using a borrowed version right now, but as soon as I pay off my new 24-105 f/4 L IS USM lens (very, very awesome), I will buy my own  70-200 f/2.8 IS USM. It's as good as it gets in this lens range, but if you feel comfortable with a pinhole camera, carry on, as it's all about the end user. ---  --- For everyone else, this lens is the Holy Grail of mid range telephoto lenses. It is simply the best available in it's range, and responds well to Canon tele adapters. If you can figure out a way to afford this lens, buy it, as it is all that. If you are a Nikon lover buy this lens anyway, and buy a fairly cheap 20D body to make it work. It's OK to tell your friends that you used a Nikon to take the pics, but you will end up knowing that Canon is the premeir lens crafter of the 21'st century. ---  --- (Sorry, Nikon fans, but this lens stands all by it's self in the grand scheme of things. It's simply awesome.)
It is extremely easy to use.  Hard to figure out the menu, but once that is done there is no problem. Takes beautiful pictures.  Great for action shots as well.  Seldom find a blurry photo as it has a stabelizer built in
The environment of this movie was so unusual for me, since I know virtually nothing of the Maiori culture, I was enthralled with this movie
I'm a first home buyer so with the nice weather coming up i decided that i needed a grill... so I wanted something that I could smoke too so the char broil smoker seemed like the ideal grill. assembly was simple. took about 30 min. I highly recommend using sockets and also using two different types of screw drivers a bigger bit size #3 and a #1 that will make the job easier. Also, I just bought mine at walmart for $79.00. Havent used it yet but the concept seems simple enough. Probably only be able to fit 2 slabs of ribs on it. so cooking for a huge group wont be possible.
This cardigan doesnt have proper buttonholes just cut slits that are both ugly and will not last long. The texture went bobbly after one day near the arms
where are all of my magazine subscription first issues??????? ---  --- mar
The camera has really amazing features. But it also has an outrageously major focus weekness. I made a mistake of buying one
This notebook case is a perfect fit for the MacBook, and it is compact enough to fit into larger bags.  It is exactly what I was looking for
The pen is really great.  I'm a big fan of the gel pens, but they smudge really easy even after they dry for a couple seconds.  The pen also writes very nice.  Its different to work with a pen that has some square edges.  Its easy to over come. --- The pen is rather expensive, but its great that the refills are inexpensive
I just bought this through Amazon and then put it together pretty quickly.  Packaging was lousy, as others have already mentioned, and 3 pieces were either missing or broken, so I had to call for them.  First customer service rep was ok, but the next day I found the pedal crank making a sound, and called back, but the next rep claimed that I put the pedals on wrong and refused to exchange the main part containing the gears.  I held up the phone to the machine so he could hear it, and he acknowledged hearing the noise, but said I would have to open up the unit and identify the broken or loose piece on my own.  The unit came w/ that part already sealed, so I don't know how they can expect me to spend my time playing maintenance technician on their product.  Although the product appears to be engineered well, any company that's not willing to correct their mistakes deserves a negative rating
TANGLED IS ACTUALLY A REALLY GOOD MOVIE. YOU HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION OR YOU'LL GET LOST IN THE PLOT BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT WAS A GREAT MOVIE
This potty seat is the only toilet training item I have bought. I highly recomend it! My daughter thinks she is a big girl on the big potty. You need a step stool for them to get up on their own. I like that the seat is sturdy enough to withstand a 30 lb. 3 ft. 2 yro. climbing up & situating her self with out my help because ultimatly that is the goal & this product I feel helps get to that goal.
We found the system very hard to read. At night we couldn't see it at all to read it. Our family bought us the better model for Xmas, so we are going to put this one on ebay. Would not recommend it
within two weeks the hose connection was leaking.  the manufacturer never responded when i contacted the
--as I found it to be really much too fake-lemony, not unlike the stuff you smell in car dealership service bathrooms. I mixed mine w/ a subtle "cookie"-type one I coudn't smell at all & now can smell neither, even when I put them in closets, which was not the idea--I like a little fragrance thru the house. May look for something like cinnamon or sandalwood
I originally purchased the Samsung DUOCAM SCD6040.  It fortunately broke 1 week before the warranty ran out.  The video began having giant pixilated squares when video taping and on playback.  Though under warranty, it still cost me $49 (their fee) to send in the camera for a repair.  The repaired camera came back broken.  I had to deal with many customer service people, but finally got them to agree mine was a "lemon" and they sent me the SCD6550.  Now 10 months later, the video and playback on this duocam has broken.  You see a black screen with yellow blocks on the LCD and through the viewfinder.  I cannot video tape or playback anything on tape.  It is not under warranty.  I can't believe their cameras/duocams don't last longer than one year.  They must use cheap parts.  PLEASE save yourself the headache and chose another brand. 
After buying two automatic retractable Hozelock 50 foot hoses (that we love) I bought this for the extra hose length.  It is a very disappointing unit.  It tends to bounce around when you are pulling out the hose and can be a pain reeling it back up.   I am a big guy and still struggle with it.  Pull the nozzle back to the unit as instructed and then sit on it as you crank. ---  --- Regarding the comments about it only taking the original nozzle I cut off the end and put on a std US hose fitting
I have this radio for two weeks now.  I am very satisfied with the reception of AM, FM and Short Wave -- very sensitive.  Has great sound.  The only negative is the lack of being able to preset the stations.  Would buy the radio again - worth the money
VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: DOT NOT TURN ON SYSTEM BEFORE READING THIS.  --- You have to open up the parent receivers and plug in the battery pack before usage, then Charge the system for 16 hours. DO NOT TURN SYSTEM ON WHILE CHARGING FOR THIS FIRST TIME!!!  ---  --- I did a lot of research on monitors and found this one to have pretty good feedback on several parents' websites. With most items, there are pros and cons... see below:  ---  --- Pros:  --- -You will not pick-up any feedback from the neighbors. This is a significant improvement from monitors in the past. ABSOLUTLY NO INTERFERENCE!  --- -Great reception. You will have no problems picking up your child with this. I can take it outside and work in the yard, with confidence that I will know when my baby needs me.  --- -Interchangeable AC power cords make it easy to move the system around to different rooms in the house.  --- -Lightweight and compact system.  ---  --- Cons:  --- -The biggest issue is battery life. HORRIBLE BATTERY LIFE, TYPICALLY ONLY 3-4 HOURS at a time! The battery drain on this system is almost a deal breaker in my husband's opinion. This system comes with the options of 1 or 2 docking stations, I HIGHLY RECOMMED the one with two stations because the system is constantly running low on batteries and and can recharge while the parents portion is on the dock. Or the second receiver can be used while the other is charging on the dock.  --- -With any power interruption the child's unit shuts off. The parents unit beeps and flashes red to inform you of the issue, but it can be irritating at 2:00 A.M. to have to get up to turn it back on. Graco really needs to find a way to have the system stay on at all times that it is plugged in.  --- -Belt clip does not work well with normal amount of movement. The system is better left unattached to belt, unless you want to be constantly picking it up from the ground.  --- -A bit expensive. ---  --- A little of both... Pros/Cons:  ---  --- -Sound: Pro: Great sound, very clear. In fact I can often hear dogs barking outside with this monitor. Con: Picks up on every little sound because it is so sensitive. For the light sleepers, on the softest level still can be very loud.  --- -Loud, every 5 seconds, parents warning: Pro: Beeping will let you know that system is not functioning correctly so you can fix the system. This was nice for us one day when the baby's system had fallen and came unplugged. If the system had not beeped, we would not have known. Con: Annoying beeping while searching for signal... a startling fact in the middle of the night.  ---  --- *Overall the system does what it should, but there a few area's that could be improved. I gave it 3 1/2 stars but rounded it up.*
I actually bought this for my husband. He loves it, it  has a lot of great features. The only thing that we found was that you had to really wet the device in order to get it to read the heartrate.
although prince is an utter genious! this cd is merely a boring contract filler. i suggest you buy one of his older albums or the new album "musicology" instead
Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth came out of no where with this classic in "92". I was expecting the T-ROY tribute to be the only highlight, but this joint was bangin! The very underrated CL had the dope metaphors and complex lyrics. Chocolate Boy Wonder had the legendary "horns" going on. The whole album is a banger. Fav's are Pete's Sake, The Basement(Pete's cuz Heavy D rips  it), Mecca and the Soul Brother, Troy- They Reminisce, Straighten it Out( a kick in the balls for bootleggers), Ghetto's of the Mind and Skinz(CL's cuz Grand Puba steals the show on this one). Eternally Classic, rock on.
A style over substance celebration of the drag queen mentality - if you enjoy misogynist bitchy dialogue being delivered by pantomime women, this movie is for you ---  --- Elliot's love of drag queens overshadows the rest of this flimsy, contrived and lame narrative - clealry it's about getting as many shots as possble of drag queen costumes against the outback setting ---  --- It's alleged stance against homophobia and plea of acceptance of difference is trite and cringeworthy ---  --- If anything, this film reinforces negative stereotypes of gay men as nasty effeminate queens who are not to be taken serioulsy. ---  --- Sadly it's been embraced by the same pandering gay men who think drag queens are 'camp' and therefore funny, indicative of how off the mark they are of what defines camp (go read Susan Sontag boys) and how low 'gay culture' as plummeted. ---  --- There are plentiful nasty jokes targeting female gentilia, and a secondary racist commentary about Thai women 'entrapping' Aussie men ---  --- Trashy and not in a good way. A must have for no brainer gay men. --- 
If you love baths, but simply must have bubbles, then the bubble bars can be a lovely addition to a salt soak. You can also add one of these or half of a bubble bar along with one of the bath bombs. I keep buying the bath bombs and giving them away as gifts, which is an excuse to buy more lush products!  ---  --- I've tried numerous bubble bath products and these seem to produce an especially fun amount of bubbles. You can literally hide below the bubbles, there are so many. You also get the added benefit of more essential oils. With Lush products, you may have to get a journal just for bath bliss experiences. There are certain products you can blend together to create moods and moments.  ---  --- ~The Rebecca Revie
I liked the pool for this very hot summer that we have had; I would recommend a cover for it
This is a nice package of my two favorite Final Fantasy games: Final Fantasy VI and Final Fantasy V. ---  --- Final Fantasy V has never seen release here and I feel that the translation was both well done and sensitive to the original Japanese version.  Final Fantasy VI has been restored to its original glory in this version and it's a nice change to see uncensored graphics and the original "Final Fantasy VI" title with Tina(Terra) in Magitek armor. ---  --- I highly recommend this collection
I know a lot of guitarists aren't near as picky about picks as I am.  So why should you be?  After all, there is no pick that will make you play better and they are all generally the same. ---  --- WRONG.  I thought that too at first.  I figured it's just a piece of plastic, how hard can it be to pick one?  I started out with fender pick because they looked pretty conventional and they were moderately priced.  I blindly went through about ten of these due to them all breaking. ---  --- If you knew me well you'd know that I thrash my guitar...a lot...  Even the thickest picks would wear down on me within a week, and most of them were too slick to stay in my sweaty hand during these crash and burn guitar playing moments.  I came to realize that I needed a heavy duty pick with a good grip that would retain it's shape for at least a couple of weeks.   ---  --- At first I thought metal was the answer.  I mean, it's hard as rock and most of them come with a good grip on them.  But after playing with them I discovered the sound was not to my liking.  It sounded too buzzy with metal.  That's about the time I discovered tortex picks.  I was amazed.  They had the best grip I have ever felt and kept their shape for weeks!  I instantly bought every size I could get all the way from the thinnest read to the bulky blue one. ---  --- Months later I'm keeping a stock of these picks in my house.  For solos I prefer the green one because it's got just the right resistance for that fast picking but not too much so that it slows you down.  For strumming I use the orange.  It's just perfect... ---  --- I cannot express to you how much you need to try this pick.  Your wasting your money on anything other than Dunlop.  Get the tortex and see what I mean
I received one of these Bavaria Hams as a gift from a well-meaning, Glazed Ham loving, though non-cooking friend. So, being the nice person that I am, I invited he and some friends over for some Ham, Asparagus and a big pile of Yukon Gold Potato salad. And since it was hotter than blazes inside, I decided to heat the Ham and roast the asparagus and potatoes on the BBQ.  --- I slathered the Ham with my secret BBQ sauce, placed it on the cooler side of the Grill and about 2 hours later we were all sitting down on the patio with a big, hot, delicious, BBQ'd Ham staring us in the face. --- The French Rose' was poured, the Meal was consumed and a good time was had by all
Dr. Scholl's Pedicure Essentials Cracked Skin Repair Cream had a very nice smell and felt good. However, the long-term effects weren't what I expected. I couldn't tell much of a difference after using it for a week. Regular lotion that I've used in the past seemed to have the same effect. Perhaps it just needed more time to work
I enjoyed this book immensely.   ---  --- Remember, the subtitle is "MY friendship with JFK, Jr.", the book is about the author and HIS friendship with John.  It's not meant to be a historical view of JFK and his presidency. ---  --- Why is it OK for Carole Radiwill to write a book about her relationship with JFK, Jr. and Carolyn but not OK for Billy Noonan? Because he wasn't on Oprah. ---  --- Lighten up. 
We have the original "Super Mastermind" which is the exact same layout.  It's fun and enjoyable year after year but too many games at one sitting can cause a headache.  It's fun to watch others work at it too.  The pieces are small so should be kept away from little kids but age 10 and up seem to enjoy it.  It's a great addition to our game shelf and we are getting more to give as gifts
I have to write a review for the below review (the one I have in quotes). The below reviewer states this is 170 Watts and you need 1875 watts. I nearly fell off my seat! Not only by the review but by how many people recommended it! FIRST, 100 watts is average for a hair straighter. 170 watts is excellent! 1875 would melt your hair! I did not think it was fair that this person rated the item without having knowledge on wattage.  ---  --- "This straightener only has 170 watts of heating power. That is not a very good number! If you want salon-straight hair you need a ceramic straightener with 1875 watts... especially if you have thick or very frizzy hair!
Asimov's provides 11 issues annually, packed with science fiction novellas, novelettes, short stories, poems, book reviews, and editorial articles.  As with any anthology or anthology-magazine, the story quality varies, but there are some true gems.  Alan M. Steele wrote a series of stories for Asimov's, beginning with the wonderful "Stealing Alabama" and including the stunning "The Days Between".  These stories were later combined in the novel "Coyote".  One value of this magazine is to introduce readers to authors they do not know.  Several years ago, George R. R. Martin wrote a short story for Asimov's that I found enthralling.  It turned out to be a portion of Martin's then-upcoming novel, "A Game of Thrones", which is in itself the first in a series of books (now going on four, rumored to be seven overall) called "A Song of Ice and Fire" and that is probably my all-time favorite fantasy series.  Overall, Asimov's is a science fiction buffet; you get a little taste of everything, some of it good (Kage Baker's "Company" series), some of it great (Martin's and Steele's above-mentioned stories), and some of it that you take a bite and leave the rest for the bus-boy (I don't care for Elliot Fintushels' "Izzy" series)
Some musicians, like fine chefs, make it look so easy.  David Grisman is one of them.  On the CD, "I'm Beginning to See the Light," the prolific mandolinist extraordinaire is joined by Scottish guitar virtuoso  Martin Taylor and veteran Grisman Quintet members Jim Kerwin and George  Marsh (on bass and drums/percussion, respectively) for one hot little  album.  While the song list is comprised of many well-loved standards, such  as "Autumn Leaves," "Makin' Whoopee," "Lover  Man," and "Cheek to Cheek," the Taylor/Grisman Quartet seems  to have so much fun preparing its stew and adds enough incredible  seasonings to the pot to make Emeril shout, "Bam!"  As Don  Stierberg, who penned the liner notes, says:  "Music need not be  trendy to be great."  I wholeheartedly agree.  (C.A. Carlino
TaxCut is easy to use but the explanations are not complete, nor written in a way that is easy for laypersons to understand.  Many terms of art are not defined at all.   ---  --- Most disturbingly, when you first sign up for the product the price is listed at $54.95 for both state and federal filing,  but after you have already done all the work and are ready to file, the only options listed at checkout time are $29.95 for federal and another $29.95 charge for the state filing.   ---  --- This bait-and-switch is apparently widespread and common for H&R Block, unfortunately.  I called and complained to customer service and they refunded me $5.  I told them that I thought it was certainly unethical and probably illegal, and they were inviting a lawsuit with this deceptive practice.   ---  --- Finally, the program crashed several times while I was using it.   Although the data was always saved, it was quite obnoxious.  I run a high-performance, well-maintained Mac PowerBook, so I'm not accustomed to having things run so poorly.   ---  --- next year I'll go with TurboTax.
There's a review here that compares Hank III with Hank, and then suggests that Hank III adds to the legend with his clever lyrics.  I think that person has never listened to Hank's stuff.  It's hard to compete with, "You wore out a brand new trunk, packin' and unpackin' all of your junk."  That's my favorite Hank lyric, and there are many, many more--very, very clever, very hard to compete with.  That said, I love III.  He has a hard way to go, and apparently he's going it.  I can't even imagine the dichotomy he faces--looking and sounding like Hank, and I'm sure he loves that, yet wanting to do his own stuff.  I bought his first CD as soon as I knew about it, and I've been waiting for this one.  On the first one I was disappointed with his writing (but he's a kid, for pete's sake) and was knocked out by Wayne Hancock.  On the other hand--I didn't know III existed until I saw him on Conan O'Brian, and he was one of those performers who makes your head whip around and hit the "record" button so you can find out who he is.  I've listened to everything on Lovesick Broke & Driftin' and I love it.  Except for Atlantic City--once you've heard The Band do that, you don't need anything else.  Hank III, however, is on his way, and I'm rooting for him.  He's got the stuff.  (And, by the way, to echo the sentiments of others on this board, I don't listen to country anymore, at all!  It's way too pop-commercial-boring-who cares!)  I haven't listened to a country station for more than 10 years.  Go, III.       
Easy to learn, takes very good photos in well-lighted areas but you DO need to use the flash for dimmer environments - its low-light capabilities aren't that great. Very fast readiness time from the moment you switch on the camera - a bit slow to recharge from a flash, though, and there's a bit of a lag when you press the shutter button to when the photo is actually taken (not so great for fast action shots, even though it touts a "sports" mode). It's a good beginner's camera, a good pocket-style camera, but certainly not to be mistaken for a high-end unit.
I have not yet recieved this magazine, how could it be reviewed
I'd have to start off saying that Morrowind has been one of the most unique RPG's I've played.  It's been at least as immersive and engaging as Baldur's Gate 2 or Planescape: Torment.  The developers accomplished what they wanted to; to make a game where one can do as he/she pleases.  There are countless ways to play through this game!  Playing through as a thief type character is by far different than playing through as a more combat oriented character.  The world is huge, and it takes hours upon hours to explore.  There's so much that if you don't stop and turn around sometimes, you're bound to miss the enterance to an anscesteral tomb or a smugglers cave.  ---   --- Now about some technical things.  I'm running this game on a P4, 2.53 ghz, 768mb PC2700 memory, GeForce4 4200 Ti GPU.  The game runs great at 1024x768 resolution with full shadows and distance. Since the graphics are a little dated, and I more than excede the recommended system, I've chosen to install sevaral mods (which is another great way to keep this game fresh!).  Most notably, the "Better Bodies", "Better Heads" and "Morrowind Comes Alive."  The first 2 make the humanoid people look less blocky and more realistic.  The Morrowind Comes Alive adds many more NPC's (generic travelers, to ones that have something to offer; be it goods to sell or hostile bandits with nice looot) at random places, giving the game even more of an immersion factor. ---  --- Over all, I highly recommend this game.  In fact, I bought it to keep me from wanting to play World of Warcraft, and it's worked
This item came to me and as much as I tried, the only way I could view the numerals on the ceiling was to see them upside down. There was no way to turn the unit so that it would project so that I could read it from my bed. I tried placing it on both sides of the bed but that didn't work either. It seemed to me, the guts of the unit were placed in wrong. And there is only one way to move the projector. So, I cannot recommend this item.  I sent it back
The only reason Susan McCrook wouldn't talk was she was afraid she'd end up taking an ADN (Arkansas dirt nap). Case closed
I am sad it takes so long to send me my first issue-\ --- Sure it would be good if I was ever to get one? --- Dave Tuman --- New Bern , NC
The only good thing in this movie was Ms. Howard's performance, she is innocent and believable.   I can't understand how good actors like Weaver, Hurt, and Phoenix would let themselves be wasted on this. The 'plain' dialogue among the 'elders' is painfully numbing, choppy, and stilted.  And the directing drove me crazy, especially since M. Night...insists on filming group scenes as is he was just passing through, or following them without ever bothering with close-ups. These scenes make me feel like they were done by an amateur filmmaker with a his first video camera.   If you like the back of William Hurt's head, you'll get plenty of it in this film, the camera seems to avoid his face like the plague; which is too bad, since when he finally has a good speech, we are deprived of the anger I imagine was in his eyes.  I agree with others, I would have worked better as a 30 minute Twilight Zone episode.  Rent it first before you buy, and save some money for a classic thriller, like Psycho
I am only giving this product such a low rating because of the shipping.  The product costs $29.95, and shipping is $22.49 ... Doubling the cost! ---  --- This is the product we used to flavor the popcorn in the movie theater I worked in during high school.  I adore it
The book is complete brand new and I got it very quickly after the order even with the free shipping service. In addition, the price is pretty good for the book with such a good condition.
I ordered this headset in silver - Webtreo sent out white, but said that even though it appears white, it really IS silver! We argued about the color, and I finally convinced them that Samsung makes white, silver, red, and black. It took almost a month to get resolved, but I finally have the silver headset that I ordered. It is very small, light, and easy to use. There are 3 different size earpieces for a better fit. The headset gets 4 stars, Webtreo only gets 1 star.I wouldn't order any products from them again
I've never been a big soy eater until recently.  I have started trying to eat healthier, avoiding white flour, sugar, etc...Well, so I bought this product in order to have some baked foods around, like muffins & stuff. --- It is really good when used as a substitute for white flour, and our whole family is happy with the stuff I am baking!  :)   --- 
Ya, Abomination to God also set it right in his worthy review. I remember the days where this panzy was praised and all of you ate that "One Call Away" and "Right THURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR" garbage. Does 2 stars explain anything? This apparently is equal to that D4L s***, which is actually the lowest of the low. Anyways, didn't I tell you Chingy would die one year after -Jackpot- hit?  ---  --- Now that he's dead, everybodies focused on T-Pain, OH S***!  
I have used this procuct in the past with great success, but Ghost 10 is useless. Symantec tech support is (as far as I can tell, been doing computers since 1957) the worst. If you get the Boxed version It says PC Magzine September 2004 "Belongs in every serious PC user's toolbox."  Think about it using a 2004 quote. In 2004 and 2005 I would agree.  The 1st sys I installed Ghost 10 is a Dell XPX600, Boot disk will not work, BackUp will not work, blue screen when backing up. --- Tech support directed me to web sites that don't exist, and the sites that did come up didn't have the files NU tech listed.  Dell Workstations 530 and 360 both dual processor, no games, 15,000 Scsi Raid, 4GB mem, 1GB nVidia, Dual Displays -- They Crashed and had to be reformated and reinstalled. System works 2005 expired I couldn't use my Ghost 9 backups, and I kept getting virus pop ups that were generated by NU, the systems were shipped to Panama and were in Customs for over 6 mo this is not a usual event in the life of a computer, but with no tech support and my computers only starting long enough to tell me Sys Works was not up to date I reformated. I purchased (in anticipation of setting up my computers) boxed from Amazon and download from NU Ghost 10,Sys Wrks prem, NU int sec (2007 versions) but couldn't install them. That was Mid December 2006, now its January 19, 2007 and still not one answer from NU that works, yes all systems are pluged in to  TrippLite Smart3000RMU & TrippLite line condidtoners (2 Batery Backup Units), the computers lived in ST Maarten and the power was 105 to 140 volts with lots of downtime. --- Panama weather, people, public offices are great (Driver lic $24 Lic plates $30 for 3 years, St Maarten driver lic $450 for 2 years, Lic plates $400 yr) sailing is better in ST Maarten. Life in Panama ( and I don't speek Spanish yet )is good Norton is bad. l read a lot mostly tech books, I purchase tools, electronic gear, software, computer hardware, etc without Amazon it would be hard to live offshore,no need to go to Borders, Amazon is online 24 7.
Probably would buy other camera if I could do over this one takes along time to gechage after flash. It is very touchy and you get alot of blurred pictures. You have to learn how to be very steady with it
Don't expect to receive this by Christmas even though it says "in stock". I ordered this on Dec. 14th and just received word today, the 20th, that it is not expected to ship until the end of January, early February. So if you need it for a specific occasion, don't count on it getting there in time
sometimes you get a good bargain - cheap price for a good quality shoe.  this case is a classic - you get what you pay for.  cheap price for a CHEAP shoe.   ---  --- 1)this shoe is very heavy for a comfort shoe. --- 2) no arch support whatsoever. The rubber is almost too thick. --- 3) i have SERIOUS doubths that this is a leather shoe.  feels like CHEAP VINYL AT BEST.  3 days into wearing them and it looks like my shoe is going to rip in half any minute.  this paper-like vinyl/leather is pretty thin and cheap looking.   ---  --- this is by fat the worst pair of skechers i have owned ( this is my #14 pair
We needed something for our baby's room so that we wouldn't have to tip-toe around the house while she was napping. We ordered this item based on the great reviews, but didn't really know what to expect. It's much like the noise produced by a small fan, but without blowing air. It has two speeds, and complete control over the volume and pitch by adjustment of the louvers. Some reviews we read said it was not loud enough. I can't imagine that being a problem as we have it on the quietest setting (louvers completely closed, and low speed) and it's perfect. On high it's PLENTY loud for a device used while sleeping. This product did the trick for us, and I would recommend it to anybody with a light-sleeping baby
I bought this toy for my sons 3rd birthday. He likes it, but the bean bucket is really light and only takes one or two beans to tip it. He does not seem to mind because he is so young,but as he gets older I do not think this will be one of his favorites. I have a feeling this one will be sitting in the closet
Beautiful & deep blue round crystal post earrings.  I love them
I read about this product on the Hungry Girl website.  It listed Amazon as a supplier.  I read all the reviews and decided to place an order.  It took longer than I expected to arrive, since I had to pay extra shipping I thought it would be here sooner.  The extra shipping must have been  for the cool pack in the box it was shipped in. ---  --- The noodles were a little chewier than regular pasta.  But like regular pasta the didn't really have a taste of their own and took on the taste of what ever sauce you use.  I really did like them.  Being diabetic, it is a great pasta alternative that will not raise my blood sugar.  And I didn't find a unpleasant smell when I opened the bag as another reviewer wrote. Just the same I did rinse them well. ---  --- I have since found them in a local health food store so I won't have to pay the high shipping any more.  I have not been able to find the spaghetti type anywhere, only the flat noodle type and I would really like to try the spaghetti.   ---  --- I would recommend this product to any one that wants a lower carb, lower calorie pasta
I got a wagon like this when i was really small. Now I am 14 and Istill use it for getting grocries from the store.  It is still in good condition except it is rusty because i used to fill it with water nd make my friends  ride in it.   It is fun to ride down the hill from the store too my home.   It can go really fast and it's easy to steer.   You have to be careful if  you cross the road and go onto a curb with kids in it.  One time my mom was  pulling me and my sister to the store.  When she went over the curb it  tipped over and my sister scraped underneath her nose. It is a great toy  and even though i'm too old for it i still like it a lot
This cartridge is Lamy's proprietary cartridge; it isn't guaranteed to fit in other pens, and other brands of cartridges are not guaranteed to fit in Lamy pens. This is a lighter black ink, and many fountain pen enthusiasts enjoy  the variation-in-density effect of writing with lighter black inks. This ink is not very water resistant, and it is not safe for writing checks
I don't have the tin version but an earlier version.  The cards look different but the game is played the same.  I have been playing this with my now current 10 year old for 2 years and we both love it.  A little luck, some strategy, and a whole lot of fun.  Don't let the age levels fool  you-adults will enjoy this as well.  A classic that will never go out of style
July 27, 2005 --- Why haven't I heard about the Mia characters before? I bought this for my god daughters 6th birthday without knowing anything about the game. We opened it together and I was BLOWN AWAY with the 3D animation-the same quality as Pixar. Everyone at the party was glued to the computer screen in this adventure land game. Best of all, its educational but because it was so entertaininng, my god-daughter has not stopped playing it. Well worth your money! I'm going to buy the rest of the Mia series
I got this yesterday from my boyfriend and I love it. It's very pretty and I was extremely happy to unwrap it. =
I bought this camera for my wife and we find it unusable.  The problem is the flash recovery time which takes a good 5 seconds. During this time the camera's view finder goes black and you cannot use it.  Because the camera is so slow, we have missed many important pictures of our children; consequently, we found that for any important family events, this is not the camera we use.  I own Nikon 35mm SLR cameras and I am shocked that Nikon would sell this unusable product.  If it is your life your recording, I recommend that you buy a different camera
I loved the X-Men cartoon in the 90s and Fox, and always liked reading the graphic novels in Barnes and Noble and the like.  However, I just never had the time or money to get into it like I wanted.  This collection is a great way for us beginnings to understand the depth of the mythology and see the transformation of the series over the years.  Reading the first 60 issues was a trip -- seeing how the characters were developed, both the art and their literary personality.   ---  --- If you're interested in the X-Men, whether from the new movies or just from being a kid at heart -- for 40 bucks you can know it all. (almost)
After purchasing the item in december 2006 it didnt take even a week before the troubles started, it kept freezing after switching it on and took quite long to rebuild the data. At one point, (after two weeks) I lost all my data. Despite downloading the software from the website the problems didnt disappear and i am basically left with a promising player which doesnt even allow me to listen to music without frezing. ---  --- Since then i am struggling with Creative Technical SUpport team as there  --- is advise given to charge my battery or download the software from the website (which both is not been of much help) --- This player hasnt been much of use to me yet and I deeply regret having paid 360 USD.  ---  --- I gave it 2 stars because I was able to watch 2 movies while waiting at the airport and travelling, this was quite a pleasure
...if you're in the bathroom with time on your hands! I must admit that I did finish this book and was glad that the ordeal was over.  Puzo (like Leon Uris) definitely lost the touch near the end of his career and this book is no exception.  In just a few hundred pages, President Kennedy II is shown as a tyrant, a socialist, a reactionary, a humanitarian, a political bumbler, a visionary of USA utopia, a man who would kill a few thousand citizens to save himself from impeachment, a liar who can beat the ultimate lie detector, a dear and loving husband/father, etc....how many characters must one man be?  And what's this odd sub-plot of a former-Mormon/Hollywood oddball who on a whim (in less than 10 seconds of consideration when the opportunity presents itself) decides to kill the president of the United States.  Once again another character with fourteen different personalities!.  Puzo even got his basic facts wrong about the Mormons (he should have stuck with the Catholic Church). I would hate to be washed up on a deserted island and find this book washed up on the shore next to me! I would go crazy reading it again
I bought this because the only way my 6 week old will sleep is in bed with me. I bought this to try to reduce the risk of SIDS since his has been sleeping in my bed. Unfortunately, he kept moving and it was causing his legs to go off of the side of the sleeper. Once his legs went off the side, his upper body would roll which would cause his face to be almost right against the side of the sleeper. Of course this concerned me so each time I woke up, I had to move him again. Finally, after a couple of time of doing this, I just took him out of it. This is the second sleep positioner I have bought and both have been worthless!!!
Gloves are toasty...perform as expected, and are a sweet luxury after a long, cold day on the slopes; HOWEVER, the D-SIZED batteries (1 per glove) are considerably more bulky than what I expected.  Most reasonable people would anticipate having to use 3 or 4 AA batteries...but no, just one, bit fat chicken-roastin' D-sized battery.  Good product, but consider whether wearing the big ol' D's around your wrist all day will get on your nerves, or whether you'll barely notice, being bundled-up and bulkified anyway.  May also interfere with cinching up your jacket sleeves when it's really nippy out.
Whoever decided this was good for four year-olds must not be a parent of said age group. My four year-old received this as a birthday present. His adult aunt could barely figure it out. It's one of those toys that collapses the moment you play with it, taking all the fun out of the imaginative play that should be occuring. We have all the little parts and bigger pieces in a pile and he just walks around with the bigger piece wondering what to do with it, even though we have the corresponding Mystic Force Power Rangers themselves. I think this toy should be perhaps 1/4 of the price listed. Simply disappointing
I have loved reading Archie comics since I was in high school. I was thrilled to find the Archie dolls for sale. Thanks
These little dots work great and stick anywhere. The light is very bright, watch you don't blind yourself. I sometimes have a little difficulty pressing so the light stays on but usually after 1 try it's fine
We have always bought stride rite shoes for our son, however the cost can be overwhelming when you are buying a new pair every three months! I was excited to find these here at such an awesome price. They are identical to those in the store and my son loves wearing them.
I'm very happy with this device.  The suction cup holds very securly.  I would advise anyone who buys a satellite receiver to skip the adhesive mounting bracket that comes with it, it will come un-stuck eventually.  Just get one of these brackets and mount the radio right in the first place
Works Great, No problems after 4 months
I bought this because it was 50% off. I can't see how anybody can get much enjoyment from trying to look at photos on this viewer. I guess for background noise, it would be good but as a photo viewer, it's not. Small screen + low resolution = poor viewer
when i first saw the game for number 5 on top games. I new i wanted it. My littlwe bro like eww that game is horrible. I ask my grandma 2 buy it for me and it so fun. I lov it if u like games that r easy than play this on
I have used the Avent Isis pump for all three of my children and thought this product would be just as good and liked the fact that it works with the pump.  I was wrong.  Problems encountered include, it is very difficult to screw the caps on tight - they tend to leak, expensive - instructions recommend only using about 4 times and then discarding, measurements are hard to read, they do not hold a full 8 ozs, due to the shape narrow on the bottom and wide on the top they tend to tip over easily, and the adaptor for the pump is incovenient as I forgot to pack it more than once!  Save your money use bags or pump into the bottles directly if you are not freezing.
My spouse is on South Beach Diet and loves these.  I portion them out in ziplock bags( 15 nuts each) and they are grab and go.  Lots of protein, some fat and very little carbs.  Fresh and tasty.
I am an amateur indian chef.  This spice is one of my favorite spices to use when I am cooking.  It is such a versatile spice, adding an exquisite flavor to any and all dishes.  It works well with a lot of different foods.  If you are in any way interested in cooking Indian, get this spice....NOW!!!!!
Indispensable guide to what is happening in movies,television,books,and popular culture. Comprehensive,witty,well-written and,of course,entertaining
I got the impression that Rankin wrote this book in a short period of time without the assistance of a proofreader or editor. It was superficial, with such helpful hints as "People come in all sizes and shapes," and "People with a warm smile are perceived as being more friendly." I didn't need to read her book to figure those out. Her logic is also flawed. She states that, "Doctors touch patients, not vice versa because doctors are more privileged and powerful than patients." Did she consider that doctors need to touch their patients in order to examine them - not because of any power status? Using the book to promote her feminist beliefs, numerous typographical errors, and trite comments also distracted from what little substance the book had to offer
Newt Gingrich presents common sense solutions to the pressing issues of our day in a clear concise and easily understood manner.  This book should be required reading for all civics and history classes in high school and college.  If the policies Dr. Gingrich proposes could be implemented, the US would not only become the shining city on a hill, it would also become, far and away, the world's most powerful economy throughout the next fifty years with prosperity for all Americans who chose to join the ownership society he envisions
I have banged my watch against all kinds of hard surfaces and am pleased to say that this thing is built tough.  Everytime I've accidentally hit it against a counter top or wall, I worry that I might've scratched it, but everytime (knock on wood) it's come out clean.  Another good thing about this watch is that it's light.  For a big watch, it doesn't weigh me down like a stainless steel model.  I've gotten many compliments on it.  I love it
I bought this carry case for my son's L-Max.  It works well for carrying the unit and all the games he has for it.  I wouldn't advise dropping it on a hard surface of any sort.  It is not nearly padded enough to be carrying a hand held gaming unit of any sort.  My son likes to take his L-Max to school with him for mornings before school begins.  I place it in the carrying case and then place the carrying case inside of his backpack to give it some extra cushioning.   ---  --- If I had known how little padding there was in this particular carrying case I probably wouldn't have bought it.  There is a carrying case out for the Nintendo Wii that is similar in style but much more padded.  I almost purchased it but then thought that I should get something designed for the Leapster L-Max.  If I had it to do over I would have purchased the case for the Wii.  It might have been a little big but the extra padding would have made up for it. ---  --- Overall, it is not a bad purchase but for the money you should get something a little more protective.  After all, the Leapster starts at $69.99 and the price goes up accordingly for the L-Max
I bought this with my camera and I guess I didnt realize I could get 3 sony tapes at walmart for the same price. My bad. But I would recommend you get the sony ones locally versus spending $14 on one tape
I'm still waiting for Poldark to make it across the pond. Until then, I'll satisfy myself with this fine work
Treasure Island has that magical touch to it Walt Disney was famous for. Treasure Island teachers one at a young age not everone is who they seem. Lots of good guys and bad guys and Pirate Treasure leads to a wild ride! This film should be required for all youngsters! There is a special place in my heart for this film. This was Robert Newton's finest hour playing Long John Silver
Ordered a new pen and pencil set, opened the box only to see "Made in China". I dont even want them now
The warmer made such a loud beep when it completed its task that it woke our baby up. So much so that we ended up staying near it to shut it off before it went beeping! Had to also physically pull out the power cord after each use as it had no auto shut off. ---   --- [...
Okami is a fantastic game, perhaps the last great game released on the PS2.  Stylish, fun, and packed with a good bit of humor, this game kept me occupied for over a week.  Although it can certainly be played a good bit faster, most people will probably rack up 30+ hours playing this game through the first time.  The action-adventure style gameplay owes quite a bit to the Zelda series, but the celestial brush adds a nice (and original) gameplay element. ---  --- Okami is not overly difficult, I found it a bit on the easy side.  The camera can also be a bit troublesome in a few places as well, but I would be hard pressed to find many other faults with this game.  Unless you have a real dislike for cel-shaded graphics, I would heartily recommend this game for any PS2 owner
If you are trying to decide between a wood or foam yoga block, I can highly recommend the foam blocks with beveled edges because they are very comfortable.  ---  --- When you are pressing on the blocks, they are firm enough to withstand your body weight, but not overly firm so they make your hands hurt from the pressure.  ---  --- Blocks tend to encourage proper form because they allow you to slowly work into poses and provide the needed support when you can't reach the floor in a pose. The lightweight blocks are easy to move from side to side and they can work as an extension of your arm.  ---  --- There are many ways you can use these blocks and once I started to do the Yoga Step By step workouts/yoga practice sessions, I found I really did need to buy softer yoga blocks to try some of the more advanced positions.  ---  --- ~The Rebecca Review 
Very high quality/durability. This glove works well as it should. Only complaint (splitting hairs here) is that it gets pretty hot pretty fast, and your hand will sweat. If you are an extreme sweater, you may want to sacrifice the quality construction of this glove for one that is more well ventilated.
I cannot believe this book had such a high number of positive reviews. I have read some bad books in my life but this one is one of the absolute worst!I am amazed that all the references to CHILD murder and rape can be overlooked by the rest of the reviewers
Sadly, this well designed item doesn't work for me.   It comes detached from its clip while I'm exercising and plunges to the floor dragging my headphones off
I got the baby alive Hispanic doll for my daughter for Christmas. I opted for the Hispanic doll becuase I thought my daughter would learn a bit of the two languages as we speak French primarily in our home.I must have received a broken doll because our doll is nothing like the description. She does not speak English at all...you can press her bracelet a million times and no English. And when she does speak, her English is slurred and unintelligible. We have contacted Amazon several times and have had them decline a return. After 2 months, we are still wiating for her to eat and fall asleep. VERY DISAPPOINTING! Would not recommend at all!!! The reason that this rating received one star is because my daughter loves her death even though she does nothing
This game is, simply put, not good. I got bored to tears playing it, then ended up giving it away because it was robbing useful space on my desk. It is slow-paced, predictable, and not suspenseful at all. In fact, these characteristics are probably why it's so mainstream, even though it's laughable in comparison to real first-person shooters, which by the way don't even belong on consoles. Owning at this game means you are an average player. Any true FPS gamer knows what childish, pathetic garbage this is, while the rest just go with the hype. Many have successfully deceived themselves into thinking it's worth anything at all. It isn't
I bought these as gifts.  For the price, you can't beat it.  The tins each had a horrible sticker on them about shipping the items as a unit, I assume instructions for the warehouse packer.  When peeling them off, a lot of residue was left behind but it easily came off with rubbing alcohol
The story of Wim Wenders' "Wings of Desire" is told through images and thoughts.  Abandon all expectations of seeing anything resembling a conventional film before watching it.     ---  --- Two angels glide through the streets of Berlin surveying its inhabitants.  Cassiel (Otto Sander) embraces his role as witness but Damiel (Bruno Ganz) wants to break free of his ethereal existence.  He is willing to cast aside his immortality in order to experience the simple joys of everyday life.  The primary catalyst for his desire to change is his attraction to trapeze artist Marion (Solveig Dommartin).  ---  --- "Wings of Desire" does not quite work.  It stumbles not because it is too pretentious or too ponderous.  Rather, it stumbles because it is just too abstract.   Relying on imagery and monologues to tell a story makes for an interesting lesson in unconventional filmmaking, but it also leads to frustration and annoyance to anyone conditioned to more traditional narratives.  "Wings of Desire" deserves a lot of credit for its innovative approach toward its material and its beautiful dream-like visuals.  Yet, it is a film that unfortunately will not appeal much to the mainstream viewer. 
I'm enjoying the game, it was in perfect condition when I received it.  I haven't had the chance to play as much as I'd like, but I will
This is a great fit for a silk shirt. I thought it would not be a close fit being silk, but I was wrong. This item fits snug and looks great on. Both alone and layered.  I would recommend this shirt to people that like the look of a tight tank.
I bought this camera for its great price, good reviews, and overall reputation as a great camcorder for the novice shooter. I returned the camera after three weeks, however, due to abysmal low light performance among other things. ---  --- The catalyst for purchasing this camera was the impending birth of our first child. I took the camera to the hospital and filmed some of the labor/delivery and follow up. Unfortunately, when we returned home to view our footage, much of it was grainy and plagued with shadows and silhouettes. ---  --- The camera does include a light and a MagicPix option, but unless you're using a tripod, you're bound to end up with a strobe-light effect (Perfect for recreating "Thriller music videos," but not much help otherwise.) ---  --- I also found the image quality with the GS31 to be fairly lackluster and pixilated. Granted, you get what you pay for, but I was really taken aback that my 1992 camcorder shot much better footage. ---  --- That being said, the camera did a lot better in good/outdoor lighting (albeit still somewhat pixilated), and the zoom is incredible. The camera is very light and smaller than I anticipated. ---  --- In the end, I returned the camera in favor of a more significant investment (...) ---  --- I will say that Amazon did a great job with customer service throughout. Also, if you do buy this camera, make sure to buy the DV cable (firewire for Macs) through Amazon or some other online retailer. (...
I only got about 2 hours of run time per charge out of this battery so I returned it for my money back and picked up a batterygeek universal dvd battery which is now giving me 7+ hours of run time per charge. 
The third time I wore it, as I tried to zip the bottom-most compartment with one hand (other arm is carrying my 14-month-old), the plastic piece on the main strap simply broke, and pieces just flew off and now it is completely unusable. I do not recommend this product because of its poor construction
I purchased this software mainly for Web Design.  I am beginning in Web Design and found Microsoft Frontpage 200 easy to learn with a lot --- of interesting features to design a web site.  I would definitely recommend this product
This is exactly what I was looking for.  It's longer and perfect for wearing on your hips.  Feels nice and soft and belt is not stiff
this was a great movie i really enjoyed it . the story was unique and the acting was great .i thought it was the best ghost story i have seen 
This is the first book I have read from this author.  I am truly amazed at how well I enjoyed his style.  It kind of reminded me of some of the good Stuart Woods books I have read.  I plan on reading many more from Michael Connelly.  Great read, you won't be disappointed, trust me
I bought this tool after reading all of the glowing reviews. I thought this would be a good way to save money by sizing my watches, rather than paying $10 each time to have a professional do it. I was so disappointed in this tool. The link remover only pushes the pins out halfway. You are instructed to take a pair of tweazers to pull the pin out the rest of the way. As you can imagine this is not easy. My husband ended up scratching my watch as he struggled to pull the pins out. Knowing what I know now, I would definitely have invested in a different link remover
I used a bundled package in a new laptop to create a photo album. When trial time expired, I purchase the full package. I could not open the existing album with the new software. The new full package is hard to use and the so called 1000's of templates can not be found. USE SOMETHING ELSE!!! --- I even e-mailed Corel about this. Its been 4 days, I have NOT had a response. --- DO NOT BUY!!! I RATE THIS PRODUCE AS A -2 STARS
These batteries work well.  They don't last as long as normal batteries, but the ability to recharge them makes them more than worth the additional costs.  If you have kids with toys, these are a must
Nobody, and I mean NObody, could be more of an Illustrator novice & ignoramus than I.  Several months ago I was given a licensed copy of Illustrator 9 that a departing coworker had used.  Wanting a chance to design the departmental logo that otherwise would've gone to an agency, I raised my figurative hand and volunteered for duty.  Having taught myself everything from MS-DOS to TurboCAD, to Photoshop Elements, not to mention Word, Excel, and Powerpoint (don't get me started on that latter program, argh), I figured I could tackle at least the basics of Illustrator 9.  Loaded it on my laptop, took it home for a weekend....and just about lost my sanity -- and several fingernails -- trying to learn that confounding program.  I managed to produce a few logos, one of which was chosen.  But egads, what a big, stinky bear Illustrator 9 was to wrestle. ---  --- When I saw that CS2 had this Live Trace feature, I pleaded with my workplace Santa to get it for me, and WOW!  What an overall improvement!! ---  --- Illustrator will still not be as intuitive to pick up as an MS Office product, but this comes darn close.  With CS2, they've given us "hot tips" -- little clues about what some of the tools do, that pop up when you mouse over the tool.  The intuitive menus are nice too.  Also cool is that all the text & paragraph and fill & stroke features, which used to be huge boxes taking up valuable real estate on the screen, are now condensed up on a small horizontal toolbar, like in the Office products ... and when you mouse over them, the screen tips tell you how to expand them.  Aaaahh!  Finally some help for dunces like me. ---  --- Live Trace and Live Paint are unbelieveably cool.  The very first thing I did after loading CS2 was to grab a .jpg photo of a soccer ball off Google Images, and within 20 minutes, without consulting any book or online Help, I'd converted it into a simple graphic image painted into the 2 colors I wanted. ---  --- But as for a great guidebook, the reviewer who suggested Illustrator Visual Quickstart guide by Elaine Weinmann was dead-on.  I've bought several other "highly rated" books to try to help me through the quagmire of Adobe products, so I've seen them all.  The Visual Quickstart book doesn't have any of that insufferable "wanna-be-a-comic-novel-author" writing, and focuses just on the basics.  And it's very literal, with step-by-step instructions.  Still there's no substitute for the utterly excruciating process of learning Illustrator through experience.  But the Weinmann book's better than any I've seen yet. ---  --- The only reason I haven't given this product a 5 is because it still doesn't have the intuitiveness that it needs.  In that way it's still "snobby" -- aimed at pros, not folks like me who need to do occasional stuff but not for a living.  But this is a far, far, far cry better than Illustrator 9.  Absolutely worth the money, just for Live Trace and Live Paint alone
I have a volvo 960 sedan and wanted to use the seat saver in the middle seat and it DID NOT work.  The bottom section was too large for the space between the seat belt/buckle and did not allow the carseat base to be properly placed. My friend has one of those nylon seat protectors and it is much better
Outstanding service.  Product as advertised.  Excellent packing job. Arrived in record time.  Would buy again from this seller
Undoubtedly the worst 'Best Of' DVD ever made, even if someone gives this DVD as a gift you should punch that person in the face...after watching this DVD I felt like burning down the company that made this DVD . If you want to play a practical joke on someone then might as well give this DVD to him as a gift.  ---  --- There might be emotional reasons why there were some positive reviews of this horror, but it can't be for the actual DVD. There aren't words to describe how bad it looks and sounds. Shame on the band for putting this out. Obviously all them cares about is getting the money and run with a 'Best Of' on DVD.   ---  --- This item should be removed from the shelves for poor quality in picture. My taped videos on VHS from MTV and VH1 sound and look better than these ones, really. This essay in amatuerism may have some interest.  ---  --- For worse, is unforgivable is not including the whole video stuff from 90's to 2000. 'Love Is Blindness', 'Walk On', 'Elevation' and several alternative videos were edited out. Didn't they have another filmed version of 'Gone'?. Mexico City 1997 was just a below average performance. Shame on U2 for keep going with 'Gone' from that bad shaped Bono's rough night. I still dont understand why we must to keep watching the same footage for a particular song. Im talking about 'Until The End Of The World'. In case you dont know, THERES an actual video clip from that song. Rather, they just put the well known Sidney 1993 version here. ---  --- Rumors say they're going to release a DVD Boxset by late this year. I really don't want 'remastered' versions of shows we've been watching for even 22 years. Rather, I'm fond of watching previously unreleased footage.  ---  --- Just in case, here's a list of several unreleased PRO-SHOT filmed concerts from early 80's to Pop Mart Tour (I didn't include Elevation because there're 2 DVD's out there from the same Tour). Cheers  ---  --- 1- Belfast 23-01-1981 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  --- 2- Berlin 04-11-1981 (Great Goncert)  --- 3- New York 22-11-1981 (Good Concert)  --- 4- Hattem 14-05-1982 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  --- 5- Roskilde 02-07-1982 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  --- 6- Devore 03-05-1983 (Great Concert)  --- 7- St. Goarshausen 20-08-1983 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  --- 8- Dortmund 21-11-1984 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  --- 9- Montreal 27-03-1985 (Great Concert)  --- 10-Los Angeles 18-11-1987 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  --- 11-Dublin 31-12-1989 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  --- 12-Stockholm 11-06-1992 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  --- 13-Washington 16-08-1992 (Great Concert)  --- 14-Anaheim 14-11-1992 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  --- 15-Dublin 28-08-1993 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  --- 16-Adelaide 16-11-1993 (Great Concert)  --- 17-Rotterdam 18-07-1997 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  --- 18-Sao Baulo 31-01-1998 (Great Concert)  --- 19-Santiago 11-02-1998 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  ---  --- What the hell are U2 waiting for?  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  --- 
I bought this yesterday when I knew I was going to a "tailgate" party where I would be away from the baby and having a few drinks, and I may have to "pump and dump".  I was nervous at first, but this thing worked PERFECTLY! It worked just like it was plugged into an electrical outlet. It successfully pumped my breasts in 10 minutes and it fits into the case next to the regular plug. I also bought the Medela sanitary wipes to clean the breast sheids since there was no sink near by. This outlet plug is a must have if you want a quiet, clean and safe place to pump your milk. The cord is 8ft long so you can go back into the car. I love this thing and wish I bought it sooner!! It will also be great on long trips, too, so you don't get any clogged milk ducts. Highly reccommended!!
This product was such a waste. The little granules made a mess when used as a styling agent for blow-drying the hair. I will not repurchase it.
I love this clock. I wanted a small clock for my bedroom and didn't realize it projected when I bought it (was an impluse purchase when buying a DVD player) I can't live without it now. I am nearsighted so this is great in the dark. I have given four as gifts (that's what I'm buying today) and I find that when I go away it takes me a couple days to get used to the clock not being on my ceiling! I will ALWAYS have a projection clock from now on. I couldn't live without it.
Well...don't know where to start...... --- bought this one because it has Jeffrey Combs in it, Stuart Gorden is director.....and they did a good job on Re-animator. --- but let me tell you, horror freaks will be disapointed. Only one really bloody scene is worth watching...not because of the blood, not because of the gore.....just, because it is the only bloody scene in the movie...a nice looking woman is eaten by the "castel freak".....  --- If you have seen Re-animator, The Evil dead, From Beyond, Hellraiser and maybe The Thing, then skip this one..you will be disapointed like me.... ---   --- Even a John Woo action movie has more blood in it..... ---  --- 
does not cut hair as closely as their other model er 43
This is a fantastic grill. I highly recommend it if you are looking for a high quality basic grill. Assembly was rather easy and we were grilling the same evening.
John Sturges acquires a reputation as a solid director of superior Westerns filled with tense action scenes such as: "Escape From Fort Bravo," "Bad Day at Black Rock," "Backlash," "Gunfight At The O.K. Corral," "The Law and Jack Wade," "The Last Train From Gun Hill," "Sergeant Three," "The Hallelujah Trail," and one of the best of all Wyatt Earp movies, "Hour of the Gun."  ---  --- He succeeds in one of the most exhilarating opening sequences of all Western movies, when he had McQueen and Brynner riding a hearse up legendary Boot Hill creating a mood and peril that never allow the slightest degree of viewer confusion or ennui... For Sturges, the West is a man's world, and his cool, hard, detached style, emphasizing action, excitement and the rugged environment of the frontier, endorses the point... ---  --- "The Magnificent Seven" is derived from Kurosawa's superb "The Seven Samurai," a compelling tale of intimidated and impoverished medieval villagers hiring mercenary warriors to repel bandit ravages... The villagers in this case are Mexicans, plagued beyond all bearing by the activities of bandit Calavera, who always leaves them on tortillas and few beans... Three of them cross the border to offer meager pay and sustenance for any professionally skilled fighting men who will aid them... ---  --- Yul Brynner is the man, dressed in black, with the luminous dome and the hypnotic Mongolian eyes who portrays the distinctive Chris Adams leader of the seven hired gunmen hired to chase some 'flies from a little Mexican village.'  ---  --- Eli Wallach is memorable as Calvera, chief of the ruthless outlaws... He is greedy and merciless terrorizing without pity the poor peasants... ---  --- Steve McQueen gives a standout performance as the sardonic gunman ('We deal in lead, friend'), carrying appealing ease and sense of humor to his role as Vin, Brynner's first recruit and second-in-command... ---  --- Charles Bronson portrays Bernardo O'Reilly, who explains his curious name to Chris, with 'Mexican on one side, Irish on the other--and me in the middle!' Bronson, the strongest face in Western, and with a bit of Mexican in him--cunning face, steady eyes, revealing voice--the character of Bernardo O'Reilly suits him perfectly... This half-breed gunfighter becomes the conscience of the team... Because of his tender paternal instincts, he is adopted by three children who promise him, in case he falls, to bring him, every day, fresh flowers... ---  --- Robert Vaughn--who was to do nicely on TV in "The Man from Uncle" spy spoof-- plays Lee, the 'good gun' with black gloves and nightmares, living in style with no enemies alive... ---  --- Brad Dexter plays Harry Luck, Brynner's happy friend who returns to join the team convinced of the existence of a large amount of hidden gold... ---  --- James Coburn makes a big impression as Britt, the expert gunman who can out-draw a gun with his knife-throwing... His looks and vague figure of violence are quite a response for his few talks... ---  --- Horst Bucholz represents youth, eagerness, and the urge to be proved and sorted out from the boys... He was caught on the road by Rosenda Monteros... ---  --- Robert J. Wilke is Britt's insisting challenger who swells the ranks of the villains in many Westerns like "High Noon," "The Far Country," and "Man of the West."  ---  --- The Magnificent Seven's success spawned three sequels: "Return of the Seven" (again starring Yul Brynner), "Guns of the Magnificent Seven" and, last and least of all, "The Magnificent Seven Ride."  ---  --- With a terrific Oscar-Nominated Musical Score by Elmer Bernstein, "The Magnificent Seven" remains a richly enjoyable Western, shot on location in Morelos state, Mexico...  --- 
This item looks great in theory, but it just isn't worth it. The pegs are made in all different sizes - some fall out, some don't fit in, and some stick out too far, leaving you with a messy look to your lite art. One of the crayons for the neon was broken when received, but it didn't matter, since it just looked like a regular crayon drawing on black paper anyway. If you do buy this item, be sure to purchase that 25w light bulb that isn't even included
We had looked a lot of places for jack in the boxes and were pleased to find this unusual one. My girls love horses so it was a pretty easy decision to make. The music is great and it is easy to operate for both of them ( ages 20 months and 3 1/2 )
I recently purchased this pad set for my #22 Radio Flyer Wagon, but had to send them back.  If you check the Radio Flyer web site, you'll notice that the #22 Wagon sides only have two wide slats.  When I received this pad set, I noticed the picture on the package shows a wagon with three narrow slats.  The loops to attach this set of pads are intended to be affixed to the center slats.  Since my wagon only has two slats, and they are wider, the loops were in the wrong spot and weren't big enough to fit around the slats on my wagon.  I'm only guessing, but I think these might be for an older model of wagon
The roast is more smooth and mellow than Starbucks. I prefer it to Illy. Produces ample crema. It's a good value. After trying the first bag, I ordered several more. The Lavazza has become my daily espresso bean -- at least until the 8.8 pounds runs out! FWIW I grind with a Rancilio Rocky burr grinder, and my espresso machine is a Rancilio Miss Silvia
Use it with new Xerox Scanner and once the correct set up is utilized, it works wonders. Very satisfied
After years of using Symantec Norton Antivirus and related internet security products, the upgrade to 2007 seemed like a no brainier.  That was until the install started.  If you run into error 9999,171 you may as well give up, it is over.   ---  --- Following the Symantec directions for resolution of the dreaded 9999,171 error caused the entire windows XP install to be corrupt and necessitated reinstallation.  Believing that a reinstall was not all bad as it would clean up several old and no longer used software pieces and provide a clean base for installing Symantec I marched forward.  Once XP was installed and current with the patches it was time to install Symantec again.  No luck, I was still receiving the 9999,171 error. ---  --- Now it was time to get someone on the phone for support.  This is a good trick since Symantec does not readily publish a phone number for support.  The number by the way is 877-832-2810.  Be prepared for a long wait on hold.  During four support calls I experienced no less that 40 minutes on hold and the longest was over one hour.  Support is provided by offshore resources in India so not only are you fighting a technical problem you must also overcome the language barrier. ---  --- The four separate calls to support resulted in multiple steps to clean up old installs, prep for install, reboot, reinstall, hack through the registry, and oh yah corrupt windows XP again needing a second reinstall.  During the final call, the support rep finally gave up and indicated the Symantec could not be installed on this Windows XP machine. ---  --- I have since moved on to McAfee Internet Security Suite 2007.  The install took about ten minutes and I am now up and running again. --- 
I love the Medi-beads products, and highly recommend them.  Although not as comfortable as the pliable elasto-gel, I love the moist heat and the weight of the pads.  I used them therapeutically both for myself and for massage therapy clients.  I only wish they made a longer one to cover the entire back, but 2 of the king-sized pads will do it.  Microwave time will vary according to the power of your microwave. 
I've seen very inconsistant reviews for Silver Insanity items.  I received this necklace for Christmas last year, and it's pretty nice.  Generally I always receive a compliment when I wear it.  For the price, it's worth it. If you're looking for something nicer, you're simply going to have to pay more
This carrier didn't survive one airline trip.  The bag was ripped and the wheels torn off upon our 1st trip.  This carrier is junk.  Waste of my money
Over the years at various jobs, I have seen this flashlight several times. It is abused and subjected to the most terrible chemical and physical abuse. It may end up looking beat up and yucky, but they always work, no matter what the contractor or whomever does to it. If you need a reliable flashlight for the toolbox, work truck, pick-up glove compartment, etc., this is the only one you need.  ---  --- If you need a good flashlight at home, and tired of buying and throwing out all those junky flashlights from the grocery store, this one will be the last flashlight you will ever have to buy. I finally bought one just for my home, and I am only sorry I did not do this years ago (I am also happy to have one of these things that is not totally beat up like the one in my toolbox; I refuse to replace it).  ---  --- I like this version because it has a strong magnet, and you stick onto the refrigerator or the side of your truck. I also like that it has switch guards, so it will not be accidentally turned on because it is buried beneath 25# of stuff in your toolbox.  ---  --- One nit-picky complaint. It has a clip for a spare bulb behind the reflector. However, it comes empty and you have to supply your own, so buy a spare bulb at the same time you buy this flashlight. 
It's a 72mm lens hood, no vigneting, works great. A must for using EF28-135 outdoors
These are great socks.  In the description it mentions that they fit sock sizes 10-13.  I assume that is the same as shoe size, but it is not explained.  This, however, is an important point, since I wear a size 10 shoe.  I can wear the socks and I really like them but I wish they were a little smaller.  One size does not fit all.
This is a must have for your little sweetheart! My daughter carries this purse around with her everywhere that she goes. It's quit interesting finding what she has placed in her purse next ;)The accessories are cute, but she'd rather use stuff from Mommy's purse. ;) The purse is oh so cute too, and durable. My daughter is 21 months old, she received this on Christmas and has been a favorite since.
Quite different from his later big-band recordings. Some of the songs that you may find on Wes' 'BEST OF' collections sound too much like elevator music. Not so with this debut album. A drummer, a organist, and a guitar player; no horn section. Stripped down in the sence of band size but very deep and articulate playing. He shows of his trade mark octave playing, his chord solos (played over the organs rythm chords none the less), and flashy runs across the fret board when needed. A good CD to start with for the guitarist who wants to play jazz.
I feel that it is just way too much money for what you get. I own a lot of professional (Canon) equipment and gladly paid the price because they are the best things out there. But it makes little sense to market a marginal product and still expect to command a high price. ---  --- I have the S80. No complaint there. The leather case was just way too tight, which invites a fumble as you try to pull out the camera. The flap issue is an issue. The neck chain is a bit short, and similar and better items can be had for a lower price. If you shop around you can also find the Li battery for less. ---  --- I'm not upset, but just disappointed with what I got for the price
Looks nice when it was standing. Took several hours to erect doing it by myself. Had 20 mile per hour winds and the thing broke apart and I had to throw it all out. Wrote to the company because it was only 2 weeks after I received it, and heard nothing back. So, if you live in an area that has a low to no wind factor it is a good buy. But if not say goodbye
The only satisfaction I have gotten out of this product is this opportunity to vent.  If the price seems too cheap, it is.  Where to begin?  Instructions, pretty bad.  Hardware, missing, inconsistent, inadequate.  Design, deeply flawed.  Mounting, not on my standard mountain bike.  Manufacture, cheap, cheap, cheap. ---  --- What result culminated my frustrating evening retrofitting it just to see if it would work?  I'll spare you the suspense, it didn't.  Not a glimmer.
The recepients of this gift loved it!  It arrived in time for Christmas and was well packaged
They do just what they are supposed to.  Easy to put together, fill up, and store way.  I'm getting more
What could have been a hilarious, informative account of breaking outlandish old-fashioned laws and getting (or not getting) in trouble for them turns out to be no more than the story of a couple of clueless young British guys (I think the author is around 23) wryly making fun of America's perceived backwardness. Sometimes it just seemed like they were trying to do things and, when they couldn't, they outright gave up on some great chances. The Swedish girls in Frisco: WHY include it if it didn't come to fruition and, furthermore, involved no lawbreaking??? I'm still wondering why they included their 2-page tour of Hearst Castle when it was little more than a miniscule travel log (cool, Hearst had Greco-Roman statues in his poolroom). ---  --- They don't get arrested and they don't really accomplish anything. Too bad
I am a serious foodie that loves to cook and is always looking for new ways to shake up the meals that I prepare for my family.  The beauty of "Gourmet" is that they do not concentrate on the cuisine of one culture.  I also appreciate that they provide articles on both the best methods, and on quick methods and dishes.  I have read "Gourmet" off and on for at least 20 years.  The magazine has changed somewhat during that time.  The focus has shifted to more of a lifestyle magazine than a pure cooking magazine. ---  --- The features of the June 2006 edition are as follows: ---  --- Tiki Time:  a collection of Polynesian food and drink --- We are Family:  recipes for a summer party --- A Greece Less Traveled:  northwestern Greece travel and recipes ---  --- In the section, Seasonal Kitchen, there is a very well done article on salads.  The roasted vegetable panzanella is fantastic. ---  --- In the Gourmet Everyday section, I always enjoy the three regular articles:  Quick kitchen (30 minutes meals), Five Ingredients, and 10 minute mains.  These are always tasty and usually all quick. ---  --- If you are a foodie, and/or you want to be this magazine is a nice starting point.  I would suggest that you pick up a couple of issues on the newsstand to confirm that this magazine is for you before subscribing.  I highly recommend this magazine for budding home chefs.
This is a wonderful book, aimed at helping the struggling new mom with the all-too-often misunderstood Post-Partum Depression symptoms.  While I am thrilled that such a renowned star is willing to share her story for the benefit of others, I urge Brooke Shields to re-consider a comment she made recently. She indicated that while she KNOWS now that Post-Partum Depression is real and requires treatment of both medicinal and therapy support,...she does NOT believe that ADHD exists nor that it requires the same level of support.  It is essential that such public figures realize that what they HAVE experienced is not the ONLY form of reality.  Thousands suffer with ADHD in ways that interfere with their livlihood, schooling, relationships and self-esteem issues.  Studies have shown this challenge to be as REAL and as DEBILITATING as Post Partum Depression.  So please,Brooke...don't deny the realities of OTHER maladies, simply because you haven't experienced them. You of all people should realize how frustrating it is to have your challenges blown off by others. Your "voice" is heard loudly.  Your message must be correct.  Thank you
These cards are overall a good deal. They work best for invitations, announcements, and other times when you will be doing mass mailings. They are a little too flimsy for my liking for nicer, individual cards, despite Avery advertising them as "heavyweight" on the box. That's the only reason I give them four stars instead of five. Other than that these are great cards; I haven't had problems with smearing or paperjams at all. The cards are scored evenly and fold very easily. The texture is a nice touch, too
very efficiently drains about as much milk as I can get with the Pump in Style Advanced for me, and very portable and easy to clean. I use it when I have a little more time or when I don't expect to pump more than a couple ounces (between feedings). Despite Medela's warnings, I would say you could use this to pump daily, aslong as you  are careful to fully drain the breast (massage), but maybe not okay for maintaining supply for multiple pumping in a row
This magazine is great! For sport-specific magazines, this is probably one of the best that I have seen. Yes, the photos are large and detailed. But, the kicker is the writing. Incredible content without being wordy. Variety of topics and approaches brings out varying highlights of the sport. Just very impressive
Rockstar games  are rocking the gamers world,one more of the great titles from the leaders in adult games
I just want to let potential marketplace buyers of SALO that the seller: closeoutgoods and other Amazon marketplace sellers are selling pirated (bootlegged) editions of this movie and other Criterion DVDs. If Amazon were legitimate, they would ban these marketplace sellers from their website. Every potential buyer should report these crooks to the FBI and Criterion
I beat the hell out of everything I own. My PDA which this has partially replaced has an aluminum hardshell case and a metal body. I have broken just every watch I have ever owned (and I have/had a few excellent watches). I am naturally hard on things due to my focus on life not on my gear. This little notebook has kept itself together so far, while looking very hip.  ---  --- I am a software engineer/project manager and am cognisant of my technological options, this is just faster, lighter and thinner than my PDA for scribbling notes. I am never without it in the office.  ---  --- The back folio pocket and the elastic strap looked dumb when I first bought it. However, I use the folio pocket for receipts to be reimmbursed (better than leaving them in a pocket to be washed or thrown out)and the elastic strap serves double duty as a second bookmark and to keep the notebook together (keeping it closed helps it survive). ---  --- I like the construction and archival quality of the book. My notes look more like those of a disorganized madman than a manager (I am starting to wonder if they are synonomous) but if I ever have to refer back to them I can be assured that they will be there for a long time.  ---  --- It only received 4 stars because they are [...] a piece and at my current scrawling rate, I will probably need about 4 or 5 a year. Just get your company to pay for it if you can, because they are notebooks that you can rely on to be there for a long while. ---  --- Lastly: For the person who likes their Montblanc notebook with tear out pages, they are partially missing the point. These books are for archiving and keeping records (of questionable usefulness in my case) not for making quick throw away notes. I also highly doubt that their notebook is as thin as one of these is either. Each have their own place
This is great to have if you are going to be on the road and need to pump.  The long cord was helpful too, so you can sit in the backseat and be discrete. It was a bit tough to insert into the outlet in my car, but I 'm hoping that it gets easier the more I use it. 
Works like advertised. Syncs well with atomic time from Colorado (I am in California). Looks nice. --- 
I find this store to be very accomodating.  Will definitely shop there again
some of the pros of buying the sniper rifle is... --- it shoots crazy fast and is very accurate --- I shot my uncle with it and it made him BLEED --- none of the kids in my neighborhood want to fite against me any more --- some of the cons of buying the sniper rifle is... --- the safety can't be pushed to hard or it comes out --- the handle starts getting kind of wobly and mine came off --- the battery takes longer than it says to charge to work ---  --- please take my advice because I have had this gun for more than a year now and I know it front and back
We 1st found this coffee at a local store. The local store decided not to carry it anymore and we were without it until we found that Amazon sold it. --- It has a good aroma and taste plus it is organic as well.
I've been taking these for over 3 weeks.. I have not seen any new hair growth.  I think that new hair that does grow will be stronger but this has not caused my hair to grow any faster.  I would suggest just buying hair supplement vitamins from GNC or any other place you can find them.  They are much less expensive
When mini-wheats first came out in the grocery store, I tried them. However, I found they were bland. It was like trying to eat sticks in milk.  ---  --- Then came "frosted" mini-wheats. Okay, I decided to give it a go. Now I had sticks and sugar in milk. However, I did find out that if you forego the milk and just eat them straight from the box, like potato chips, they are excellent! ---  --- Now Kellogg's has added fruity flavors to the mini-wheat. THESE I CAN EAT IN MILK! Yippee! Finally!  ---  --- I picked up the "Strawberry Delight" in bite size. Even though I can eat them in milk, I find that I still prefer just to eat them straight from the box, like potato chips, a type of chex-mix, or square wheat thin snack.  ---  --- Each serving has 140 calories. Compare that to other cereals and you'll see it is about 60 - 100 calories less. No saturated fat. No trans fat. No cholesterol. No sodium. Total fat is only 0.5g according to the box. I don't see how, since zero and zero is, well, zero. But I can live with 0.5g.  ---  --- Here is the bad news, the carbohydrates. There are 35g of carbs here. But that is about the same as all the other brands. Diabetics may want to pass on this due to the 10g of sugar per serving. And remember, a single serving is about the size of HALF a base ball. Not much. So if you are just pouring cereal into a "cereal bowl" without measuring, you are probably getting 2 or 3 servings in that one bowl. ---  --- All-in-all, unless you are diabetic, this mini-wheat is terrific!  ---  --- Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews
So far I am very happy with this purchase. It seems to be relatively accurate with temperature, humidity and pressure readings, and the atomic clock sets itself every night. ---  --- I love having the sunrise/sunset times as well as the moon phase displays, And it's very easy to get that data for any city for any date without having to permenantly change the date or city on the unit. Very cool. I don't like the fact that the moon phase display is "backwards" - a full moon, in my opinion, should be a full white circle and a new moon should be a black circle. This unit shows the moon as black instead of white. But once you get used to this, it's no big deal. I really like the fact that all of the buttons are on the front of the unit. Some other La Crosse products have buttons on the back or other hard to reach places. ---  --- I have found a few problems with the design. There is a curved glass (or plastic) cover over the entire display that is very reflective. The reflections make it impossible to read across the room. In fact it's difficult to read standing right in front of it because of the reflections. It's best to stand just slightly to the right or left. ---  --- I was excited about the fact that the display shows the high and low temperature and humidity at all times for each of 3 sensors. However, I was dissapointed that you can't recall the date and time that the high and low was recorded, as you can with other La Crosse products. Also, when you reset the high/low, you have to reset all sensors at once instead of being able to reset each individually. ---  --- It can be challenging to set up 3 remote sensors, especially when you have more than 1 base unit, but it can be done (I also have a La Crosse alarm clock that projects the time and outdoor temp on the ceiling, so I wanted to get both units to read the same sensor as #1). ---  --- Although this may sound like a negative review, it's really not. The features and functionality of this unit far outweigh it's shortcomings. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants the features it provides. Make sure the dimensions fit your needs. It might be a bit large to sit on a desk - best to hang it on a wall. It also comes in oak instead of brushed aluminum sides.
When I bought this camera the sales people tried to get me to buy another battery.  They said the one that came with it would only be good for about 20 minutes.  Now I have bought alot of items in my lifetime, a 20 min battery on a camera just doesnt seem like a very good "business" choice.  So I said no.  So I got the camera, charged the battery until the light went green (which sucked because I wanted to play with it right when i got it) and started taking pictures (oh I also got a 2G CF) worked great....so I planned to go up a mountain and take soem scenery shots.  Keeping in mind what the sales person had told me I pocketed the charger just incase.  Well, 6000', 300 pictures, and 5 hours later the camera is still running strong, still have 200 shots left for the trip home, battery life indicator hasnt budged off of the full button.  So all in all, I think the battery life is great, now i can see if your taking say thousands of pictures all in a row you may need another but for just going on a trip and shooting a few pictures at every stop point, the original will work fine.  as for the quality of photos.....i love them
I used this product and can't say enough good things about it. My friend bought it for me for my birthday and it was fun and easy to use and I lost 30 pounds in 6 months and I was never hungry. I ate at restaurants and always managed to find a perfect menu in my DietMate. I love it.  thank yo
The best edition so far,however... --- The color is smeared and skewed just enough to bother me. But what do you want for 10 bucks? I saw Gorgo a bunch of times in first run, and I remember seeing the actual Gorgo creature on it's trailer being driven up Woodward ave in Detroit on it's way to the Fox theater. A great promo. The eyes are the thing I remember most as Gorgo rises from the sea, those red glowing eyes were just beautiful and so expressive. The color smearing just manages to obscure those eyes. But still this print is the best I've seen. If I live long enough, I hope they issue a perfect HD version of this movie. I would pay 3 times the price of this edition to get my clutches on that. But this is worth the cost. A must for any serious collector
I live in an apartment building and play ( well, practice is a better word ) the bass guitar and needed headphones so I wouldn't bother neighbors or my wife whom sleeps and watchs TV about 6 feet from where I sit and play. ---  --- The 10 foot long cord was perfect for distance for sitting or standing and moving around while playing, so I wouldn't have to use an extention cable ( and usualy end up with feedback/distortion associated to an unshielded connector in an extention cable) ---  --- The volume control on each earpiece lets me adjust the volume so I don't have to mess with my amp or guitar volume settings I like to use when not using headphones.  Makes it real nice too when using an instructional CD or DVD i can turn the bass sound off in one ear to hear the instructions clearly witout needing to seriously skew the headphones off my head. ---  --- Very light weight.  Some headphones can weight the head down making you feel like one of them 'bobble heads'.  Fits firmly on the head without any pinching or binding anywere.   ---  --- Cord enters headphones on the left ear side, so you don't have to deal with the classic 'Y' split cord.  Easy to flip to the side or drape over the back out of the way. ---  --- Earpices fit nicly over my ears (no pinching, gouging or squishing with plenty of clearance around the ear) and does a very nice job blocking out noise ( when my wife is awake she watchs the TV, rather loudly, which is right next to me and I bairly notice it). Plenty of padding around the ear pieces.   Many headphones inside near the ear has hard plastic between the ear and speaker which usualy digs into the ear, but these headphones I honestly don't feel anything against my ears.  Even after several hours of use each night. ---  --- Sound quality.  Bose or pioneer they are not, but then if you wanted such high quality you wouldn't be shopping in the $20 and under headphones :) --- That being said they are very good for sound.  Sounded very good on a portable CD player. ---  --- Only drawbacks I can see is that a person with large/tall ears won't get thier ears covered by the earpads.  The inside opening of the earpads is aprox 2 1/4 inchs tall by 1 3/4.  IMO they could have been made bigger. --- Also, if you have a tall head ( good distance from top of head to ear ) you may find fully extended the headphones might not reach your ears. ---  --- I have a head like Drew Carry ( give you an idea head size/shape I'm talking about) and if the extension to each earpiece would have been any shorter they wouldn't have fit. ---  --- I wear glasses as well by the way and the headphones don't interfere, bind, pinch or anything like that with my glasses. ---  --- So, I highly recomend them if low cost headphones is what you are after( I don't recomend things often :) ) ---   ---  ---     ---  --- 
I've had this phone for a week. I'm using it with T-Mobile, so your mileage may vary. In my opinion, it's a feature-packed phone at a reasonable price (for an unlocked smart phone, at least).  ---  --- The Symbian 9 OS runs pretty well, although I did experience some lags and software freezes (with third-party apps). Fixing it was a matter of rebooting. I think the menu organization could be smarter, but you can customize much of it.  ---  --- I do love that the default screen displays your day's calendar agenda. But that screen hides the main menu. Not a huge drawback, but it confused me at first. ---  --- Photos with the 3-megapixel camera are grainy (it also has a VGA camera). Since this is a phone first, and not a camera, there is also no stabilization control. It does, however, come with a flash.   ---  --- Sound quality of phone calls is okay. Your friends, family and colleagues will hear you clearly. On your end, however, it will sound like you're talking on a cell phone. It's not bad, but I've had conversations on better sounding phones.   ---  --- I disagree slightly with another commenter about wireless internet (WLAN) access. It's possible to set a default access point. The problem is that if you aren't at that location regularly, you will have to search for a new network. One way around it is to pony up the cash for a data plan through your wireless provider. I agree, however that some kind of one-button auto-detect would be ideal.  ---  --- I don't like the SIM card slot. The metal cover pops off fairly easily -- as I found out while trying to insert my SIM card without reading the manual first.  ---  --- The phone's slider form factor moves smoothly, perhaps too much so. By default, sliding the phone completely open -- something that's hard, but not impossible to do accidentally -- unlocks the keypad.   ---  --- The N-80 is also bit awkward. It feels thick for lack of a better word. Its 5-way controller button also looks and feels a bit cheaper than you'd probably expect.  ---  --- Another drawback: no QWERTY keyboard. You can connect to a wireless one via Bluetooth. But that assumes you want to carry a keyboard. The upshot is that the predictive text feature is solid and sensible. When enabled, it works contextually: on automatically for SMS and email messages and off when typing URLs. ---  --- Overall, I give this phone high marks for features, but a few annoyances mean it's far from The Perfect Phone
An elf appearing to Harry Potter warned him not to return for a second year to the school of sorcery. The Chamber of Secrets, he said, had been opened and a  monster is lurking. Harry goes anyway and is the only one who can hear the monster, challenge it and save students who have been "petrified" by the monster. Age group interest: early teen. I wanted to see what all the rave was about. Lots of action, not much morale. ---  --- Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope, South State Street Journal
I might have been expecting too much, but I was disappointed with this book. I did not learn anything on Dark Magick per se. The first half of the book is about a variety of subjects like, Goths, Vampires, Lost Souls, the Collective Unconscious, Dark Deities, Satanism and some other stuff. The second half is about Magick, but it sounds more like High Magick to me. Where's the Dark Magick
On the surface, it's just another plain notebook. Not much to look at, really. But there is something magical about the Moleskine. I can honestly say that this pocketsize notebook has increased my creativity, simply by being there to hold whatever I choose to put on its blank pages. ---  --- It has a perfect size for those of us, who don't necessarily leave the house with any kind of bag. It fits in your pocket. Then there's the sturdy design: It's made for being lugged around. And though it may be plain, it still comes with a handy built in bookmark and a practical pocket inside the cover, where you can store businesscards, ticket stubs or whatever else you feel like putting in there. ---  --- I'm hooked on Moleskines. After having had various notebooks all my life, this is the only one I will use now
If you want a quality product, this ain't it.  The dreaded "Remove the Cassette" error is true and in full force.  Don't take my word for it, search the net and find the hundreds, upon thousands of unhappy consumers who purchased this piece of junk and discovered it the hard way.  I highly suggest the Panasonic AG-DVX100.  It costs a bit more, but well worth it. ---  --- Before reading other reviews, make sure that they are comparing the GL-2 to another cam, like Tony L. Shores.  He compares the Canon GL-Piece-of-junk-2 to the Sony HDR-FX1.  Sure, the Sony is much better, but it is also a High-Definition cam.  If you want HD, check out the Panasonic AG-HVX200. ---  --- Do your research, read the reviews
This book provides some brief but good background to set the context then proceeds to succinctly communicate those aspects of UML one really needs to know
Wow, I have never seen anything like this.  It's worse than bad; it is virtually unplayable from a technical perspective.  At the very least, Amazon should refuse to carry it
I loved the idea of the Clapper. I live alone so the clapping sound wouldn't bother me and I looked forward to the convenience factor. My first Clapper lasted about 4 months and then mysteriously stopped working, but the dead unit did smell suspiciously funny - like an electrical short. --- Did I learn my lesson? Oh, no! I went ahead and purchased another Clapper some months later. The night before last, the lamp I connected this one to started blinking. I checked the lightbulb and it was OK. It was only went I got down close to the Clapper plugged into the outlet that I heard the dreaded sizzling sound and saw a flash of electricity. Once again the Clapper crapped out, this time in a different lamp, different outlet. Will I never learn? --- Thank goodness nothing happened due to the highjinks of this faulty device. Can you say "housefire"? Again, how dumb am I? Is the unit UL-approved and, if so, have any other complaints been lodged about it? How does one find this out? --- I like my gadgets, but "buyer beware" on this one
...these are comfortable. You can actually forget you're wearing them. And if you are like me and worn just about every thong there is, that is huge. I was thinking I should just stop wearing thongs at all until I found these. I've washed my pair a couple times in the regular cycle and dried them, and it still is holding up well. I'm back on Amazon.com to buy more. Go for it girls, you won't regret it! Sexy and comfy. Could you ask for more... ---  --- I now own three pairs
The display fogged up within a week. I got a replacement, and it's doing the same thing.  Would NOT recommend this product.
I think that the new style of the people are not as nice and durable as the old ones
I know that this product works for some, but for me it did not. That is why I decided to return it. Wahl makes great products, but this product was not for me. My skin was too sensitive and the machine irritated it.
Excellent product don't hesitate this big umbrella is the perfect one to protect you and your equipment when rains start
VE2 has a ton of potential, but it just doesn't work out.  Brandy Davis is both cute and sexy, of course, but Playboy's Testing the Limits is a much better showcase for her, um, talents.  Not to be mean, but most of the film's other women just aren't that attractive, and many of the sex scenes are actually irritating because of the obnoxious soundtrack.  Contrary to a previous reviewer, the massage scene is fairly ordinary.  The girl-girl stripper scene is the most disappointing, however.  It starts really well, with the straight girl gradually overcoming her shyness and enjoying the stripper, but even the unrated version then fades to black without any real action.  The only scene worth watching at all is blue-collar vignette, with two girls and one guy hooking up. Stay away from this one
tuscan milk kosher! --- vitamin D and grade A! --- good source calcium! ---  ---  --- thank you
I bought the Zire 72s as an upgrade to my previous black and white Palm that I had no problems with. It has been nothing but a lemon since I got it. Often when I turn it on it has lines going across the screen and has to be turned off and then on again to get rid of them. The graffiti is terrible and rarely works. I have to reset it all the time. Customer support is terrible and did nothing to rectify the problems. I even sent it to them at one point and they sent it back in exactly the same condition I sent it to them. I don't think they even looked at it. After my experience with this Palm, I will never buy Palm again
I ordered two of these. For the first one, neither the firewire nor the USB worked on my iMac G5 (MacOS 10.3.9). A copy would start, and then hang after a while. I returned it and the second one worked using USB, but the firewire would hang like the first one. ---  --- A friend has one that works fine with his iBook G4 under 10.3.
Blatant sentimentality without any touch of irony or wit = Elefant's lyrics.  I personally like Interpol and the Strokes; I resent that they are being compared to these cheeseballs
We bought this for our daughter's first birthday. She was immediately interested and so was her three-year-old brother. In addition, her five cousins (ages 5-16) and their father (36)were also captivated. There are eleven gears in five colors that spin when the button is pushed. Initially, she loved to take the gears off and teeth on them. She is fourteen months now and puts them back on. She presses the button to watch them spin. She has taken it to the sitter's and the kids there have played with it all day. When we take it to the sitter's, I put it in a bag because the gears do not stay on when the toy is vertical. So far,it appears to be a toy that will grow with her as she and her brother play with it differently. We rotate toys, but I leave this one out continuously and I often find her playing with it quietly by herself. I have given it five stars because it offers a variety of ways to play (the gears can even be stacked), is different from all other toys they have, appeals to a wide range of ages, grows with the child, does not use up batteries (we are still on the first set), and seems very durable. I recommend this toy
Seems like a good idea for a seat.  I liked the handles for them to hold on to (more sanitary) and it sits okay on a big adult seat.  But the opening is just too small.  It is not the lack of a deflector.  I have another brand with a bigger opening for our other bathroom and my son does fine on that one.  This one the pee gets all over his legs, the seat, the stool and the floor each and every time.  This is a big hassle, unsanitary and a pain to clean up each time he tries to go potty.  Maybe it would be okay for a petite girl but not for a boy.  We are shopping for a replacement now.  I don't want a deflector type because the doctors warn that they can scrape a little boys private area and cause them to not want to sit on the potty because it might hurt.  We just teach him to point "it" down and on a potty with a bigger opening that works just fine
Planner is nice, but I was charged $6.25 for shipping!  Rip Off!!
I purchased the Twist & Shout Multiplication for my grandaughter who is 8 years old.  She has not put it down since she received it.  However mine was malfunctioned and would not give multiple choices.  It would only ask the question and then gave the answer. She was hesitant to give it up when I explained I needed to exchange it for another.  This is the only toy she has that has held her interest for long periods of time.  She nows brags to friends that she knows her multiplication tables
This firepit is the perfect size for a small patio. Its sturdy construction will hold up to many summers gathered around the fire. The glow is enhanced by the moon and stars cut-outs, making for a special evening event
well, first of all I ordered this product on Amazon and they sent me something completely different, they sent me roller skates with the wheels side by side instead of the roller blades I ask for like in the picture. Then when I sent an e-mail trying to exchange the product, no one returns my calls or e-mails me back, after so long of trying it's already past the 30 day exchange policy. So yeah, if you want a better review, contact me so I can exchange the product
A good product but like a lot of Microsoft releases, not everyone outside of Microsoft is ready for it.  Check with your web hosting service first to be sure they support sites developed with Expression Web.  That is a problem I have run into.  In fact some hosting services that support Front Page, haven't even come to full support of Front Page 2003 let alone Expression Web. You could end up changing hosting services to take full advantage of this product and its features
This is a nice book but it does not contain Provencal style interiors!  I am not sure how the author came up with that title since anyone who is interested in French country will not find it here.  If you are truly looking for Provencal decorating ideas-this is not the book for you.  CONFUSED!!
PLEASE, PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!  I have had this phone for 6 months, and I am SO disappointed!  Of course it worked for the first 30 days (within the grace period), but then I began having problems with keeping the battery charged.  I took it to the local Sprint store, and they gave me a new battery.  That worked for a few weeks, but just recently I've started having the same problem.  I just spent over 2 hours on the phone (of course not MY phone--I had to use my work time) with Sprint and Sanyo.  Of course, neither company was willing to stand behind the product, so now I have to send the phone (at my expense, of course) to Sanyo to have it repaired, which will take two weeks, at least.  So please, do yourselves a favor, and pick out a different phone
I recently bought this thinking I could use it to upgrade my TI-86 calculator. To my surprise I heard it was incompatible with XP. I supposed the worst that could happen is that it wouldn't work. As soon as I recieved the Cable it said to go to the website...  so I went and updated the software specific to my calculator. After the installation it asked me to restart. After the restart I immediatly recieved a Blue Screen of death and luckily windows XP found out it corrupted a file in the registry and fixed it but were it not for that I would have to do a format. I have not fully installed it yet as now I have started backing up everything as a just in case scenerio however i warn users that when buying this product be cautious as this is not 100% XP compatible and may mess up your system
Star Wars Battlefront allows you to play as some of the best troops ever, such as the Rebel Alliance, Imperials, Republic, and CIS (Confederacy of Independent Systems). The 3-D graphics make it easier to enjoy; as well for sound and storyline. In Battlefront, you can not play as featured characters in the saga, but you get to fight alongside them in epic duels. Another disadvantage is you can't wield a lightsaber either. In  Instant Action, you get to pick any location, and any side to fight for. You also have the choice to choose clone wars and galactic civil war. ---  --- As a matter of fact, you can drive vehicles, but no space combat! If you want to play on Episode III battlefields, your hopes are up. Only locations from episodes I, II, IV, V, and VI. There are numbers of areas to battle on. But for pros and cons, cons are going to have a hard time through the game such as: What type of soldier? Where is my command post? Where is my enemy at? For pros there is nothing wrong. ---  --- Star Wars battlefront is one of the best star wars games there is about Star Wars, along with the perfect gameplay, terrific graphics, and great sound. I highly recommend the game to any star wars buff's out there
I have used the Zonlabs Firewall for several years. It works fine. I can not say the same for the Security Suite. The AntiSpam function does not update definitions and ZoneLabs Tech Support know they have a problem. They are working on it but no date for a fix. --- Do not buy this software until all the bugs are fixed.
Book contains many useful lists / charts / comparisons to define giftedness.  Many helpful hints about raising a gifted child.  Main criticism is that the book is more about raising children in general -- and  may push those with "normal" kids into thinking they have gifted  ones and down that track -- when they should not. Gifted kids are the  exception, not the norm as this book makes it seem
 I love the this set ,expecially the nail cutter, I,m still using mine after six years
I don't care if it stops working tomorrow... my daughter has gotten so much enjoyment out of this in just one day that it was totally worth the money.   (you can get them cheaper at Target though)  She was always stealing the portable phones around the house or walking off with my cell phone... and now she has "her" phone she is just delighted.... she loves when it rings and she opens it up and pretends to talk.... so far this phone works great, but like I said... it is such a cool toy I'd go out and buy a new one right away.
Machine is well constructed but should have been made adjustable - also, no instructiuons were included and after having contacted the company to request instructions, I have never heard from the
Bought this 3-pack about 2 months ago (three computers at home) and worked ok- no viruses. Then I did what I thought was a clean install of XP Pro from XP Home on one of the computers, and it carried over a lot of garbage from XP Home I wanted to get rid of, but that's another issue (clean install?}. After installing XP Pro, I was warned I didn't have virus protection and so I tried installing my NAV again. You would think at some point NAV would have enough brains to try and establish that this was a Windows upgrade, and that the NAV was legitimate. Nope- fatal error and computer lock-up, which I was able to survive. No contact opportunity at the Symantec web site. ---  --- I simply opted for Microsoft's recommended anti-virus software- Computer Associates. Another twenty. Then I had a heck of a time uninstalling NAV, which wouldn't install and now wouldn't uninstall. What a waste of time and money. Who creates these viruses? We certainly know who benefits from them. ---  --- There is really nothing you can do- they are immune unless they hurt someone with media clout. This little note means diddily, but thanks to Amazon anyhow for the opportunity to say something.  --- 
 There's always the argument that if Bach had had a modern piano, he would have composed for it. Let's consider another possibility: if some style-insensitive time machine had delivered a piano to Bach's doorstep, he might have tried it out and rejected it as a bad idea, since it so obviously fails to serve the paramount musical ideals that inspired the High Baroque composers. --- For listeners who understand what Bach meant by equal temperament, it's worth noting that the standard temperament of the modern piano bears no close connection to what Bach was trying to demonstrate in these "pedagogical" compositions. In other words, the point is lost.
I'm an artist, and I use many kinds of inking pens to stylize my comic work. At a family member's house, I found a few of these and decided to test them out.  ---  --- As my title said, simply writing didn't do justice for this pen. The rolling ball guarantees no stickiness, the ink being luciously gel-like and practically being one with the paper, it is so smooth and slick.  ---  --- Even better is that I have never had this kind of pen leak or run, emphasizing what a high-quality tool it is. And a personal thing I find attractive is that the ink is pitch black, no faint hues whatsoever. That's just me, of course. ---  --- For artists out there, this is a good idea for drawing (reasons above and) because it has a wonderfully rounded tip, so you never need to worry about the point bending or breaking. And you still get a fine line!  ---  --- Whether you are a writer, artist, or both, this is the pen I would suggest for anyone. It's a dream in a writing utensil, simply put
This film i have to say is beautiful looking, from the characters to the landscape. Although lacking in numerous and long fight scenes, it does keep things interesting with matrix like effects. The only problem is the love between the two main characters . The movie never lets you feel the love between them , and the girl seems always distant about the love anyway  i mean it is called heart under blade right?  The main ninja character has the coolest power and he always seems troubled to use them it. This film is more of a drama sprinkled with ninja action and beautiful visuals! 
I received this very quickly. I couldn't believe I could get the actual namebrand at such a great price. Very pleased
I really did some research on digital cameras, even tried out a Sony, but the Canon brand is by far one of the best.  I don't have to do a lot of thinking when snapping a picture with this camera, it does most of the work!  I like to be able to think about the compostion of my photo and not ISO, aperature, and all that jazz.  The settings make it so easy and the color of the photos turn out so true.  The digital zoom is great and will even alert you if the picture will come out blurry.  There are so many features on this camera, too many to list.  I even found a great deal at Best Buy on a 2 gig memory card, I get  over 1,000 photos with a high resolution!  It takes alkaline batteries, but I bought rechargeable ones and one charge lasts a long time.  I am sooo happy with this camera, I take it with me everywhere, even a couple of days to work. 
Bought mine at WalMart (USA).  Came in a box that looked like it had not been opened. However when I arrived at the destination where the starter was necessary, (Mexico), the box was short the pieces necessary to charge the starter as well as the extra inflation devices.  WalMart was great and mailed me the missing parts.  48 hours later, after the initial charge, I was back in business.  Both clamps are metal and well built. --- Yea, WalMart and Yea, B&D
There is absolutley nothing wrong with the car charger.  It works fine.  However the fm transmitter has 2 problems for me.  1 -- The connector is not long enough to connect through many of the protective cases made for Zune so you have to take it out of the case.  2 -- The signal is VERY WEAK and did not work for me in either of my cars.  I ended up buyin a cassette adapter which worked much better and there was a 100% better sound quality
Well, I ordered this online as we couldn't find any window-mounted feeders locally. It's lasted exactly two weeks. The problem is the extremely weak design: the 14oz glass feeder is fairly heavy-too heavy to stay attached to any glass with two measly suction cups, as this has. There are somewhat strange instructions with this model, directing the user to "rub" the suction cups for several minutes in order to (supposedly) build up a proper "suction"-then the glass slides into a groove; well, the thing worked at first-until I had to slide out the glass bottle portion to refill it. I did it as gingerly as I could, not disturbing my preciously attached suction cups, refilled it(only halfway!)-and replaced it. About 4 minutes went by-and then the entire thing-glass, suction cups, everything-fell to our deck, breaking into a million thick glass shards...frustrating me, the hummers-and our two dogs, banished from the outside until I could clean up this mess. What a crummy product! And overpriced-although I wouldn't buy it again for two cents. Beware
Musician's Friend is a great outfit anyway, they've never steered me wrong. This product came fast as lightning, and as I read in the other review, the sticks were inconsistant, but I can't complain. We received a pack of 16 sticks, more than advertised. They are obviously not professional quality, but great for practice. My son goes through drumsticks like mad, and these are lasting just as long as much more expensive sticks, bought at our local Music store.
I love this chimp and I am an adult.  All the kids in the neighborhood come to play with it.  It is so realistic
This book has a lot of information about how protecting wild areas works in WA and and an overview of the protections offered by the United States Government. It then provides the inspiration to get people started through true stories of grassroots projects. While the book doesn't list 1, 2, 3, what needs to be done to start a grassroots movement, that shouldn't be expected, because all people have different motivations, and this book should be used as a tool to help you understand the basics of how these sorts of movements work. A must for anyone who wants to further understand Washington state for all of its great wild places, or anyone for that matter, that is looking for inspiration on why wild areas should be protected. Plus all of the proceeds go to a great cause
Our growing row of Everyday Food issues has the potential to become an extremely resourceful cooking library, but where is the card catelogue? If I want to find a particular recipe or a new recipe that I can make with a particular ingredient, I'd have to flip through hundreds of pages. ---  --- Luckily, I located a downloadable Everyday Food Index at OmniNerd.com. When used together, the magazine and Index truly make something that can be used effectively everyday
Umm. This is ink. Not much to say other than it works fine with my Epson R320 Printer
I bought this cable half minded reading the other reviews and i was bit worried whether it will work. When i hooked up the cable between my laptop and TV, wow.... this is really worth a buy.
I like this sheet so much better than the thin ones.  It offers more padding and seems so much more comfy!  It is a tight fit, but I had no problem fitting the sheet onto my Eddie Bauer pack n play.  So, I would assume it should fit any pack n play.  Just make sure to wash in cold water, and hang dry.  I never put this in the dryer.  The only thing I don't like is the color.  It happens to match my navy blue playard, but I wish it came in some lighter colors
I did not get the Instructional DVD, so I was left with a clipper set I didn't know how to use..
Wow, I love this mic stand!!! It really works well, especially since I play guitar and you can adjust the boom. It's great for kids, and grown-ups, too. I recommend it to any kid that is just starting to sing, or if you want to record onto cd's, you can play guitar and sing. Rock out!!!!!!!
Okay, here is the deal.  This thing is built well, but it's dimensions and performance work against it.  It's height and width are just right for a pocket book, but it's thickness gets it in trouble.  It's a clunker, if you put this thing in your pocket (if it will fit) you will feel it.  Hell, it might even pull your pants down.  The thickness also makes it awkward to write in since it never folds flat and there is always resistance when jotting down an idea, which makes writing a chore (which is counter productive to the pocketbook ideal, which is maximum convenience).  If you are looking for a real nice small notebook, opt for a Moleskine.  Pass on this clunker
In answer to a music fan from Temple Hills, the song was called King Holiday by the King Dream Chorus & Holiday Crew. It came out on Mercury in 1986 and featured the singers and rappers you mentioned. It made no.30 on the R&B Charts but didn't crossover pop. The lyrics are on the net (try Google) but I don't know if the song still is
Completely worthless! If you liked the film, go buy the DVD because this album has no redeeming qualities.  The sound quality is fair at best, even for a live album.  Almost every track is jammed with totally worthless `commentary' at the beginning or end of the song.  The `commentary' consists of recordings of about a dozen people having random conversations over the phone and laughing for no reason.  It would have been nice if they had put these `commentaries' on different tracks because the way they have it on this CD you have to wait through about a minute and a half of this crap to get to the song you want to hear.  The worst part about the album is the lack of The Fugees, which means no `Killing Me Softly'.  Sadly, you can tell that most of the artists on this album haven't played a show or practiced in a long time as they are a bit rusty and sound horrible, even for a live recording.  Some of them sounded almost as bad as Fallout Boy on SNL
Eternity was signature scent of the late 80's early 90's and has been around long enough to gain a rightful, classic status now. --- It is one of the best on the market, it smells classy, clean, zingy and has more than a touch of the erotic about it. --- Always worth having a bottle handy even if you don't wear it everyday, it is a yummy, scrummy scent
My sister loved her necklace. She was very pleased with it, and so am I
This movie gave me constipation that the Gods have never seen!  Not to  mention uncontrolable vomiting. When I was a young Russian Jewish boy ,  before I moved to my navite Japan, I had a pet lizard named Ruby. I loved  to pet his long hairy back while I fed him seaweed and chives. He always  loved cilantro (on the side).  Have I ever told you about my uncle Clair?  He was 5'6" and 423 Lbs. and wore a 48 DDD bro(TM). Oops! I droped my  match! I have to go. My parrot is on fire
I got this camera for my 17th birthday last summer, and it's great. As much as I'd love to have a Canon Powershot, it's a bit out of my price range. All the people who think that using the LCD screen runs out the batteries after "2-4 pictures" are lying to you. I bought rechargable batteries from radioshack, and I've taken up to 400 picture without the batteries needing to be changed. This is a good camera with good quality in good lighting. In dark or overcast situations, it can look a bit grainy, but that's easily photoshopped. I recommend that when uploading, plug it into the wall with a digital camera adapter, because uploading sucks all battery power right out. I recommend this for someone who hasn't owned a digital camera before, or for someone that wants good quality at a not-so-crazy price
While I only own one game for the DS, what makes it so great is the wifi ability to play with friends. I have spent a couple afternoons at a friend's house with several other people, all playing Mario Kart against each other, and it was a fun time full of excitement with people yelling, for either being knocked back from 1st to dead last, or managing to squeeze out the win at the last second. ---  --- The touch screen is also a great addition to the DS. Some games allow either the touch screen or the standard controls to be used, depending on preference. Others, like Mario Kart, stick to the standard controls, and others require the use of just the touch screen, creating a very unique kind of game. ---  --- The Lite is also an improvement of the first DS. While it may not be worth it to upgrade if you already have the first DS, it is worth it if it will be your only DS. The Lite is better shaped, has a better battery life, and better, brighter screens. The DS Lite certainly is a great handheld console
I bought this product because I had tried with great success another Punch product. It was so easy to use and load onto my computer. It was a great value to be able to have one product that allows me to redesign anything from interior floors and walls, to my deck and plants outside
The box is soft, and very durable. But it is a bit big.
Well, they looked so cool on TV that I ordered 2 of them and I regret it. It's awkward to get the hook back into the "rocket" once the bait is on. I took my son fishing with them and what we ended up doing is not launching them out of the gun/rod. We left the pod open with the bait on the hook and dropped it into the water and let it drift with the current. I've come to find that buying cheesey little rods and reels are simply a waste of money. If you're going to take a little one out fishing, just use your own and let them reel yours in until their big enough to handle a decent set up. The only reason I gave this 2 stars is because it was a neat IDEA. [...]
I am 67 years old and started out in photography as a kid with a contact printer and a box camera. I have had all types of cameras over the years, mostly 35mm film Canon slr's. I too bought all sorts of these 5-7 MP point and shoot digital cameras before returning to my true love, SLR's. I have had my digital Canon Rebel XT about a month now and I can't keep my hands off of it. It lacks nothing. Although the kit lense is good, I bought a 28-135 Canon zoom lense with image stabilizion and have produced stunning photo's with it. I love the way you can use the 7 points to focus, I mainly use only the center point with focus lock and never get an out of focus picture. I guess the nicest thing for me is that I now don't have the urge to buy every point and shoot camera that is paraded out on QVC or HSN that has a "wonderful" new feature like "low light or non-shake." This Canon has every good feature in the known universe and you can't outgrow it. Its a camera that will let you be as good as you can be, it won't hold you back. The battery life is great, the built in flash is good but I bought a 430EX and that's even better. I never figure I'm wasting money buying accessories for this camera as it will be my main squeeze for many years to come. I always missed my 35mm Canon slr's and now feel that I have an old friend back again, only much much better. Believe me, you can't go wrong getting this camera, its beyond description...
This is my third digital camera, I bought it after my tot dunked my previous camera under water.   I did a lot of research before I bought this and it was highly rated in Consumer Reports. ---  --- After a few months of ok pictures (the macro setting is not very good though) the lens cover started sticking but I learned to live with it.  I would manually open up the lens cover each time.  Then the lens cover got stuck in the open position and I was learning to live with that.   But now the camera is almost completely dead.  It will not power up properly and sometimes it beeps.  I'm not sure but I think I am out of the warranty period with this. ---  --- I will not buy another Canon Camera.  This camera was made too cheaply.  I wish things were not made to break right away
Among the various offerings available, this is perhaps the most complete. Each offerings has some unique capabilities that others don't possess; but if you want only one product this one gives you the closest match to a professional product that can be used by print shops
Just received radio yesterday, and am returning radio today! Pluses.... adequate LCD display and good illumination while on AC adapter. Good thumbwheel tuning in 1 Khz increments. Adequate speaker fidelity for small radio. However, the volume slew buttons have set "numbered" volume levels, and between settings of 5-6, there is a BIG noticeable increase in volume(not good), and while tuning shortwave bands, every approx 100Khz increment, there appears to be a "null" area, where signal meter reads a signal received, but quiet speaker. Also, on FM, if hands are near the radio, the signal breaks up(for weaker signals, not strong ones), and compared to my Grundig 400-PE, which I feel the sensitivity is not good and the hiss is bothersome, the Eton E-5 seems worse still!!! I am returning this today, and obtaining the Sony 7600GR instead. Eton E-5, not bad, but certainly not worth 3 stars or above, especially, if comparing it to another similar size radio, and then comparing it to my Sony 2010. 
As soon as I got this item, I tried it out right away.  I will agree the battery cover is rather flimsy but that's a minor point.  The real issue is whether it could do what it claims to do -- take down mosquitos and flys.  Sure enough, I killed 5 mosquitos after sitting outside for just a few minutes.  I also took down a housefly without any sweat.  This is a great device as mosquitos are a real problem where I'm at and it sucks being held hostage indoors by insects.  No more an issue
It's a little on the thin side for snowy or freezing weather, but great in keeping the chill off when you're out and about, or at the game. The blue is actually more of a royal blue than navy blue, but the lettering is well stitched and is the same quality used on MLB baseball caps (also has the MLB logo on back). It folds up easily and can be tucked into a jacket pocket with room to spare. The price is great and makes a great gift
I have had this for almost 6 months and I like it a lot.  Right off, it looks great.  Black leather, blue piping going around the edge.  The blue is that vivid color that one of those exotic/expensive fish tank fish have:  neons or tetras?  Whichever it is, it is very sharp looking. ---  --- I keep i860 cell phone in the 'Glove all the time.  It does not add much bulk/size/weight to the phone.  It fits it, after all, like a glove. ---  --- When I am taking a photo, I simply unsnap the half that is on the flip-up half of my cell phone which is where the camera lens is, take the photo, and slip it back on.   ---  --- Before I used to know about this, I used to press down a little strap on it that would get in the way, like a wayward lock of hair.  Turns out that futzing with the strap is unnecessary.  They designed it so you can just remove that half of the case, take photo(s), and snap it back on.  Smart. ---  --- In fact, the reason the strap is there in the first place is so you can easily remove the other half.  Look what is on the end of that strap before you curse it, guys.   It's a snap!  Snaps unsnap; that is what they are for. ---  --- The glove is well named.  It makes the phone much easier to grip in your hand.  I can easily pivot it around in my hand, flip it around, pick it up, and basically not expect it to skid around.  Without the 'Glove, you have a bare metal or plastic case.  Smooth looking and - well, maybe too smooth for something small and costing hundreds of dollars! ---  --- I like the fast release for the belt hook.  So far, it has not failed me.  I think it is at the bottom, not at the back the way some people have said, but I cannot remember for certain. I know it goes off and on easily for me but has never come off on its own yet. ---  --- I don't use it that way much though.  The i860 is not much bigger than one of those little matchbox cars from the 1960s. I easily fit it in my pocket.  With the glove on, I know it is probably not going to get scratched too easily
My boyfriend buys this magazine and likes it a lot. I also take a look at it because in addition to tastefully photographed beautiful women there are a lot of things in it that makes it very interesting even for women. For example, there are fresh articles about fashion, cars, gadgets, sex and even celebrities. I read them with interest and skip the models, which I guess are the main entertaining element in the magazine for the guys. Well, that's fine. I am a beautiful woman as well and my boyfriend doesn't rely only on tips from such magazines to keep me very satisfied but also on bestsellers such as scientfically guaranteed male multiple orgasms and ultimate sex. That's why I don't mind when he lists Maxim and enjoys the photographed beautiful women. Maxim can definitely satisfy the hunger for such eye candies of every man who has a strong and happy relationship without getting in trouble. Overall, it is a very good, high quality magazine, which has a lot to offer both as photographs and information, and I am sure that you will enjoy each issue.
Eventually, anyone who makes it their business to seek out quality horror movies is going to come to the conclusion that the ones that succeed in distinguishing themselves from the pack tend to fall into three distinct categories. First, you have the horror movies that are less interested in scaring you than they are seriously exploring their subject matter, and probing into the nature of evil. Sometimes, they go the supernatural route (The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, Don't Look Now). Sometimes, they stay grounded (Psycho, Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, Se7en). Either way, they are more disturbing than they are immediately frightening. You acknowledge that what you've seen has struck a kind of nerve, but you won't lose much sleep. These movies are  intellectually compelling but they do not provoke any immediate sense of terror. ---  --- On the other hand, the second breed of quality horror movies has no interest in psychology, in the "nature" of their content, and do not attempt to intellectually engage you. They only want to make you feel as if you are in immediate danger. The movies that fall into this category (Halloween, Alien) do not provide food for thought, but they know how to make you uncomfortable, and they know how to push your buttons. They are manipulative in the extreme, but they are actively frightening, and provide visceral experiences that the previous category of horror films cannot.  ---  --- Finally, the third category of superlative horror films distinguish themselves by remaining conscious of themselves. They want to frighten you, but they also want to convince you that they are "above" merely pushing your buttons. At the same time, they don't want to go the intellectual route either. These films (Scream, Dawn of the Dead) are made by people who know the genre, know that the audience knows the genre, and toe a thin line between adhering to genre conventions and examining those conventions explicitly. These films are very effective, even if they are too cool for the room. You laugh knowingly, and then, bam, something truly frightening wipes that smirk right off your face. ---  --- Bernard Rose's "Candyman" is a rarity in that it falls into all three of these categories. It is intellectually stimulating and it knows a great deal about the nature of evil, but it is also, truly, viscerally frightening. It is self-aware and yet, it is not too cool for the room, and there is no comfortable distance to be found from the nightmare that unfolds on the screen. It is as immediately frightening as the orginal Halloween, it is as thought-provoking as The Exorcist, and it is as aware as itself as the Scream trilogy. You've never seen anything quite like it before, and you probably won't see anything like it again. ---  ---  The plot of Candyman centers around a woman who is as much of an agnostic when it comes to the intangible world as one could imagine; she boldly pursues strides into the haunts of a malevolent spiritual force (the Cabrini Green Housing Projects in Chicago, which are dangerous enough without factoring evil spirits into the equation) in search of discovering the source of the legend of the Candyman, a man with a hook for an arm who can be summoned by repeating his name into a mirror five times. She is convinced, as any liberal pseudo-sociologist might be, that the Candyman is but a projection of the fears the urban poor have of gang/drug-related violence. The fact that there is a gang leader who has taken to calling himself the Candyman reinforces this conviction. ---  --- For this woman, the idea that there is evil in the world, pure evil, unconditioned by economic/racial (most of the residents of Cabrini Green are poor and black) factors is unthinkable. She does not believe that the Candyman is anything more than an idea. She is wrong. The Candyman is real, and he doesn't much like the challenge to his authority posed by her skepticism. Furthermore, she reminds him of someone from his past whom he wishes to be reunited with, and thus he comes to view her as a conquest on more levels than one. ---  --- For about half of the film, we follow the woman, played by Virginia Madsen, and her friend, played by Kasi Lemmons, as they trek through Cabrini, exchange notes, and conduct the affairs of their lives. Madsen's grad student is no different from a lot of young people. She is determined to make a mark on her field, she's a little suspicious about her husband's fidelity, she smokes, she's pretty, she's intelligent and she seems nice enough. She draws our sympathy. ---  --- However, midway through the film, there is a decisive rupture, and everything in Madsen's life begins to unravel at an alarming rate. The chain of events that follow a particularly frightening scene in a parking lot take on the logic of a nightmare that one is unable to escape from. Soon, everything we have come to know about the young woman we've been following, all of the connections she has to her friends, to her husband, to humanity in general seem to be undone. It would be unfair to describe exactly what happens, but let it be said that the final fifty minutes of Candyman are as frightening as anything I've seen on film. ---  --- We thought we were safe, after all. The character we'd been following had friends, family, a job, a life of her own. The possibility of coming into conflict with nothing less than pure evil was the farthest thing from her mind; she and her friend were more concerned about packing the requisite mace for their journey through the projects, more afraid of drug dealers than of demons. After all, the Candyman is an urban legend, and we know all about urban legends. They're campfire stories. There is no Boogeyman, not really.  ---  --- Rose plays on the self-conscious approach we take to horror films by decisively arguing that it will not save us. He engages us intellectually by toying with the idea of whether the Candyman is literally real, or only becomes literally real if enough people are afraid of him (I'll leave that up to you to decide). And he frightens us at an immediate level by pulling the rug out from under us at a crucial moment, and by never allowing us to regain our footing. It doesn't hurt that he has an uncanny eye for frightening visuals (the bees swallowing the Chicago skyline, the Candyman's self-portrait), plus the help of a terrific soundtrack from Philip Glass (whose presence reminds us that, hey, this is a serious piece of art) and compelling performances on all levels. Not to mention a great idea, and, yes, the ability to push our buttons and manipulate us when he wants to. ---  --- Candyman is, as far as I'm concerned, the second most frightening film ever made; the original Halloween still remains the only movie that made me briefly fear for my own safety. But I would argue that the horror genre has produced no more complete work of art-- no other film that engages the viewer on every conceivable level they could ask to be engaged on-- than Rose's masterpiece. Halloween becomes exponentially less scary with repeated viewings, as you begin to get the sequence down and figure out what's coming. Candyman's power remains undiminished, even once you get the sequence down, because the scares give way to the ideas.  ---  --- Don't miss it.  ---  --- Rated R: Contains some very graphic gore (nothing that will  really surprise those used to the genre, but this movie does get pretty ugly by any standard-- seriously, who said this wasn't gory enough?) some language, and brief nudity (not in a sexual context)
It Could Happen to You was a bit of a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Nicolas Cage, Bridget Fonda, and Rosie Perez among others. --- The movie brings to the screen the story of a policeman who after winning 4 million dollars on the NY state lotto, decides to share half of it with a waitress he met the previous day.   --- The acting is surprisingly (!) below average, the dialogues are way below average, while the plot is not bad at all.   --- Nicolas Cage's character is too naive and too slow, and that was just sad/pitiful! --- Bridget Fonda was unexpectedly plain and bland. --- Rosie Perez's character was overly exaggerated to the point that it got tiring AND annoying very early on. --- As for Wendell Pierce and Stanley Tucci this film does not seem to be their thing; they don't seem to belong.  Subsequently, they are not convincing in their roles at all. --- Finally, somebody shoot the "Narrator," PLEASE! --- Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...  No masterpiece here. --- If Nicolas Cage is what you had in mind, check out the AMAZING movies City of Angels and/or The Family Man.
I use PowerPoint a great deal as a teacher and thought this would upgrade my presentations. Unfortunately, every one of my computers had insufficient video memory to allow the software to work. For now, it sits on my shelf until I can purchase more powerful equipment. Certainly not for the casual user. It isn't the magic black box that will make you a star
I recieved this item yesterday.  Initaly I was very happy, it changed my 8GB black ipod into a green ipod and did a rather good job of it.  The inner skin is a clear white-ish frosted color allowing the original ipod color to show through, I would have preferred an opaque white, but it did not look terribly bad with the green, though blue, red, or any other color than green would have been better with the black I had not the inital foresight to picture this. I was still pretty happy at this point. The hip-clip was removed right away, I have been looking for a nano cover that would allow me to dock to my Logitech MM50 (portable speaker)  without taking it out of the case, eureka, this case did that, without the clip of course.  The lanyard was an added bonus until earlier today I discovered the clips that held the lanyard in place had widened the aperature connections on the iPod nano, so that I would never trust it on the lanyard for fear it would fall off and be lost.  Well, I was still happy with the color change and the ability to sit in my portable speakers without taking it off. Unitl, I discovered a surface scratch on the green coloring of the case. Now, despite the fact that this is the "Aluminum" iSkin Duo, this was not the case at all.  The green metalic colored plastic is painted with an aluminum look.  Okay that was still acceptable, until, I discovered what looked to be a surface layer peeling off, sugesting that eventualy the color would flake away. That was it, that was the broke back camel inducement, and now I am the proud owner of a case that I will never be happy with. At first I had been all excited, and was considering the purchase of other colors, not now, this in my consideration was a waste of money. Hopefully I'll confirm that my ipod can still link to the cradle inspite of the clip damage the lanyard has done. ---  --- Sincerly --- Ro
Pocky are good if your a new to the japanese sugar covered biscut style of food. i perfer yan yan i believe they have more substance. but are more messy if you dont have biscut dipping skills. 
Great flavored soup that you don't have to start from scratch.  Very healthy choice
The pins for the curlers are awkward and hard to use.  I don't like them
While I personally love and eat tons of organic and natural foods, I have to say the $30 I spent on this case of cookies was a waster.  Neither of my children will eat them, nor will I.  They have a smell that once you get in your nose hinders any attempt at enjoying the very small bit of flavor they have.  Nature's Path makes great cereal and energy bars but fall short with these cookies.  Stick with the chocolate or peanut butter and you are okay.  The honey grahams will sit in your cupboard until trash day
There was a click in the crankshaft that was loud enough to be heard while riding and felt by the foot through the left pedal every 360 degrees of pedal rotation. ---  --- I purhased a crank puller tool for $21.44 (incl tax), a crank wrench for $18.18 (incl. tax), and grease for $6.38 to repair this brand new bicycle. ---  --- Upon disassembly I found two (2) metal shavings, each about 0.25 inches in size, that appeared to be from drilling.  I have saved the two (2) metal shavings. ---  --- I removed the metal shavings, cleaned and re-greased, and the clicking noise and vibration was fixed. ---  --- Since this was a brand new bicycle, it would seem reasonable to reimburse me for the tools required to repair it.  The total cost, not including and labor, is $46.00.
When you have dirt in your food you have to wonder about what you are really eating. Otherwise the flavor wasn't bad. I just can't eat the dirt. It's bad for the teeth
I wear it almost everyday and it's a lot of fun to change out the wrist band
The singing is terrible on "Fly Me To The Moon".  Don't take my word for it.  Listen to the free sample supplied by Amazon.com .  At 16 seconds into it, when she sings "all I worship and adore", she goes almost a whole note sharp for several notes!  Even someone with no musical training can hear it. ---  --- The rest of the pieces sound fine
I didn't think it was difficult to set up but it clearly isn't designed well.  The target that hangs inside the cage doesn't actually fit.   And..... the netting doesn't stop the balls.  How's that for a good product.  1 out of 5 balls rips right through the net.   ---  --- Buy anything else
I love my Birkenstock shoes.  They fill great.  I am a registered nurse. I am on my feet constantly all day.  These shoes are great for the support my feet need.  They are really comfortable. I will definately be purchasing more in the near future. 
Every mother/father should definitely purchase a baby monitor. Until this came I could not leave my baby while she slept to go do the dishes and what not. The receiver side is battery operated, so even if I walk around the house I can here my baby. Even the smallest sound is picked up! Amazing. I haven't tried other monitors, but this one is perfect and inexpensive, so I would recommend it to anyone
Not really being into the original GTA III (and its birds-eye-view predecessors), I became unfortunately addicted to to San Andreas. The game play is absorbing and the storyline and cinematics are, despite the dated graphics, engaging. Maybe the most impressive aspect of the entire game is the impressive cinematic scene voice acting, which makes you forget about some of the jerky animations. ---  --- The game play is free-ranging, but if you don't pursue the main storyline missions (which are linear, but multiple storylines let you pursue them in any priority) the gratuitous violence you can commit is ultimately unrewarding and difficult to get away with (as it should be). The moral criticisms of the game include being able to randomly assault innocent bystanders without repurcussions, but for the most part, there are repurcussions if nearby police see you doing so. My criticism would be that there are not enough repurcussions for street violence, because it would certainly make that aspect of the game more challenging. If you go on a rampage in a local store, the clerks don't try to call the police or evade. They instead just take a beating or a bullet. The AI of some of the rival gangs is a little clumsy too, as they will simply start shooting at you if they see your colors, despite the presence of squad cars or bike cops across the street. The cops in San Andreas are corrupt, but not that corrupt. ---  --- GTA SA definitely feels like a ported title rather than a game developed for PC. Some of the interface and in-game menus are awkward and designed to be PS2 gamepad friendly. Saving the game is a bit of a pain as well, since you have to retreat to your "safe-house" to save everytime. ---  --- A fun and engrossing game for adults, but let this be known: if you let your under-18 child play this game, you are an awful parent and deserve to have social services come and whisk your precious babies away. Aside from the violence, San Andreas is rife with profanity and innuendo, and is probably not really suitable for anyone under 40. There is no "safe" mode or low-gore level for this game like some other titles (while the game is overly violent, gore is minimal anyway)
This was purchased for my daughter for her 15th Birthday.  She is very deeply interested in Shakespeare and all his works but especially Romeo and Juliet.  I saw this version when it was released originally in theaters and wanted her to have the experience of seeing these 2 actors.  I thought it was beautifully done then and she loves it now.  Impressive that Mom and daughter enjoy this movie when the music of today's teens and much of their other interests are definitely not Mom's thing. 
the mia series are great for our family.  the kids always look forward to playing their mia games.  they have the math adventure and grandmas remedy.  the two disc thing is confusing...but really doesn't interrupt play.  the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because it can be a little glitchy sometimes...mia will get stuck somewhere and not respond.  we just go back to a game saved in a similar spot and restart.  so it's not too big a deal.
I bought the game for my daughter, but I play it more than she does. This game will give you hours of enjoyment if you love Super Mario Bros
This movie starts off blazing hot and ends up ice cold.  Martin does a great job with Nick Nolte as an artist in "life lessons" and i thought after this story that i was in for a real treat of a film but after watching Ford Coppolas somthing Zoe i began to tire and by the end of Woody Allens snoozefest i was bored stiff.  My advice is to watch the first 30 minutes and then turn this one off.  The first 30 minutes is GREAT film followed but very average film and ending with truley awful film. 
This cover is what my "baby blackberry" needed to be protected and safe
Flavored coffee creamers have been a guilty pleasure of mine for a long time now, but even if you buy the sugar-free kind, you're ingesting a whopping 1 gram of fat per tablespoon of creamer. As if that weren't bad enough, it's partially HYDROGENATED!  --- Splenda Flavor Blends is a wonderful alternative if you're like me and just can't face black coffee. Please note that this is not a creamer. It sweetens/flavors coffee. If you find you just have to have creamer to "tame" down your coffee you can add a Splenda Flavor blend and a splash of skim milk or if you like things more creamy, buy some powdered non-fat milk and add that along with the Splenda Flavor blends. --- Lots of times, I find products with Splenda already in them to be too sweet but I didn't think that was the case with this. All three of the available flavors (hazelnut, mocha, vanilla) taste great without being overpowering.  --- Finally, now I can kick that fatty creamer bad habit!
I received this 2CD set in the mail and was horrified at the sound quality of the so called "mastering".  I have original un-mastered copies of some REO Speedwagon albums that sound BETTER than this set!  I love REO to death and the track listing is good to go, but in all honesty, this compilation falls flat on its face in regards to sound quality.  The band seriously needs to find a good remasterer and give the fans what they have been waiting for.  I cannot recommend any previous greatest hits releases that even come close.  Save your money and wait
This is a great foodie magazine. We think the writing is what makes it great. It is always interesting, has some recipes to try and is not the usual food mag stuff. Very enjoyable
This is the best long-wearing lipstick I have ever bought. It lasts on me for about 6-7 hours...through meals, drinks, etc. The best part is that it isn't flakey. It also has little hints of "glitter" in it, that really make your lips shine. The icing on the cake is that it has a subtle watermelon smell.
I've had my Treo for a month and heavily use it for many applications, I especially love having the Goodlink email application, my family videos, mp3's, pics, and all my office documents at a touch of a finger. Yes the battery life goes quickly but I don't mind charging my treo every night. ---  --- The slick and slim design is a real eye catcher and feel great in the hand.[...] ---  --- in the one month of usage, my Treo has hung, one time, a simple reset fixed it and hasn't hung since
This is absolutely the best concealer EVER. I have skin that is very sensitive and prone to breakouts with face makeup - this stuff hasn't been a problem! It stays put all day long, and does not shine
Manufacturer would be better off providing extra legs, as this device is very fragile.  Not a good consumer product
These socks are a bit on the thin side, but they withstand a lot of wear
One thing which mystifies me is how few people have embraced the latest in modern clock technology: radio controlled clocks which keep exact time by automatically synchronizing themselves with signals broadcast from the incredibly accurate U.S. atomic clock in Boulder Colorado. Such clocks are not only always accurate to a fraction of a second, they also automatically set themselves to and from daylight savings and standard time as appropriate. Furthermore, such clocks are typically quite reasonable in price. Yet while most Americans have, for example, the latest in modern cordless phones and cell phones, relatively few have the accuracy and convenience of radio controlled clocks. This model is just one of many styles sold by Amazon and other vendors. Try one and I think you'll be glad you did. My wife and I have several of these clocks throughout our house and take accurate time for granted, no what time system is in effect
