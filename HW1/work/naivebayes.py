"""
NaiveBayes is a generative classifier based on the Naive assumption that features are independent from each other
P(w1, w2, ..., wn|y) = P(w1|y) P(w2|y) ... P(wn|y)
Thus argmax_{y} (P(y|w1,w2, ... wn)) can be modeled as argmax_{y} P(w1|y) P(w2|y) ... P(wn|y) P(y) using Bayes Rule
and P(w1, w2, ... ,wn) is constant with respect to argmax_{y} 
Please refer to lecture notes Chapter 4 for more details
