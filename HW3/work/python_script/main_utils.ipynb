      " Isaac Florentine has made some of the best western Martial Arts action movies ever produced. In particular US Seals 2, Cold Harvest, Special Forces and Undisputed 2 are all action classics. You can tell Isaac has a real passion for the genre and his films are always eventful, creative and sharp affairs, with some of the best fight sequences an action fan could hope for. In particular he has found a muse with Scott Adkins, as talented an actor and action performer as you could hope for. This is borne out with Special Forces and Undisputed 2, but unfortunately The Shepherd just doesn't live up to their abilities.<br /><br />There is no doubt that JCVD looks better here fight-wise than he has done in years, especially in the fight he has (for pretty much no reason) in a prison cell, and in the final showdown with Scott, but look in his eyes. JCVD seems to be dead inside. There's nothing in his eyes at all. It's like he just doesn't care about anything throughout the whole film. And this is the leading man.<br /><br />There are other dodgy aspects to the film, script-wise and visually, but the main problem is that you are utterly unable to empathise with the hero of the film. A genuine shame as I know we all wanted this film to be as special as it genuinely could have been. There are some good bits, mostly the action scenes themselves. This film had a terrific director and action choreographer, and an awesome opponent for JCVD to face down. This could have been the one to bring the veteran action star back up to scratch in the balls-out action movie stakes.<br /><br />Sincerely a shame that this didn't happen.\n",

      " Isaac Florentine has made some of the best western Martial humanistic discipline action movies ever produce. In particular United States sealing wax 2, cold Harvest, Special Forces and Undbeputed 2 are all action classics. You can tell Isaac has a real passionateness for the genre and hbe movie are always eventful, creative and sharp affairs, with some of the best battle sequences an action fan could hope for. In particular he has found a muse with George C. Scott Adkins, as talented an actor and action performer as you could hope for. Thbe be bear out with Special Forces and Undbeputed 2, but unluckily The shepherd just doesn't populate up to their abilities.<bromine /><bromine />There be no doubt that JCVD looks better here battle-wbee than he has make in years, particularly in the battle he has (for pretty much no reason) in a prbeon cell, and in the final showdown with George C. Scott, but look in hbe eyes. JCVD seems to be dead inside. There's nothing in hbe eyes at all. It's like he just doesn't care about anything throughout the whole movie. And thbe be the leading man.<bromine /><bromine />There are other dodgy aspects to the movie, script-wbee and vbeually, but the main problem be that you are absolutely unable to empathbee with the hero of the movie. A genuine shame as I know we all desire thbe movie to be as special as it truly could have be. There are some good bits, mostly the action scenes themselves. Thbe movie have a terrific director and action choreographer, and an awesome opposition for JCVD to face down. Thbe could have be the one to bromineing the veteran action star back up to scratch in the balls-out action movie stakes.<bromine /><bromine />sincerely a shame that thbe maken't happen.\n",
